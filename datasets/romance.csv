I fell in love two years ago, exactly on December 31st 2017. Now, I am young and still feel like I have so many things to learn. I have never wanted to marry or have kids or start a family or spend the rest of my life with someone, most of it due to watching how my parents were and are ever since I was a little child. Love for me was what I saw in movies and for me it was liking someone and having your heart beat fast and for someone to think you are attractive and to kiss and hold hands. That changed for me when I fell in love for the first time but it didn't last. The guy led me on and shamed me for loving him in front of all my peers and friends and seniors. 

I wasn't even looking for love when I found HIM. I met him at New Year's Eve thing and at first, he seemed weird and unusual and to me not that far from possibly...crazy. I thought that was the last time I would see him but little did I know that I would see him again the next day and the day after and the day after and the day after. Somehow, we kept randomly bumping into each other and we started talking. Four days into it, I had become his friend and was about to leave when I was hanging out with him and our friends when our eyes met over the crowd and I swear to mother-fu\*king god, his eyes were the most gorgeous I've ever seen. I actually couldn't breathe in the moment and I still recall the moment exactly, starting with where he was and I was, what I was wearing, what he was wearing, our surroundings, etc. I'm not going to tell you it was love at first sight. It definitely wasn't. 

I just grew a crush on him.

Suddenly, I was flipping into chances to know him, to meet him, to be with him. I hung out with his friends and day by day, I got to know him better. Everything that I saw from the way he giggled instead of laughed to teasing his older brother on being shorter than him to his quiet eyes that scanned his surroundings to the way he could goof off and starting singing the Minions theme song but immediately become serious to his funny antics got me heading straight for the hills. The last straw for how I truly knew I loved him was when I saw him working day and night to achieve his dream  and nearly pass out.

I fell in love around three or four or five months into it. 

It's been two years guys. I have gotten to know him better and I have seen his flaws from his insecurities to his sometimes mean behavior to how superficial he can be to naive to being stupid to many other things that I can't say. They have ALL made me love him even more and I find myself excited, thrilled, positively beaming to find out more flaws and more secrets and more hidden stories that I find myself already holding a place in my heart to keep locked up. I fall deeper and deeper and deeper for him everyday and that love just grew bigger. He held me as I was crying, falling hard into my eating disorder and getting treatment and therapy to watching me get so angry I nearly broke everything in my house and he still held me. Guys, he stood by me when everyone left. He told me it was going to be okay, he made me feel loved and he made me smile when my parents told me to leave and how worthless I am. My sweet beautiful boy was there every single step of the way and all I pray now, all I beg of the world and God, is not to kiss him or hold his hands \[ which I also really want \] but to support him, to hold him when he is sad and be the first person he tells when he is happy, to hold his hands as he breaks and to stand by him and help him heal if he ever needs me. I want to take care of him when he is sick, give him massages when he is stressed, cheer the loudest when he accomplishes his dream, hug him after he has a bad day and so many things that I can't even begin to decipher. 

But he has a beautiful, talented, smart, nice girlfriend who can give him what he deserves.

I can't help but think he deserves an angel after seeing the boy who started bawling his eyes out when his friends were stressed and didn't get the job they wanted.

What do I do? Do I pursue him or leave him be? If I can support him and love him quietly from the sides as his best friend or even friend and if he truly loves her and she makes him happy, I will not interfere even though my heart shatters every time I think about it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the thing.

It's somewhat misleading title, but I run dungeons and dragons games as a past time. This typically is met with not so enthusiasm to girls I try to pursue, and the ones who don't care usually have no interest in me.

My friend, we'll call him Gary, is a Cello player and so he sometimes goes to this place that is called Lil Violins or something like that. One day he decides to go while we are carpooling and geeks out over various things in store.

Well, the counter girl was really cute and helpful. Me being me, after a bit of time, started up conversation with her. We talked about books, games and movies. When DnD got brought up (I explained Im the DnD nerd and my friend is the music nut) she started asking questions about it.

Eventually Gary yells ""He's a dungeon master!"" which had her respond in pleading me to teach her. So I wrote my dungeon master alias, Skellie, along with my number on a sticky note and asked her to get in touch with me for a later meet up.

The next day she texted, and we scheduled a character creation date at a local game shop. We looked at dice, got to business, and of course got off track. We spent most of the day talking about other interests, random trivia we know, and watched random videos. This is very typical of DnD sessions done in person.

We ended up leaving there agreeing to meet wednesdays for sessions with Gary, but we couldn't do it that upcoming wednesday. So we instead scheduled a potential group bonding exercise and headed to the movies. Gary and friends all used the same excuse to bow out last minute, that they had work, so it was just violin girl and me.

Prior to us meeting, Gary told me that she was probably using dnd as an excuse to see me and she had a crush on me. I am completely clueless to these kinds of things, sooo.... I asked her directly. She didn't give me a straight answer until half way through the film, after noticing she was leaning one way, I told her she could lean on me. Instead of using me as a rest, we went in for the kiss. It was then that she admitted she ""might have a little crush on me.""

So my very significant other (also male) wants me to fulfil my promise of living next to him. 

The only problem is he's now married.

And yes, we have ~~already slept several times~~ a history together.

We were best friends and roommates when we were in uni. He was in Engineering and I was in Business Ad so we never had classes together, but apart from classes we were pretty much together every time. We were also very physical, you know, like holding hands, hugging, and stuff, which, frankly, are not unusual in this side of the planet. I mean they're not automatically signs of gayness. It was for me, but I was never sure if it was the same for him. 

I mean I liked him more than just a bro from the onset but I never really had the courage to confess to him nor to ask him about it. Although people like us enjoy a much more tolerating society compared to other Asian countries, it's still some sort of an unspoken taboo and most parents would tend to force their children to hide their non-heterosexuality.

Fast forward to our final year in school, he had  a girlfriend. As expected, the girlfriend was the overly jealous type and would complain about the amount of time V.S.O. and I would spend together. She would even read our chats in between classes and would sometimes confront me about why V.S.O. would say he loves me, or that his mom wants to cook dinner for me the coming weekend. It got to a point where she would call me and beg me to give V.S.O and her some time to spend together and I would always say yes to it, despite my broken heart. 

They got into a fight for some unknown reason and the next thing I know, she had one of her guy friends who also live in our dorm to take a picture of myself and V.S.O. cuddling while asleep I think you can guess what happened after that.

V.S.O. being the coward that he was, went on academic leave and flew to Canada to study English. I was left alone to handle the disaster of being outed to the whole school who felt like it was their business to know who I was sleeping with. 

It was hell walking through corridors and literally everyone in the cafeteria would stay away from the table where I would eat and they would whisper / talk about me being the gay dude who spread my gayness and converted someone's boyfriend / made someone queer...as if that's remotely possible!

&amp;#x200B;

It was too much and I contemplated suicide but luckily I found a job and my professors agreed to let me work, it was my final semester anyway, and I was only left with a handful of general education courses -- no major ones. They gave me D's and C's, but it was okay. At least I got out of school and successfully graduated.

&amp;#x200B;

I deleted my Facebook account and changed numbers and didn't have contact with him until after 2 years when we accidentally met in the subway near H.Y. university and I tried to run away from him but he ended up chasing me and we hugged and all the bad memories came back and I just cried and cried and cried.

We ended up having sex, for the first time, that night. It was amazing, probably because it felt like a confirmation that my feelings were actually reciprocated and that I didn't imagine all the memories I have of him.

This went on for a few months, I also had a boyfriend then, who I broke up with, FOR HIM!!!

Then he told me that his company decided to send him to the U.S. for a 5 year project (He works for a big car company) and that I should quit my job and join him there. I work for a big group of companies, though not as big as his, and I simply can't quit my job and blindly follow him to the U.S., right? 

So I decided against it and I don't know why but after that, I was never able to find a relationship that lasted for more than a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got a call from him 7 months later that he's coming home to get married and that he wanted me to be the best man. I was so offended by this that I cut contact with him again.

&amp;#x200B;

It's only this month that we established contact once again. We've had video call on Facebook for the longeeeest time and he was trying to convince me to come and join him again. He reminded me of our promise to live next to each other as we grow old. He said he still loves me and he wants to be with me. I believe that. But the problem is, he's married! I'm sure the wife doesn't even know about this side of him! I know that this is morally wrong so I really can't bring myself to say yes to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Sadly, however, I don't think I'll ever be able to find another significant other...

I feel like I should not be choosy and just accept this chance at being happy, even if it comes with a sh\*tty set of terms and conditions... what do you guys think? #HELPME","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;WARNING - LONG POST&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my very significant other (also male) wants me to fulfil my promise of living next to him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem is he&amp;#39;s now married.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, we have &lt;del&gt;already slept several times&lt;/del&gt; a history together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were best friends and roommates when we were in uni. He was in Engineering and I was in Business Ad so we never had classes together, but apart from classes we were pretty much together every time. We were also very physical, you know, like holding hands, hugging, and stuff, which, frankly, are not unusual in this side of the planet. I mean they&amp;#39;re not automatically signs of gayness. It was for me, but I was never sure if it was the same for him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean I liked him more than just a bro from the onset but I never really had the courage to confess to him nor to ask him about it. Although people like us enjoy a much more tolerating society compared to other Asian countries, it&amp;#39;s still some sort of an unspoken taboo and most parents would tend to force their children to hide their non-heterosexuality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to our final year in school, he had  a girlfriend. As expected, the girlfriend was the overly jealous type and would complain about the amount of time V.S.O. and I would spend together. She would even read our chats in between classes and would sometimes confront me about why V.S.O. would say he loves me, or that his mom wants to cook dinner for me the coming weekend. It got to a point where she would call me and beg me to give V.S.O and her some time to spend together and I would always say yes to it, despite my broken heart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They got into a fight for some unknown reason and the next thing I know, she had one of her guy friends who also live in our dorm to take a picture of myself and V.S.O. cuddling while asleep I think you can guess what happened after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V.S.O. being the coward that he was, went on academic leave and flew to Canada to study English. I was left alone to handle the disaster of being outed to the whole school who felt like it was their business to know who I was sleeping with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was hell walking through corridors and literally everyone in the cafeteria would stay away from the table where I would eat and they would whisper / talk about me being the gay dude who spread my gayness and converted someone&amp;#39;s boyfriend / made someone queer...as if that&amp;#39;s remotely possible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was too much and I contemplated suicide but luckily I found a job and my professors agreed to let me work, it was my final semester anyway, and I was only left with a handful of general education courses -- no major ones. They gave me D&amp;#39;s and C&amp;#39;s, but it was okay. At least I got out of school and successfully graduated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I deleted my Facebook account and changed numbers and didn&amp;#39;t have contact with him until after 2 years when we accidentally met in the subway near H.Y. university and I tried to run away from him but he ended up chasing me and we hugged and all the bad memories came back and I just cried and cried and cried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up having sex, for the first time, that night. It was amazing, probably because it felt like a confirmation that my feelings were actually reciprocated and that I didn&amp;#39;t imagine all the memories I have of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This went on for a few months, I also had a boyfriend then, who I broke up with, FOR HIM!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he told me that his company decided to send him to the U.S. for a 5 year project (He works for a big car company) and that I should quit my job and join him there. I work for a big group of companies, though not as big as his, and I simply can&amp;#39;t quit my job and blindly follow him to the U.S., right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided against it and I don&amp;#39;t know why but after that, I was never able to find a relationship that lasted for more than a month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a call from him 7 months later that he&amp;#39;s coming home to get married and that he wanted me to be the best man. I was so offended by this that I cut contact with him again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s only this month that we established contact once again. We&amp;#39;ve had video call on Facebook for the longeeeest time and he was trying to convince me to come and join him again. He reminded me of our promise to live next to each other as we grow old. He said he still loves me and he wants to be with me. I believe that. But the problem is, he&amp;#39;s married! I&amp;#39;m sure the wife doesn&amp;#39;t even know about this side of him! I know that this is morally wrong so I really can&amp;#39;t bring myself to say yes to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, however, I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll ever be able to find another significant other...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I should not be choosy and just accept this chance at being happy, even if it comes with a sh*tty set of terms and conditions... what do you guys think? #HELPME&lt;/p&gt;

So Jamal (M/18) and me (F/19) and I go to the same college. 

I met him through mutual friends. I’m not the type to initiate conversation with people because I have social anxiety. And usually when people do come up and talk to me and look past my awkwardness, jts rare. So this Jamal always comes up and talks to me about anything he can think of or anything we have in common, doesn’t matter what it is he will talk to me. For example we had a class together so he would ask me if I thought the homework was hard or if I knew how to do anything, stuff like that. And whenever I’m with the friend that introduced me to him, he will greet me first then her so I noticed that too. 

During our first semester, I’d been having a lot of mental health issues and just needed a break so I stopped going to class, idk where I’d be If I hadn’t have stopped going. But yeah everyday he would ask where I am to another one of our mutual friends and he would always say he misses me. At the time he didn’t have anyway to contact me outside of seeing each other in person. I went up to campus one day to visit my friends bc like I said I stopped going and my mutual friend texted him and and let him know I was here and he came to where we were and he gave me the biggest hug ever and told me he missed me. We talked for a little and he left so I thought that was sweet of him  

Another thing is he’s always sooo excited and happy to see me like he’s always hella smiley when I’m around. I’m kind of the same way lol. 

Recently like 3 days ago, me my two mutual friends and him all hung out. We went out for food and had a good time. That day is when i realized I like him. Idk what it was but we finally got to talk together and have some space from everyone and it was just us and we kinda clicked in my opinion. We were laughing the whole time. One of the friends that was with us pulled me aside and we went to the bathroom bc girls go to the br together lol but she was basically saying how she thinks he likes me and how since day one she’s been waiting for us to get together and stuff and she said the chemistry is there... she’s not wrong at all. And sometimes I noticed we would play fight like flirting a little. 

I didn’t even realize I liked him til that day tbh, but everything added up. Every time I we text I would kind of get nervous and wonder why now I know. Whenever I see him in person I get excited and I always want to hug him. And I genuinely think he’s such a sweetheart, he accepts me for who I am, I know that bc he actually took the tome to get to know me and get through the awkwardness, most people just think I’m weird and shy and rude so they stop talking to me but he didn’t do that... I guess he saw something in me? and he’s really cute and tall...❤️

One of our mutual friends told me “he likes you” and I asked him “did he say the three words?? I like (my name)” he said “well he said he enjoys your company and he says he misses you all the time, and he thinks you’re funny.” And that’s just not clear at all, that could mean anything. 

But let me get into why I’m unsure of his feelings for me... he’s friends with A LOT of people. And A LOT of girls... maybe I’m just one of those girls that he befriended. And when we first started knowing each other he asked me if I had any friends for him to date and he asked if one of my friends was single and stuff... and that moves me onto me not being his type. His type is “black and pretty” in his words. He even asked me if I could give him one of my friends number and they look NOTHING like me. I’m not the prettiest as I’m not hella skinny either. I don’t really wear makeup that often either so I just don’t know. 

So basically I just don’t know... I kind of just wanna come out and tell him straight on that I like him and why kind of like “confessing my love” except I don’t love him lol. but I don’t wanna ruin our friendship if things go south or if he just doesn’t feel the same. Honestly If one of our mutual friends could tell him and get his reaction I would be good. I would either stop hanging out where they dorm if he doesn’t like me OR I would come and hang out all the time if he does. Can someone help me know the best way to go about this?

We[20MF] have been in a rough LDR for 3 years. First 2 years went good with a bit of fights but it has been down road since then. 

We almost broke up since my gf [20F] wanted me to change and be better with her because I’ve hurt her emotionally so much but she still gave me another chance at the end of the year.

It’s been a week since then and she’s feeling like we’re being the same again. She told me she’s giving me a chance so I grow up, Change myself and become more mature and self aware. I took it serious but I didn’t know how to show her all that. 

She complained again 4 days ago that I’m not even trying anything. To make her feel happy or to even make her want me anymore even though she doesn’t feel much for me now. 

I really love her so much but I don’t know how to express that to her without really saying because she’s more of a person who prefers to see things happening that show efforts and that I am trying for her and us. But I don’t know what to do. 

Secondly, she’s been asking me to talk about something for 4 days since she’s been so frustrated with her family crises. And I don’t know what exactly to talk to her about. She says she talks to me and hopes to relax from all the stress and all but I only add up more to it. 


She keeps asking me to talk about something and if I do, all I can think about is talking about my problems or her problems or complimenting her or talking related to my family and she likes none of those to talk about because my family particularly doesn’t like her so much. 

So I want to ask is, what do I talk to her about when she says, “Talk about something else.” But doesn’t feel interested in these topics and says I talk boring things only. 

Please advice me on this or hint me what I should be doing? And sorry about the long post.

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, she’s been asking me to talk about something for 4 days since she’s been so frustrated with her family crises. And I don’t know what exactly to talk to her about. She says she talks to me and hopes to relax from all the stress and all but I only add up more to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She keeps asking me to talk about something and if I do, all I can think about is talking about my problems or her problems or complimenting her or talking related to my family and she likes none of those to talk about because my family particularly doesn’t like her so much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I want to ask is, what do I talk to her about when she says, “Talk about something else.” But doesn’t feel interested in these topics and says I talk boring things only. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please advice me on this or hint me what I should be doing? And sorry about the long post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR We [20MF] have nothing to talk about and my gf finds things boring that I talk about and wants me to talk about something else all the time and I don’t know what to really talk to her about. What should I talk about? Give some advice.&lt;/p&gt;

I wasn’t particularly keen on the guy , but he seemed fun and I though I had nothing to lose.
We went to this bar in central London and had a chat . It was an ok date , but I didn’t feel like it. I was polite enough to stay for few hours and talk to the guy . 

Around 10pm I decided that it was time to go home and call it a night. We said our goodbyes and I headed to the nearest tube station . I remember being slightly tipsy and just enjoying listening to music when at the next stop he got on . 

He is very tall , very sporty / athletic looking ,has piercing blue eyes and a dark hair . He definitely got my attention, but I tried not to stare . Girls stare at him a lot when we are out . 😂

I remember I smiled at him , he smiled back , but I never really have my hopes up since London is not a place where people chat you up . Anyway he sat next to me, I instantly felt some crazy energy between us , but I knew my stop was coming so I stood up to get off .

I sensed a tap and there is he asking if I can give him my number. He was quite drunk , so I didn’t know what to make of it . I gave him my number and later on I got a text from him :

Hey nice to meet you I’m so and so . I will text you tomorrow . Have a good night .

I replied back and said goodnight .

The next day he messaged me which was nice . I learnt that he was from New York , but his mum was English, he moved here recently and wanted to start a fresh . New York was too much for him . In a sense I know why he feels that way . When I visited New York I found it hectic and a strange city .

We decided to meet the following week. It was easy since we both work in central London , so it was convenient for both of us .

We met at a bar near Tower Hill.  I was surprised that he was more than a good looking guy . I have met quite few good looking guys , but they were very basic. I felt they relied on their looks not their personality. However he was different, he was funny ( still is ) , he was intelligent and quirky . 

We bounded over love for travelling , video games , history , philosophy. 

It was a real change. We had few drinks ( there went my dry January resolution). We kissed and I went home . 

We went on a second date few days later and since then we have been together.

It’s been 3 years and I still get butterflies when I see him . We live together now and plan to get married next year .

We have gone on multiple days, had sex, talked about personal stuff, and he’s very affectionate. Our conversations are always productive, and we do communicate a lot. I usually see him twice every two weeks

There are a few things I’m concerned about, and I’m not sure where this is going, or he’s just using me for his own convenience or if he’s talking to someone else. Keep in mind that I’m always there for him when he’s depressed and needs someone to talk to and someone who listens. 

I started feeling insecure about things fairly recently, and it’s not because of things I made up in my mind; it’s because of things I have noticed while spending time with him and talking over WhatsApp.

I started feeling like this when we went out on a date this past December to Washington Square Park. I noticed a conversation he was having with another guy. They were calling each other baby and papi and sending each other the kissing emoji. I brought this up to him immediately and demanded an explanation. He told me that’s how he shows affection to friends, and I told him that I find that disrespectful because he’s with me, and he shouldn’t be calling other people like that because it could be easily interpreted. One, I will think he’s talking to other people, and two, since we’re discreet (I’ve only met his family, but he introduced me as a friend, and I haven’t met his friends, and I’d really like to), his friends and acquaintances don’t know abt us, so him calling them like will think he’s available.  We talked abt it, and he agreed to remain using those terms with me only. I told that those terms are special to me, and that should only be used among the two of us.

Few days after, he wanted me to accompany him to the hospital. When he was asked for his social security, he had a picture of it saved on his phone. As he was looking for it on his photo albums, he noticed I was looking and then proceeded to turn around so I wouldn’t see and he smiled. This was the third time he did it, and out of respect, I never asked because I wanted to respect his privacy. He also does this when answering messages from friends and acquaintances; not family members. After leaving the hospital, I brought it up to him, and I asked him why he acts suspicious when answering messages on social media and looking through his photo albums. He told me he has pornography of his friends on his phone saved, but said this was before us, and that he will delete him, which according to him he did after that convo. He began to answer messages of his friends next to me but I saw him deleting convos on WhatsApp. He agreed that things could be misinterpreted, and we talked about it.

I’ve been insisting in meeting his friends and people he hangs out with. He said that he will, but never does. For me, meeting his friends is important, and at times, I feel like he’s hiding me and doesn’t want people to know. For example, today, he was hanging out with his acquaintances at their place because they were having a party. I FaceTimed him exactly at 12am to wish him a happy 2020. We talked for a bit. It was a bit loud inside but he walked out from the apartment so he could hear me better. I asked him to send me kisses over FaceTime multiple times to test something. He was facing the door of the apartment, which was open, and there were people by the door. Every time I asked him he would turn around, having his back facing the door to hide his kisses. I also told him to introduce to his friends right there and then but he didn’t want to. 

A lot of other stuff have happened but these are the major ones. I don’t know what to do or what to think. A friend of mine told me that’s he’s using me for his convenience, for sex, etc without compromising.

There's a really special guy I like, who even invited me to his birthday (his birthday was some days ago idk if u care lol). I told him, that I don't want to go because I don't really like anyone there beside him. When he realized, that I won't come, he invited 3 of my friends (not my besties, just some friends we share) but none of them came. Because I didn't knew, that one of them ain't coming, I went to his birthday.. and it was reallyy weird for me. Later on, when we chatted on WhatsApp I told him that I really tried it because of him and he answered: aww. 

In the winter break we plan to meet up but I'll wait for him to ask me, because I already did twice (he did it once, but when we had a lil fight so it didn't worked out). 2 and a half years ago I confessed my feelings for him, but back then I was 12 and he didn't like me back but in general we just weren't ready for anything serious at this point. I told him in June 2017, but after March 2018 we lost contact, as we started fighting.  After I had been in another relationship and other stuff happened, we got in contact again on our class trip in September 2019.

In october I asked him to meet up and we went to another city, where we had a really great time and we also talked about how sad it was that we lost contact and how nice it is, that we are back at spending time together again. Since 2 weeks we chat very often about different random stuff and nowadays he ain't ignoring my flirt attempts on whatsapp and he even sends the blushing emoji and aww like in the example.

Some other day I told him, that I'm scared to be as annoying as one other girl, who he dislikes, he told me that it's definitely not likely to happen. 

So he isn't really avoiding my flirt attempts and he also always tries to make me feel good about myself, but I don't know if he does this because of love or friendship..

My best friend says I should wait, before I tell him, because if I don't, even if he is developing feelings, he will be confused what to answer. I understand where she's coming from, but I don't want to wait to long, because the longer I'll wait, the more rejection will hurt.

So should I wait, before I tell him and if so, for how long?
And if I shouldn't wait, should I tell him this, the next time we meet up?

My intuition tells me that he might be interested in me but I’m not too sure. I’m definitely developing feelings for him and even dreaming about him a lot. (M&amp;F18)


I apologize for the poor grammar, English is not my mothertongue. 

I’ll start with some background information to explain the situation. Twice a week I go to filmclass, we discuss and learn about film technique. The lessons are on Tuesdays, and on Fridays. On Tuesdays it’s the first lesson of the day, and on Fridays it’s the last lesson of the day and I go home after it. 

Film is my biggest interest and so I chose this class even though I didn’t know anybody there. I just sit quietly, listen to the teacher, mind my own business and then leave quickly whenever class finishes. From the very first lesson, I noticed that the majority of the students who had chosen this class only chose it because it had a rumour of being one of the easier classes, with no real interest of film which kinda disappointed me. Although there was one group of 3 guys who I could tell were clearly interested in the subject. One of those guys in particular caught my eye, I’ll call him Mike. First time I noticed him was on the second lesson of the semester when I came running into the class late and sat almost infront of him, with my back slightly turned to him. I noticed how he was staring at my No Face key ring and how he kept looking at me. I didn’t think much of it at the time and forgot about it since I thought it was irrelevant. 

A month or two later, we’re assigned to hold a presentation on any movie we want. Since I didn’t know any of the students in that class, I was one of the few students who held the presentation alone. I was pretty nervous but it turned out alright. This was on a Friday. When class finished, I went to my locker, got my jacket and started walking out of school while listening to music through my headphones. I could slightly hear somebody walking behind me, and then I heard a voice shouting ”hey! hey you!” multiple times. I didn’t turn around at first, but then I felt a hand on my shoulder and I turned around and saw that it was Mike. He complimented my presentation as we continued walking together, saying that it was great and we even discussed the movie. We walked together and chatted for about one minute, then we reached a crossing and went seperate paths. I felt an immense sense of ”euphoria” (!?) and I was just completely overwhelmed by that interaction. I kept thinking about it nonstop for a couple of days. Since then, he has walked up to me in the same way 3 more times. It’s always the same; me walking away from school, and him running up to me to chat for a bit as we walk. We never talk during class because we never get the chance to, so on Fridays I always look forward to hopefully getting to see him and chat with him. When we walk past each other in school we both smile widely and just quickly say hi. 

I’ve gotten the feeling that he might be interested in me, but I’ve been overthinking it way too much. I asked a male friend, and he said that this is the behaviour of a guy that wants to initiate contact with a girl that he’s interested in. My male friend pointed it out especially since I was wearing headphones on multiple occasions and that Mike still walked up to me. My friend meant that you wouldn’t walk up to somebody from class that’s wearing headphones if you weren’t interested in them, especially since we live in Sweden - a country where no strangers walk up to each other, ever. I want to believe my friend, but I’m not sure. I don’t want to blow a small interaction out of proportion. 

And to be honest, each time me and Mike have talked I’ve been a bit ”off” and I don’t think I’ve shown much interest which I’m scared might drive him away. I just didn’t want to seem too excited to talk to him, even though I was. 

Basically, my intuition is telling me that he might be interested in me and that has driven me completely insane. Thing is, my intuition is usually correct and people that I have felt some kind of vague ”connection” with before have always ended up being valid (an example is that I matched with the guys that I had been having constant eyecontact with from school on tinder). I feel SO drawn to him. My eyes search for him everywhere I go. It’s crazy because if you’d add up the total time of our conversations, it would barely be 5 minutes and I’m not the type at all to feel like this. It’s a bit embarrassing to admit but I’ve even dreamt about him atleast 4-5 times this month. I wouldn’t have a problem with taking the first step and adding him on social media or asking him if he’d want to go to the movies together IF I was more sure that he actually was interested. Am I totally blowing this out of proportion? Do you think that these vague interactions are enough to determine whether or not he’s interested in me? Is it worth to spend this much energy thinking about it?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Guy from my filmclass keeps running up to me after class to have short conversations.

She’s currently unemployed (recently lost her job with my employer) and abuses her body with alcohol and cigarettes. She also smokes weed and occasionally uses psychedelics. She struggles with social anxiety because her mother emotionally abused her, and is deeply depressed because two of her boyfriends died young.

I don’t know what to do.

I have this girl that really loves me, she's very sweet, kind, funny, a bit childish but very loving. I fantasize of making her the happiest girl in the world. 

I love being passionate, I love being romantic and I love being infatuated. I fantasize about sitting next to her inside a cabin, were sitting on the floor. The lights are off with the exception of the chimney fire and some dimmed lights comming from the lamps. The carpet is red, she's leaning next to me, we have a blanket covering us. I'm holding her gently, making her feel wanted, special, safe, and treasured. Cuddling and petting her, I smile and I kiss her, I stare into her eyes and tell her how much I love her. This next part might sound cheesy, but I also want to buy her some expensive chocolate and feed them to her(side note, I've told her this and she laughed 😂)

I also fantasize about taking her out to a fancy restaurant, I would wear an expensive tux with some some accessories and she'd wear a lovely dress and get her hair done. Our hearts skipping beats the moment we see each other, completely and and utterly overwhelmed with desire and passion. The table will have red covering with candles at the table and a bottle of champagne. We would stare at each other intimately while I gently put my glass of champagne on her lips and she does the same, our elbows touching and lips smiling while we wait for the waiter.

This one is more of her fantasy, but I'll include it here since I do desire to make her feel infatuated. I want to have a slow dance with her, but the night has to be perfect. The moon is outside, as big and yellow as can be. It is drizzling and romantic melodies are playing, however, I am holding her, our hearts are beating and the moment overtakes us. I lean in and kiss her neck a couple of time and then her lips, she presses her hands on my chest and I hold her lower back gently.

Some guy recently confessed his feelings to me. I reciprocated them, and then he asked me out for a date. I'm so terrified, and in my fear, I may have had some sort of crisis. 

Now that I've really had some time to myself, I realized that my feelings have started to fade away, and that I kind of lost them. What if I don't actually like this person, and I only like the feeling of falling in love? Have I romanticized relationships to the point where I'm so desperate for someone to love me even though I don't see any future with them?

However, it might be too late because word has spread (thanks to me and my inability to keep my mouth shut for more than one minute) and now everyone is rooting for the both of us. I don't know if I'm ready or not, or if I'll ever be ready, and I don't want to do anything that I might regret in the future.  I also don't want to hurt myself or the other person, and it's kind of pathetic to end something before it even starts because I have cold feet.

We hadn't said 'I love you' yet, but I knew it was a matter of time. I've been ready since the summer but was letting him say it first because I didn't want to pressure him. I didn't mind too much that he hadn't said it because he genuinely showed me he did every day, and we had our own little phrase that I came to learn was his way of saying it, ""You're the best.""

The other week we were talking about his inability to be 100% serious (he used the word sincere) ever. Like even the most sincere moments had to have some tinge of sarcasm to them. He used ""You're the best"" as an example, but didn't explicitly say that he meant it as ily.

So Niagara. We've been on 2 trips before this one. One camping, and the other a trip to New Hampshire and Maine. Niagara was us two, his friend, and her boyfriend.

I'd been telling my friends that if he doesn't say it on this trip, I'd square up (jokingly). Normally it wouldn't bother me where/when it happened but I am a hopeless romantic and our origin story was certainly not a meet cute (tinder) so I wanted one really nice story.

So we're at the falls after an extremely long day. Its dark and raining. We're looking out over the water at the fireworks. He asks me ""So is it everything you wanted?""

I respond, ""There's just one brief moment of sincerity I'm missing,"" with a grin.

We stare at eachother for a moment. He kisses me and pulls apart and says ""I love you"".

I say, ""I love you, too.""

Welp turns out this dumbass has been ready to say it since late August/early September and the only reason he didn't say it on our trip to NH was we were both super stressed cause we got trapped on the mountains, plus he knew I was super excited for Niagara.

The next day at a museum we had this conversation:
Him: so how hard was it to not say?
Me: you'll see soon enough how often I wanna say it, still trying to ease into it for you
Him: I know what I'd unleash when I said it. I'm at a point in my life where I don't throw it around willy nilly, I'm in it for the long haul

The ring my husband proposed to me with was an opal his mom gave him that was waaaayyy too big for my finger and couldn't afford to resize. We purchased our wedding rings off of Ebay for maybe $60 for the set--his and hers.

We busted our asses to do better financially--I continued with school while staying home with our son and my husband continued to become more successful in the automotive industry.

Around our 12th anniversary, my husband had dropped clues that he was going to get me a ring--of course I had shown him the styles that I preferred any time we were in a jewelry store. However, when he finally presented me with his chosen ring on our Anniversary it was nothing like I had shown him... in fact, it was almost the opposite.. I was disappointed but also really really hurt. But I wore it happily for him even though it made me sad. And it made me sad and upsate every day I wore it and saw it on my finger because it felt like he bought this ring without really thinking of me..

Fast forward to now. I had been online ""window shopping"" for rings and shared 5 or so different styles that I loved with my husband. He didn't have much of a response, so I asked him if it bothered him at all that I was looking at rings and he said no--note: some time around 2018 I finally told him that I wasn't very happy with the ring and that I thought he would have picked out something more like what I'd shown him; this lead to a guilt trip. So I ended up buying a ring that I absolutely love about a week ago. A natural opal surrounded by diamonds. It reminded me of when he proposed to me when we literally had nothing and how far we've come. 

So we were out Christmas shopping earlier today, which reminded me of the ring I bought so I tell him about it. He proceeded to get angry with me, took his wedding band off and now won't speak to me. He told me how much I had hurt his feelings since the ring he got me ""wasn't good enough"" and told me to at least give him the other ring back so he could return it. I reminded him that I had told him that the ring he picked wasn't what I liked and that when I asked if he minded that i was looking at other rings he had said no. It was basically at that point that he stopped talking to me and wouldn't even look at me.

So I tell him this and he says he wants to get dinner and drinks regardless. So we make a plan for like 3 days later. Which was tonight. We went to a couple bars I had never been to before and had an amazing time. We then walked down to the boardwalk in our little east cost town where there are hammocks and he finally kissed me. We ended up making out a bit and chatting in between. We mostly spoke about how sad it is that we feel like this could be so great if only I weren’t leaving and his timing wasn’t so bad. We both are on career paths that we know are never going to be stable or in one place. So we walk up to where I have to get my bus home and are making out in the bus stop and he is saying such sweet things to me that I tear up a little. I shit you not this felt surreal. Then the bus comes and we have this dramatic goodbye kiss and now I doubt I’ll see him and again for a long time even though he told me to keep in touch.

All night he is being kinda flirty with me but I guess I’m kinda dim cause I still didn’t think much of it until at the end of the night he say we should totally get drinks some time. To which I was like yeah that would be great, the only problem is (and here is the kicker) I am moving in less than a week half way across the country. So I tell him this and he says he wants to get dinner and drinks regardless. So we make a plan for like 3 days later. Which was tonight. We went to a couple bars I had never been to before and had an amazing time. We then walked down to the boardwalk in our little east cost town where there are hammocks and he finally kissed me. We ended up making out a bit and chatting in between. We mostly spoke about how sad it is that we feel like this could be so great if only I weren’t leaving and his timing wasn’t so bad. We both are on career paths that we know are never going to be stable or in one place. So we walk up to where I have to get my bus home and are making out in the bus stop and he is saying such sweet things to me that I tear up a little. I shit you not this felt surreal. Then the bus comes and we have this dramatic goodbye kiss and now I doubt I’ll see him and again for a long time even though he told me to keep in touch. I know this is not really a question or anything but I just wanted to share because it feels a little crazy right now. Almost like star crossed lovers lol. Anyone else have a crazy story like this?&lt;/p&gt;

He really likes me

Wait

What?

**Here's the story or somethin:**

There was a party at my place and well... He can be a socially anxious dumbo, so he just decided to go for a stroll in an UNKNOWN NEIGHBORHOOD, a GHETTO neighborhood. For the record... He was drunk. Veeeery drunk. 

I run after him (cuz duh, he's walking around and singing ring of fire without a jacket on, it was freezing cold) 

I get to him in time, convince him to go back, only to then take a stroll together with jackets on this time.

We went to a park thingy, and literally just cuddled on an ice cold bench. 

I remember hearing him talk about how he likes me... Like, reeeeally likes me. I then felt his face get way too close for comfort to mine and right after, boom, a kiss. A drunk, bad, sloppy kiss. His first kiss, his first kiss that happened with his crush on an ice cold bench in a ghetto neighborhood.

So yeah, as it turns out, he was head over heels for me for about three weeks at that moment I think. 

And that kiss made me consider all I thought about before... But the question ""do I like him?"", disappeared immediately, I did. I liked this guy who is trying to be an asshole but is just too goddamn nice to people, this guy who is a massive nerd, this guy with jokes so bad they're good, this guy who gives probably the best hugs ever, this guy who can't kiss for shit. This guy right... Goddamn I love how cute he can be. 

He kind of sobered up and we talked a bit about how we couldn't decide anything while laying on a cold bench, drunk, so he'd stay over the day after so we could talk shit out.

When we came back there were people talking about shit. Shit like;""You've focked"" and ""You are SUcH a cOUpLe""

So we ran away again

To kiss and stuff

When one of the dudes left the party he straight up pointed at the guy and said:""You better have s*x tonight""

And well, we didn't, but in the morning we made out and he stayed over for the rest of the day and like

We are now

A couple

We're both still really confused as to how it all happened, but the most important thing is that it's pretty nice","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is sorta kinda an update to my other post thing: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/romance/comments/e277pq/please_say_he_doesnt_like_me/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share""&gt;Please say he doesn&amp;#39;t like me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He really likes me&lt;/p&gt;

I took that as a sign that he didn't like me and moved on.

A year later, we are in the same major and in all the same classes. I swore to myself that I would ignore him at all costs so that crush never came back.... and here's what happened:

\- After class, I was walking down the hall, and he yelled my name. This was a pretty long hallway and he's a shy guy, which all struck me as weird. He came up to me and started talking to me about the upcoming football game... which i found odd since we haven't talked in 8 months. And why did he feel the need to tell me about his weekend plans??

\-In another class, we were randomly paired to be in the same group. During class, we formally got to catch up. We talked for 50 minutes, mostly about his study abroad adventure. He told me in great detail about the friends he made and showed me pictures (even pics of when they had movie nights)... he mentioned that he cried when they all parted ways at the end

\-Two weeks later he tells me about an away football game he went to and mentions that the one friend (who was a girl) that he went with had a boyfriend... like why did he add that detail if it had nothing to do with his story???

\-I missed class and texted him to let me know what happened. he replies by emailing me a giant paragraph and an outline about what happened. keep in mind, no one takes notes in this class ,and in the email, he wrote ""sorry you couldn't come to class, I hope you have a good week""

\-Recently, he was standing outside the computer lab and I had swipe access to let the small group of people standing outside the door in. He watches me walk over and swipe everyone in... and he says "" (my name) saves the day"" and continues to have a conversation with me 

\-Remember how I invited him to a concert? Well, he goes to see this artist this year, 3.5 hours away in a different city. I mention that the artist was at our school last year, and though he told me back then that he couldn't go with me since he was hanging out with his friends watching football, his story now is that he ""really , really wanted to go but couldn't""

We talk a lot, like a LOT, a girl that is also friends with him has told me that he might be interested in me, but umm... I'm a dumbos, is he giving me ""signs"" or am I like, okayish?




**So the things that he does that I think would be considered ""signs"" are:**

- He is always there for me e.g. I feel bad? He's there to give a hug 

- We talk about personal stuff a lot 

- We constantly tease eachother

- ""In case you ever feel down or sad text me okay? Or just text me if you feel like you want to chat or something, yeah""

- Me:* am happy *, him:""Pff"", me:""Whaat?"", him:""That's fucking cute"" (this happens a lot btw)

- So yeah, he calls me cute a lot and often goes ""awww""

- We've hugged so much at a high school trip thing that my shirt literally just smelled like him

- When our class was watching a movie I was trying to find a comfortable position to sleep in, I saw him just kind of shcoot closer to me and move on his chair, until he finally just looked at me and clapped his shoulder, so I slept on his shoulder ;-;

- Recently when I've hugged him, I felt his heart start to beat faster ;-;

- We literally just kinda layed in a dark room and talked for hours on a high school trip which was really chill and nice. I didn't look at him, but I felt his head turn on the pillow to look over at me a few times ;-;

- He leans in a lot when we're talking, a small thing but I can literally feel his like, body temperature thing right next to me ;_;

- Has said a lot of ""*usually* I don't like this, but not with you"" stuff (which sounds so cheesy that I might be lactose intolerant) ;_;

...

Am I an asshole?.. I just... Feel like I can't know for sure if he likes me, unless he tells me. But like... Am asshole for giving ""signs""? Putting my head on his shoulder instead of refusing is probably a ""sign""?..

Am confused 

What is *sign* and what is *friend*?

Am just wanna be friends or something 

Am having a squish but no more than friends 

Am leading him on?

Hjalp


**Update:**

Apparently we're dating now, wow. He has an asexual friend and told me that he recognized a lot of that in me and that's why he held off on making a ""move"". He is also confused himself btw, so we don't know where this is going yet, all we know is that we have *something* and that *something* feels nice","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay so um...

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has said a lot of &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; I don&amp;#39;t like this, but not with you&amp;quot; stuff (which sounds so cheesy that I might be lactose intolerant) ;_;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I an asshole?.. I just... Feel like I can&amp;#39;t know for sure if he likes me, unless he tells me. But like... Am asshole for giving &amp;quot;signs&amp;quot;? Putting my head on his shoulder instead of refusing is probably a &amp;quot;sign&amp;quot;?..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am confused &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;sign&lt;/em&gt; and what is &lt;em&gt;friend&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am just wanna be friends or something &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am having a squish but no more than friends &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am leading him on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hjalp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently we&amp;#39;re dating now, wow. He has an asexual friend and told me that he recognized a lot of that in me and that&amp;#39;s why he held off on making a &amp;quot;move&amp;quot;. He is also confused himself btw, so we don&amp;#39;t know where this is going yet, all we know is that we have &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; and that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; feels nice&lt;/p&gt;

So about 4 months ago I met a girl at my work (I’m a waiter 24m) and we hit it off really well and she kinda claimed me as her best friend. Now I had not been in a relationship in a very long time and everyone that had seen us together told me that she was totally into me. So of course I get excited and we hang out a few times and I ask her out, no biggie right? BIGGIE. She told me she didn’t really feel that way for me and that we should try to be friends. 

   So of course I was like yeah sure absolutely, but classic me I had already fallen for her super hard. But I was still happy to have her as a friend. 

   Fast forward 2 months and we are still pretty cool with each other we are hanging out a little less but now she is really seeming to be into me. Idk if she just is super flirty or what but I was convinced that she had a thing for me. So I kinda eased into asking if she liked me again. Bad idea. Now she’s sure. I spend about a week or two being heartbroken and still having to see her every day at work. 

   After those few weeks she stopped talking to me outside of work, stopped texting me, you know, the works. 

  Fast forward to now. She unfriended me on Snapchat, and I have texted her earlier this morning asking her if she wants to talk it out rather than just blocking each other on social media and having to work together every day in misery. She had not responded or viewed my text.

Idk what to do. I’m pretty sure I still have feelings for her and I’ve never been heartbroken before and idk how to deal with these feelings. 
I really like her as a person and she and I were pretty good friends. 

   I guess what I’m asking for is some advice on how to deal with these feelings and if you think it would be feasible to repair out friendship?

This will probably sound like a movie, so bear with me, cause its actually all true 😂. Ok so i had a crush on this dude, we'll call him elliot. I had a crush on him on and off since sixth grade. In the 7th grade he got a girlfriend, but me and him became friends. In 8th grade, they broke up and we became like best friends. Everyone thought we were dating or should be dating, but we never did. Now theres this other guy right? we'll call him dillan. We were good friends in 6th grade for a month or so but then he started being rude to me. So like all of middle school me and dillan hated each other. We would always fight. However for christmas we had class secret santa, and by amazing chance, i got my crush at the time, elliot, and dillan got me. I thought  nothing of it at the time, but looking back it was ironic. I still had a mega crush on elliot, and he was kinda giving me signs he felt the same. So 8th grade summer comes along. Me and elliot got into a HUGE argument and our friendship kinda ended. Both of my good girl friends, mel and abby dated dillan, abby for like 4 months, mel for like a week. However mel kissed him, abby never did. They were fighting about stuff and abby and mel stopped being friends because of all of the drama involved. At the time honestly i could give a dingos kidney about dillan and  the whole situation. Then freshmen  year started. I guess me and him were just tired of fighting. So we stopped arguing. This was in august this year. In the middle of october, we were both stuck after school (me and dillan, that happens a lot cause both of our moms work at school) and we played a game of never have i ever and truth or dare and stuff with some of the 8th graders. Nothing happened between us, but we both found out more about each other. That night i texted him and said, ""hey that was fun we should do that again sometime."" And he texted me back agreeing. Then we got into a really deep conversation. The next day i didnt really think much of it, but you know, It was interesting cause we hadn't been friends for years. Two days later was my friend emmas birthday party. Dillan is emmas best friend, other than me, so only us two were invited. At the parry, dillan kept pushing down my hat and stuff, saying ""curse of blinding"". Then on the car ride home, i sat in the middle of the two of them, and emma, who has no personal space tried to sleep on my shoulder. I then half leaned on hin shoulder kinda awkwardly cause i didnt know if he'd take it weird, cause its not like i had a crush on him. but for some reason i really wanted to grab his hand. He took of my hat to make me more comfortable on his shoulder, and then I went from just kinda resting on the end of his shoulder to actualy resting in the crevice of his neck. His hand was on my knee and he rested his chin on my head, and it was weird and different but i just enjoyed it and relaxed and so did he. Then later that night right after i got home he texted me and long story short he told me he was starting to like me. We decided to just be friends andd figure this out. He agreed that it was all really impulsive and stuff. Then on halloween me and emma went over to his house. We were just fooling around and i sat down in this little closet thing under a blanket. He came into the closet and emma Shut the door and we started fooling around locking her out. Then she dissapeared and we just sat awkwardly in the closet staring at each other. Then his MOM came in the room and emma was like,""theyre in the closet"". So yeah. Ans then recently its weird cause like he'll stand close to me an let me hug him and play with his hair and stuff and if i wear a hat he'll do the curse of blinding thing i told you about , and were going to banquet (private school equivalent of a dance ) together as friends, but i dont know if he still has feelings for me. The  thing now is that i have feelings for  him. And oh i forgot. EMMA likes him too. And this girl a grade up. And the girl a grade up is tryna compete with me for him. So like i like him now but i dont know if he feels the same. So. WHAT SHOULD I DO REDDIT.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok storytime from a 14(f). This will probably sound like a movie, so bear with me, cause its actually all true 😂. Ok so i had a crush on this dude, we&amp;#39;ll call him elliot. I had a crush on him on and off since sixth grade. In the 7th grade he got a girlfriend, but me and him became friends. In 8th grade, they broke up and we became like best friends. Everyone thought we were dating or should be dating, but we never did. Now theres this other guy right? we&amp;#39;ll call him dillan. We were good friends in 6th grade for a month or so but then he started being rude to me. So like all of middle school me and dillan hated each other. We would always fight. However for christmas we had class secret santa, and by amazing chance, i got my crush at the time, elliot, and dillan got me. I thought  nothing of it at the time, but looking back it was ironic. I still had a mega crush on elliot, and he was kinda giving me signs he felt the same. So 8th grade summer comes along. Me and elliot got into a HUGE argument and our friendship kinda ended. Both of my good girl friends, mel and abby dated dillan, abby for like 4 months, mel for like a week. However mel kissed him, abby never did. They were fighting about stuff and abby and mel stopped being friends because of all of the drama involved. At the time honestly i could give a dingos kidney about dillan and  the whole situation. Then freshmen  year started. I guess me and him were just tired of fighting. So we stopped arguing. This was in august this year. In the middle of october, we were both stuck after school (me and dillan, that happens a lot cause both of our moms work at school) and we played a game of never have i ever and truth or dare and stuff with some of the 8th graders. Nothing happened between us, but we both found out more about each other. That night i texted him and said, &amp;quot;hey that was fun we should do that again sometime.&amp;quot; And he texted me back agreeing. Then we got into a really deep conversation. The next day i didnt really think much of it, but you know, It was interesting cause we hadn&amp;#39;t been friends for years. Two days later was my friend emmas birthday party. Dillan is emmas best friend, other than me, so only us two were invited. At the parry, dillan kept pushing down my hat and stuff, saying &amp;quot;curse of blinding&amp;quot;. Then on the car ride home, i sat in the middle of the two of them, and emma, who has no personal space tried to sleep on my shoulder. I then half leaned on hin shoulder kinda awkwardly cause i didnt know if he&amp;#39;d take it weird, cause its not like i had a crush on him. but for some reason i really wanted to grab his hand. He took of my hat to make me more comfortable on his shoulder, and then I went from just kinda resting on the end of his shoulder to actualy resting in the crevice of his neck. His hand was on my knee and he rested his chin on my head, and it was weird and different but i just enjoyed it and relaxed and so did he. Then later that night right after i got home he texted me and long story short he told me he was starting to like me. We decided to just be friends andd figure this out. He agreed that it was all really impulsive and stuff. Then on halloween me and emma went over to his house. We were just fooling around and i sat down in this little closet thing under a blanket. He came into the closet and emma Shut the door and we started fooling around locking her out. Then she dissapeared and we just sat awkwardly in the closet staring at each other. Then his MOM came in the room and emma was like,&amp;quot;theyre in the closet&amp;quot;. So yeah. Ans then recently its weird cause like he&amp;#39;ll stand close to me an let me hug him and play with his hair and stuff and if i wear a hat he&amp;#39;ll do the curse of blinding thing i told you about , and were going to banquet (private school equivalent of a dance ) together as friends, but i dont know if he still has feelings for me. The  thing now is that i have feelings for  him. And oh i forgot. EMMA likes him too. And this girl a grade up. And the girl a grade up is tryna compete with me for him.

This is on mobile and may be a bit heavy, so please bear with me.

Well, to begin with, I am confused with my sexuality. I think I am not straight, but I am not sure, and the confusion is very unsettling to be. I literally only stop it from troubling me by not thinking about it, which I am aware is a healthy way to approach it. At times, I feel like I am gay, and at other times I feel like I am bi, and sometimes I feel like I am a weird straight teenager who has an unhealthy habit of being attracted to **ahem** 'fun time videos' involving only guys. So, in short, I am quite confused.

The main reason that I am posting is to ask about a recent experience that I had a few days ago. I was standing behind my team member in the lab and I had a sudden urge to kiss him. Like, a full-on liplock. I had to make myself walk away from him and tell myself to focus back on our lab work.

The problem is, I am a very typical studious person. I have never been in a romantic/sexual relationship, and I just like to adore romance from a distance by looking at romance Webtoons and the like. In addition, I hate lip-to-lip kisses, and I think they are gross, which is why I am very confused as to why I experienced a strong urge to kiss.

Now, coming to my questions:

1. What am I to make of this feeling? Is it just hormones or something more?
2. What effect does this have on what I perceive to be my sexuality?
3. Should I turn out to be not straight and something else, how do I accept myself for who I am and not leave this in the closet?

When the stories come to light it always seems easy to say ""why bring it up now and not then?""

This story is about sexual assault.

My girlfriend lived with me for part of the summer three years ago. I lived with three other flatmates. Two boys (boy a and boy b) who I went to school and college with who I have known for the almost 12 years, and another guy (boy c) who I had met through boy A.

Three summers ago, we were all partying and having fun. One of my housemates was particularly in the partying mood. One day whilst I was at work boy A got into my bed whilst my girlfriend was sleeping, she awoke to him in our bed and they spoke about his night out. She told him she was gonna go back to sleep. She then awoke to him cuddling her and his hand up her pajama top and around her bare breast. She froze and panicked. She managed to get herself out of the situation before it got worse.

After that he went to his room and they never spoke about it.

She told me when I got home from work. I didn't say anything to him. I was scared I didn't know what to do.

Boy A did not only do what was said above but he and boy C accused her of trying to sleep with boy C. She confronted them and they admitted that they had speculated it and twisted her words (she made a bad joke.) Boy C admitted that he thought my girlfriend fancied him, ( we had been together for 4 years at this point.)

My girlfriend suffers from PTSD, about a month ago after a night out and an encounter with a creepy stranger ( I was in a queue for a gig t-shirt) she had a flashback of the night. We started to argue and she said "" it's your fault you left me with a stranger at a gig!, Just like you left me with your friend(boy A).""

Since that night we have been arguing over what to do. She feels that because of the way he has treated her; secually assaulting her, accusing her trying to sleep with our housemate, constantly leaving her out of plans that involve all our friends, when she had no where live over the summer he refused to let her live with us, she feels likes he's now trying to push her out, she's done with him. She's blocked him on every platform. She wants me to do the same. That he abused my trust as well and our friendship. I said that if I asked him about it and he accepted it and apologised I could forgive him.

My girlfriend asked if she were to kiss another man would I forgive her I said no I wouldn't, that is different. Although in all honesty she had a male friend who kissed her and when she told me I told her she couldn't see him anymore. To this day she hasn't.

In any case I spoke to my friend recently and asked him he said "" well I don't remember doing it but if I did I'm sorry I don't remember much from that night as I was f***ed on drugs and alcohol, but I am sorry""

To me he sounded sorry and I forgive him. But I told him I needed my girlfriend to make amends before we can get back to normal.

I think forgiving him completely will have a massive impact on our relationship.

I don't think my girlfriend will ever make amends with him. But what does that mean for me and boy A?

I just don't know what to do.

Should I abandon years of friendship? Should I let go of the 7 year relationship?

Am I wrong for wanting that friendship?

If I lose friendship with boy A I could lose friendship with boy B and alot of other mutual friends.

But I love my girlfriend.

You’re the one I love the most. No matter how far apart we are, you’re the first thing that comes into my mind when I wake up or when I go to sleep. We may be far apart due to distance but no matter what, my heart and soul is always with you. I miss you wholeheartedly, all I really want right now is fro you to send me a simple message. I want you to tell me how much you miss me. Wherever you are right now, I hope you’re thinking of me too. No matter what happens I will always be thinking about you.

I love to daydream, but whenever I daydream you’re the one thing that appears in all of them. I love to dream that one day this distance is no longer in our way, I dream of all the greatest possibilities we can do as a couple, we’d hold hands, kiss, and cuddle. And when night comes we’d make love, letting our desires wash over us. We’ll have jobs; I will be working as a social worker and you work as a doctor, together we’d be living in a nice and big apartment and in our apartment we’d cook, clean, and play video games on our PlayStation all day.

And in 8 years we’d marry and throw a ceremony we’ll say our vows as our friends and family smiles and cry’s it’s joy. On our honeymoon we’ll be staying in a tropical island and every night we’ll be making love and cuddle after that. Soon enough we’ll be having children and we’ll love them regardless. Together we’d raise our children and teach them life lessons, we’d watch them grow up and together we’ll grow old together in a small cabin and reunite in the afterlife. And if we ever get the chance to live again I’d fall for you all over again","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;10/17/19&lt;/p&gt;

To start, id just like to say I am so incredibly lucky to not only have such an open-minded, supportive, sweet, and caring boyfriend ever, but to have gotten with him so soon without feelings of rejection and fear.

I have known my partner for a few years now, either 2 or 3. When I first met him, it was because of my abusive ex. He and my partner, who I will call C from now on, were very close friends and always hung out. I was going off and on with my ex (I'll call him M) for weeks, it was just a sex thing for me and I will admit I hurt him a lot because of this. However, his reaction was a huge red flag for who he is. He took personal texts that I sent him and made it look like I was obsessed with him and that he was a cold badass, meanwhile, it was usually the other way. I would tell him I didn't want anything serious, and he would beg for a relationship and treat me like shit. He made himself look amazing in these youtube videos he showed his friends and made me look insane. Anyway, in these videos, he called me Purple Skittlez because at the time he first met me I had purple hair.C heard about this from M and started to call me purple skittlez obnoxiously.

 I will admit, he was very annoying in the first two years I knew him. After that, I sorta lost contact as I was isolated by M from everyone. In August, specifically, August 29, I met C personally for the first time. I remember it so clearly. I walked in and saw him sitting there next to my old friend since 4th grade. I sat down next to him and said hi. It felt like an immediate connection between us like we were already together. It was a spark of electricity. I've never laughed so hard in my life that day. 

After that, we went out to lunch and we arranged to meet up with a large group of friends at a football game the next day.So Friday, august 30th roles around and I am freaking out nervous. I knew I was crushin' hard and I wanted something to happen that night. I put on my best makeup and felt like such a cutie when I rolled up to the football game. He and I met with our friend, who I'll call R at Dunkin and waited for another friend to meet up with us. I was sweating bullets while sitting across from him, and I just stared at him in awe. So the football game starts and we go to get the ticket to get in and they say ""Oh a couple, have fun"" and I'm sure I turned bright red cause he laughed when he looked at my face. 

For pretext, that friend that we were waiting for knew I was interested in C and told him ""Yeah, \[my name\] is going to flirt with you cause she wants to fuck you"" which wasn't true at the time, I just wanted to be with him. So, he already knew and was flirting back, he's even told me if she hadn't told him that he wouldn't have come off as strongly as he did.So basically, we go into a dugout with our friends and us just hangout playing music, he went to go do pullups on a bar so he gave me his hat (that I still have to this day). We eventually go into the grass and he took off his hoodie, so I took it and put it on. (TMI but lemme just say when I smelled his scent I got so fucking high it was like I snorted coke.) We were flirting pretty fucking hard, but the girl who told him also was interested in him and was trying to compete with me. 

For example, he asked who wanted to be cuddle buddies and I said yes... but so did she. So we joked and said it was a threesome cuddle. We were just very close immediately.Now, R was single at the time and dealing with a breakup. He was pretty jealous of C and me, so he, C, the other girl (A) and I all walked over to R's house with his younger sister so he could get some stuff and cry. While we waited outside C just randomly comes out with ""who doesn't want to be single this year?"" C, A, and I all raised our hands. He jokingly said ""hmm this is hard"" and A immediately put her hand down, he told me he only said that cause he knew she'd back out, and that he would've chosen me no matter what. He asked if I was serious and I nervously said yes.

 We held hands walking back to the game and we cuddled on the bleachers for the rest. He was so sweet and cute that night I'm smiling so hard remembering it.there's so much more that's happened since then, and I'm so incredibly grateful that I got together with him so quickly, unlike some people who wait years to get with their partner, if it even happens at all. We have both said if we didn't get together that night it would've happened the following week, as we both had a strong attraction to each other from the get-go.

In this Pandora’s box she bangs against the walls, hoping to get free. My dark passenger. Most of time I’m able to forget she exists, and have that kitchen drawer locked up tight. But sometimes she slips through each nook the cranny, pushing me to let her out. 

It’s a life long struggle. Is it because I’ve been with my husband since we were teens? And haven’t had many sexual partners? but I’m sexually adventurous, much more so than my husband. I like to play. And he does too. But his limits are nowhere near my limits. It’s not enough. He abides the toys we play with, he loves it when he bottoms out from anal, he loves it when I squirt all over him. But those are regular games, normal games. I want to play the big boy games.

I want to fuck, and be fucked. I want to be tied up, blindfolded, tossed up like a thanksgiving turkey, ripe
For the taking. I want to dance like we fuck, sometimes fast, sometimes slow. I want to let go and not think. I want to be told what to do, whether it’s to make myself come while you watch, or make you come with just my tongue. I want to play games, meet in a bar and pretend we don’t know each other, nor the way you taste. Kiss a stranger while you watch, brooding. I want to have a quickie in the bathroom, maybe with more than one partner. I’m a greedy lover after all. I want to feel everything at once.  I want my ass to be red from your slaps while we fuck, my hands tied behind my back, while other people watch. I want so much more than what we’re doing. But most of all, I want to destroy you. I want to push you to the edge and watch you fall apart.  I want you to break, while I feast on your blood. (Metaphorically, not literally 😉)I want to do that and so much more...

But he won’t hear any of it. So my dark desires stay locked up tight. In Pandora’s box. Never to see the light of day.

Is it normal? Is this what’s is like after 15 years together, suppressing all of these desires? He won’t ever budge, or try anything else. No bdsm, no role play, no spontaneous games. So it’s a moot point. The sex is fantastic, I’m not complaining about that, but I’m not Sure it’s because I’m uninhibited and my body is able to come every few minutes, or because of him. We don’t have children yet but will soon.

For the taking. I want to dance like we fuck, sometimes fast, sometimes slow. I want to let go and not think. I want to be told what to do, whether it’s to make myself come while you watch, or make you come with just my tongue. I want to play games, meet in a bar and pretend we don’t know each other, nor the way you taste. Kiss a stranger while you watch, brooding. I want to have a quickie in the bathroom, maybe with more than one partner. I’m a greedy lover after all. I want to feel everything at once.  I want my ass to be red from your slaps while we fuck, my hands tied behind my back, while other people watch. I want so much more than what we’re doing. But most of all, I want to destroy you. I want to push you to the edge and watch you fall apart.  I want you to break, while I feast on your blood. (Metaphorically, not literally 😉)I want to do that and so much more...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he won’t hear any of it. So my dark desires stay locked up tight. In Pandora’s box. Never to see the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it normal? Is this what’s is like after 15 years together, suppressing all of these desires? He won’t ever budge, or try anything else. No bdsm, no role play, no spontaneous games. So it’s a moot point. The sex is fantastic, I’m not complaining about that, but I’m not Sure it’s because I’m uninhibited and my body is able to come every few minutes, or because of him. We don’t have children yet but will soon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any others like me? If so, would really love to hear how you deal.&lt;/p&gt;

So I met this girl in a workshop event about career planning. We sat next to each other because it was our assigned seat. In a free time, we talked quite a bit about each of our career plans and a bit about our past. It was a good talk.

So a week after the event, just now in fact, I messaged her and it went like this:

(This is a translated convo)

Me: ""Hey, you like cats and ice cream?""

Her: ""Hmm, yeah. What is this about?""

Me: ""I kinda want to go to this cat cafe. Maybe you want to join [me]?""

*Silence for 20 minutes*

Her: ""Ohh. Hmm. I want to.. But too bad.. My parents don't allow me to interact with cats..""

Me: ""Ahh haha okay then.""

Her: ""umm, I'm so sorry. Maybe you can ask your other friend to go with you.. :)""

Me: ""Haha it's alright, relax 😁""

Her: ""Okay then..""

So, it's not a hard no.

At first I want to check this cat cafe out on my own but then I thought I could invite her and kill two birds with one stone, get to talk to her more and be close friends or whatever. I'm kinda interested in this girl as she's real fun to talk to, just to clarify.

Also, this is the first time I asked a girl out in a long time and I've never been in a relationship in my whole life.

Should I keep trying to get close to her and invite her to other places later or should I just let it go? I don't want to come off as annoying or creepy.

I'm 22 yo and, in my country, it's common for people my age to still live with their parents.

Hope you all have been well. 

It’s been a while since I’ve posted something, sorry about that. Sadly, this update is anything but happy. Let’s dive right in. 

A few weeks ago, I had a conversation with one of my friends, we’ll call her Neptune, about Mars. She had been telling me about her boy problems and how she didn’t know which boy she liked more between two guys she had been seeing. I felt like I should share my predicament with my crush with her since she spilled so much info out to me. Mind you, Neptune and I are not that close. We’re close by association but we don’t really hang out usually. Anyway, I told her about him, showed her a picture and she was like, “Oh, yeah I think I’ve seen him around! He’s cute, you should go for it!” I didn’t really think much this conversation at the time and forgot about it quite frankly.  

Fast forward to last week and I see one of my close friends, let’s call him Orion (I’m running out of planets), and he tells me that he’s been seeing Neptune and Mars hang out a lot as of late. At first I was shocked. I couldn’t believe she would make a move knowing that I liked him. After thinking it over for a few hours, I though, “maybe it’s not like that for him.” He often hangs out with girls one on one and it doesn’t mean anything, so I shrugged it off. But the actions speak multitudes. 

I decided to go out this weekend and watch him play a game. She wasn’t there and I was a little bit excited. Afterwards we went and got a bite to eat with a group of friends and everything was going well, he was engaging with me, different than before, but it was still something so I was thankful. I asked him and some of my other guy friends if they wanted to hang out later and he didn’t really say anything so I figured he needed a nap. I took a nap too and then went with the same group of people to go watch a movie. I tried to ask him to come with us because I decided that no matter which way it went for me, I was going to tell him that I liked him. RIP me. 🤦🏻‍♀️ 

He was nowhere to be found so we all just hung out and then crashed for the day. The next day was our school’s fall festival and I was curious to go because I wanted to see if it was all it was hyped up to be. Mind you, it crossed my mind that they might show up together, but I was hoping that didn’t happen. God must’ve know I would’ve been crushed if I saw them. My friend asked me for help with something and I got distracted and missed the fall festival. Turns out, Mars and Neptune were there and apparently they were the talk of the night. Sigh. 

I know it’s my own fault because I didn’t make a move, but at the same time, I don’t even know if that would’ve made a difference. I will always hold out hope for the possibility of Mars and I dating. I’ve liked him for so long, he has qualities that I see as husband material. He checks off almost every box on a list I didn’t even know I had. I know he doesn’t feel the same, so for now I’m taking a step back. I don’t think I can even get tutoring from him anymore, it’ll just remind me of the magnitude of the person that I let slip through my fingers. If nothing ever comes from our friendship, he will always be the one who got away. 😔 

I realize that he is not the end of the world and that my story is most certainly not finished. Nonetheless, I am pausing this part of my life to grieve the loss of what could have been. It hurts a lot, but it won’t break me. I am strong and resilient and I will get over it. I decided I’m not going to hang out with him or any of our mutual friends for the remainder of the time before Christmas break. I just can’t handle another sad thing happening in my life. BUT DO NOT FEAR! I’ll be back next year (or before depending on what happens) with more TEA to be spilled ☕️.

Thanks for being my listeners and friends, 

I appreciate all of you. And I’ll return, I promise.

What is my love for you?

It’s not something I can easily explain. I’ve used the flowers as a metaphor but still even then it does not accurately depict what I feel. This love I hold for you is one of simplicity and purity, one that comes without effort. With it comes a child like innocence, for when I’m with you I nearly forget about the rest of the world. This love is something I know won’t die, for its not a fleeting feeling. Its one that is constant, and given the chance this feeling could grow into something truly beyond my own comprehension. Yet is this what true love can be? Are these feelings fabricated out of nothing, or are they rooted in something deeper that has not rose to the surface yet. These are what go through my mind when I get lost in your stare, the eyes are truly the most powerful thing a person can have. They show your intention and feeling even when you are unsure how you truly feel. The eyes are the windows to the soul and I’ve never seen eyes like yours. You’ve said you don’t feel the same, you love me as a friend and as a person, but the way you look back says so much more. I feel as if I should give up hope, yet something in me begs to hold on. You are such a rational and understanding person and I’m lucky to be with you in this regard, I long for more but am able to find solace in where we are now. For I can spend hours with you, just listening and talking, your company is one I never want to lose. Part of me feels you are my soulmate, but how can one feel like that and not the other. Is it dormant? Something that may awaken in time? I feel that answer will come after the London, there are answers there that will change whatever is between us for better or for worse. All I truly want is you happy, and if this is what it takes then continuing down this path I will. The path will change in January.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is my love for you?&lt;/p&gt;

We see stories and movies and fairy tails that show characters falling in love in a variety of different ways. Some couples expected, some unexpected. Some of us want a happy ever after with somebody and try to find ‘the one’ to spend the rest of our lives with, but some of us fear it. Love is scary, it’s an adventure, it’s painful, it’s confusing, but most of all it’s a story. Everybody has a story, then when you fall in love with another person they become part of your story, apart of you. They can change the stories plot, ending, climax, etc. However, even the best relationships have a conflict in their story. Lucky for us though, a story has a climax which solves the conflict. Solving the conflict can change things for the better or for the worse. It can end relationships, fix relationships, improve relationships, or start relationships. It’s scary not knowing what’s going to happen. Once you start a story with somebody you are on the edge of your seat to see what happens and hope you achieve the ending you dream to have. It can be hard, some harder than others. Just because it’s hard it doesn’t mean you should give up. A challenge is good sometimes. It’s a scary challenge though. You soon realize that you would do anything and everything for a person. That somebody who may not have even been in your life for years, can one day enter your life and then you can’t go a day without them. You don’t want anything bad to happen to them, because they become a part of you that you cherish and hold onto as long as you can. You don’t want that taken away from you or anything happening to it. Then it can get harder, especially when your scared to face your fears. When your in love you fear getting hurt or hurting somebody else. You have to make tough decisions, and sometimes we make the wrong ones and it hurts. Certain decisions let you go back, however others don’t. They stick with you for the rest of your life. One decision can ruin a relationship, fix a relationship, or start a relationship. Loves not a game, you don’t want to be played with. You don’t play with somebody when your in love, it’s not a game so don’t treat it like it is.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see stories and movies and fairy tails that show characters falling in love in a variety of different ways.

HAPPY SUNDAY ☀️ 

Okay, thank God I’m feeling better this weekend. I’ve had the chance to think and ponder my situation and I think I’ve come to a decision, but let me update you first. 

Last week I was super discouraged because I thought that Mars would never like me or even see me as more than a sister. Also, I was certain that Pluto was catching feelings for me, so I was scared that that would make Mars not want to see me romantically. Well, after talking it over with Mars’ best friend that happens to be one of my best friends, Jupiter, I realized I was way too paranoid and I needed to get out of my own head. And so I did. 

I am a Christian and I really believe that God listens to me. Sometimes His answers aren’t what I would want, but I know they’re for my good. That being said, I decided that I would test God a little bit. I prayed with my girlfriends for a sign on whether or not I should back off. I told God that if Mars texted me back before I woke up, I would shoot mud shot this week. If Mars texted me after I woke up, I would shoot my shot before the semester was over. If he didn’t text me at all (I had been waiting for a response since Tuesday last week) then I would move on. 

I was really nervous because I really didn’t think that he would text me at all. The next morning I woke up and checked my phone. No text. I was crushed. I told God that it made me sad but if He saw it in His will to give me a chance with this boy, I would appreciate it. Anyway, I got up and started getting ready. After I showered, I started fixing my hair. ALL OF A SUDDEN MY PHONE BUZZED AND I SAW FIVE MESSAGES FROM MARS. FIVE! I’m geeking, but I am taking that as a sign that I gotta shoot my shot soon. 

That’s the story. I’m shooting my shot. I might get curved. I might not. I’m super nervous and stressed but hopefully it will all work out. I’ll keep you posted regardless.

Hope you are having a romantic time :)

I'll jump straight into it. I have been singing/working at a place for about 3 years. There is a girl there (I'll call her Samantha) who has been there for about 2 and I have developed a uh... pretty serious crush. I really enjoy being around her and talking to her gives me little pangs of happiness and in the glorious moments where we make eye contact it's like I'm a pathetic little schoolboy again.The routine of the place is always the same- and when she is there I always try to start a small conversation with her. We always seem to leave work at the same time and we have a nice little chat, I'll try to make an effort to talk to her, and she seems to laugh or chuckle at my dumb jokes (at least I think she does, I'm not sure if she's just being polite). But really, that's all it is. It never goes beyond the small talk...

And here is where it gets difficult.

Because of the place that we work at it would be weird if I asked her out there. When we leave to the train station I could ask her as we part ways to different platforms, but I guess it seems a bit rushy at a train station and I've never worked up the courage to ask her. I have thought about waiting at the same platform she is at to just extend the conversation- but my head tells me that is a little creepy.

It has got to the point where I have every reason to leave that job. The only reason I don't is because I might get to see Samantha, even thought the actually work is boring and I hate it, and there are some times that she isn't there.

She never really seems to be on messenger so sending a facebook message isn't really an option.

Advice anyone? How do I ask Samantha out? I haven't properly done this for 9 years.

On another note, Pluto and I have gotten very close very fast. He is so sweet and gives me the kindest and sweetest attention I’ve ever gotten. I don’t have feelings for him and I don’t think he has feelings for me, but I love the way he treats me. I wish Mars treated me like that...

Anyhow, I have a tutoring session with Mars tomorrow and I’m going to attempt to look very cute and act very cute so that maybe he can take a second look and be like, “hmm, she’s pretty alright.” 

Well, that’s all the updates I have for now. If anything happens tomorrow, I will let all of you know. And if you have any advice, please comment. I would love to hear your thoughts.

But when it comes to my friend group, all my friends have had or been in relationships. I've always been the guy that people come to when they want to talk and honestly, it was nice to be there for me through the greatest times and worst times.  I slept over at my best friend's house for 3 days because he was depressed about his first breakup. That was a heart-melting experience for me because what I saw him do or at least try to do to himself. As I write this, it takes me back to those moments and I feel now what I felt then. 

Now, as a freshman in college and being away from home, I want to put my self out there. However, as of lately it's been no luck. I know it is only the beginning of the semester still and I still my whole life ahead of me but sometimes when I sit down at my computer or do my homework I get lost in time. My emotions take over and being 18 and young, it feels like the world is ending sometimes. Today Sunday, September 29, 2019, was the longest day of my life. My roommate's girlfriend left this morning to go back to their home state and it hit me. I spent the day with them yesterday because they invited me and being in the car with them made me kinda sad. Seeing my roommate goes from College Student to this childish man made me think he has got what he is looking for. 

I think to myself, I want that but I know it will take time. I am a firm believer in things happening for a reason and that good things come to those who wait but sometimes waiting is a torture in itself. Time doesn't seem to be moving at all and I am sitting in my office chair lost in a desolate mirage of reality. For some reason, this feeling hit me like a truck today. It hit me harder than it ever has. In the past, I've understood that I am young and a whole life ahead of me. I have been able to shrug it off and stay positive in the past but today is different. I am not ready to go to sleep and take on another week of school. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, for now, I am writing to let my emotions go, let my tears type the thoughts I have held on for years. An end will come one day and I hope to have a ""fairytale"" ending but for now, I am stuck in my own thoughts and place. Tomorrow will come and I hope to breakthrough another period of this feeling. Time will pass and I know that I will find my true love. The ocean is a large place and sometimes we can get lost along the way. Sometimes I say to myself, in order to find where you are, you need to get lost. Who knows what you and I will find but I hope the best for everyone.

I know it’s been a minute and I apologize. I’ve been trying my best to live in the moment and just experience life, especially with Mars. 

Over the past few weeks, Mars and I have been texting pretty much every day and he’s been tutoring me and honestly, I thought things were going pretty great. We went to a concert together and had a blast, it was the highlight of my year. For a minute there I even thought he might like me... but as always I was wrong. 

Mar’s roommate, let’s call him Pluto, and I are super good friends. The other day we were on the phone and he tells me that Mars is interested in this other girl called Saturn. That really threw me because I really thought things were going super great. After Pluto told me about that, I realized that I’d unintentionally worked my way past the friend zone and into the worst zone of all time: the BRO ZONE. 

I’m doomed I know, but the helpless romantic in me still holds out hope. I texted Mars two days ago and told him I thought he was super cool and cute and he still hasn’t even responded. I’m really not even sure how to interact with him anymore guys, but I’m going to try my best to be cute and casual. 

The moral of the story is: don’t get bro zoned, especially on a bad week. My anxiety has been tweaking and I’ve literally had three existential crises over the past week. It’s fine though, I’m gonna bounce back and even if it doesn’t work out, at least I’ll have cool fail story to tell... right??

I've been talking to this guy for about two months on Whatsapp. Since we started talking, it was pretty clear that we were into each other and decided to have a conversation about our feelings. We agreed to explore it and see where it would take us. We have long conversations throughout the day. Some of our conversations consisted of our personalities, school, work, things we like and don't like, intellectual conversations, and sexual ones (quite a few times) etc. He says that he's really into me, and I reciprocate that same feeling. Here's the thing, we haven't met in person yet, and we plan to but given that I am a monogamous person, I would like to have a conversation about being exclusive the first time we meet or at least, about how uncomfortable it makes me feel when the person I'm talking to is talking to multiple people. To me, that's disrespectful, and I wouldn't want to waste my energy and time if he is considering other romantic or sexual partners. In other words, I would feel led on. Would you have this conversation the first time you meet in person, or wait a little? Why, or why not? Please take into consideration my situation. 

When we first started talking, I did not think about this as much until a particular conversation we had over whatsapp. This is how the conversation went:

I said, ""Don't you have work today?"" (Forgot it was a Saturday)

He said, ""No, lol. Are you sure you're in the right chat?""

I said, ""Yes, and lol, I thought you did.

He said, ""I don't work today. And lol, you're probably talking to another dude""

I said, ""Hmm, no, I'm only interested in you.""

He said, ""I like that, but I wouldn't want to limit you the freedom of getting to know other people you might be interested in."" 

To me, this doesn't mean that he might be talking to other people, but it implies the idea that he's okay with it and probably thinks it's okay to do that, when I'm not. Mind you, this conversation took place about two weeks ago.

I feel like these people have been part of my life for so long that it's as natural to be around them as it is my own sister. While we do share some interests, I believe our friendship is based more on having similar personalities and attitudes towards how we go about life. The three of us are very much cut from the same cloth in that sense. I can typically always relate with the things they're feeling because if I were in their shoes I imagine myself reacting a similar way.

But still despite us all being twenty-five years old, when they turn to me and say they have a boyfriend it's like this wall goes up that I can't see behind. I always wonder ""how did that happen?"" What in your interactions with someone causes you to want to enter into a partnership arrangement? What is the incentive? Similarly, when I am being pursued by someone with intentions for a partnership agreement I struggle to understand what it is they want from me or see in me that is making them act like this. I have never been friends with these people. In fact, our interactions had always been pretty minimal prior to the actual courtship process. Do they think I am pretty? Do they think I say interesting things? Do they want to have sex with me? Do I have certain life resume that make me a good candidate for marriage? Do I remind them of their mother?

Everyone I knew in college would spend time scrolling through Tinder just as they would scroll through Twitter, an endless search for... what, exactly? For some I can see why a romantic partnership would make sense, usually if it is in line with their goals. I know some people who want nothing more than to get married, have kids, and buy a very specific type of house. Finding romantic chemistry with someone is pretty pivotal for that happening. But for many more people I'm left to assume that they're on some sort of autopilot: the only life outline they've been shown is one where a romantic partner becomes one's primary relationship or maybe they meet someone who makes them feel fuzzy and they think ""why not?"" 

For me not only am I seemingly not attracted to people but none of my life goals require an emotional partnership. If anything, an emotional partnership would just make being truly happy in achieving my life goals more difficult. I simply don't understand what makes a partnership so appealing or rather... I don't understand why there isn't more of a diversity in preference. Maybe if one third of people I meet in life found partnership to be the most appealing relationship arrangement whereas another third instead thrived contributing to communities and another third just liked the best to coast by themselves. That array makes sense to me. But it's not like that.

Of last minute preparations, she was the fucking queen. Pushing with irregular kicks a big stool to sit on, and a small one to rest her feet on, she proceeded to her small but cozy L-shaped balcony. The sun was a welcome friend to beat the winter nip.

With her back to the wall adjacent to her door, she comfortably positioned herself, and picked up the first chapter, ten pages roughly torn from a spiral binding, held together firmly by two staple pins. One could read Plato only for so long, she looked up to scan her eyes through the houses of the society facing hers. Clothes drying outside balconies, children playing, women talking across balconies, nothing caught her eye. She tried to bring her focus back to wise old Plato. Abruptly disturbing her short spanned focus came her mother into the balcony with a glass of buttermilk, her favorite afternoon drink. She drank, as her mother proceeded to hang clothes to dry.

She began looking at the houses, and a peculiar potted plant caught her eye, it looked vaguely familiar, yet odd. She asked her mother about it, who did not seem to be able to place it.

She continued to study till the sun was out, after which she went inside and nothing interesting happened to her till the next evening.

Next evening, she went outside to accompany her mother who was out drying clothes, an everyday feature, when the peculiar potted plant was made very interesting by the man behind it, watering it. Fair, bearded, penetrating eyes and an uncanny, mysterious handsomeness. He was the kind of man your mother warns you against. It began raining soon after, and she went outside, only to be welcomed by the view of four bachelors standing in that very balcony. It was strange, as hardly any residential society rented out to bachelors. But, who was she to complain?

She didn’t see him for the next couple of days, much to her disappointment. She told her mother, who she was very close to, who banged the latch of the balcony door three times and laughed it off, saying that the guy will be out in a matter of seconds, and walked back into the house. Her laughter hadn’t yet died and the man was out in the balcony, with a sleepy face, rubbing his eyes with a confused look on his face, looking at her. She couldn’t believe he actually came out to the sound of a door’s latch.

And it began.

In a matter of days, it became their signal, their call, and he would go out whenever he would hear the door latch bang against the hard metal of her balcony door. His door was only wooden, so he would cough instead, and she would go running out, and they would stare at each other for hours, pretending they were just hanging out in their balconies, unaware of each other’s presence.

Days turned into weeks, and their affair deepened. A persistent cough, a door latch banging, followed by hours of time spent in their balconies where would pretend to be out for a smoke, and she would pretend to be enjoying her playlist whilst walked to and fro. Every time she would turn while walking, she would catch a front glimpse of him, looking at her, with a tension between them that one could slice through, only to find a passion that could burn anyone who came in between whatever they had.

Soon they had the confidence to stare straight into each other’s eyes, and she felt as if he was looking right into her soul, she felt a raw, uncontrollable emotion she couldn’t quite name.

It surely couldn’t be love, as she was dating this one guy who had caught her attention for years.

The boyfriend came over one afternoon, and as they sat out in her balcony enjoying the warm sun, the mysterious man came outside and looked at her. He went back inside as fast as he had come out, and she couldn’t understand why… was he jealous?

If he was, then this affair was too far deep to be reigned back in.

She spent a wonderful day with her beau, who before taking her leave, pulled her into a warm embrace as they stood in her room, and left her with a kiss on the lips. As they parted, she realized her balcony door had been open all along, and ‘he’ might have witnessed her with another man. She ignored the thought, she hadn’t done anything wrong, and went downstairs to see her beau off. While walking back up to her apartment, she saw him sitting on the boundary wall of his balcony, look at her and then look away. In that moment, she realized he had witnessed her hugging and kissing another man and was upset about it.

She went out in the balcony, and hoped he would look at her, but he didn’t. She coughed, but he didn’t look. She decided, two could play this game. Armed with a small blanket to keep her from catching a cold, and her stool, she went and sat outside. It was a long night, he was upset, and she was guilty. They both stayed out the entire night, ignoring each other, in the bitter cold. He didn’t budge from his spot on the boundary wall, nor did she, except for the occasional stroll. After some five hours, into the early hours of the morning where the sky was still dark, he got up, went inside, and then she saw him leave the building. She felt she did her best to make up for what had upset him, without using any words. She cried herself to sleep at night, torn in her heart about what she felt, and for which man her feelings were stronger.

She woke up the next morning, only to find him sitting with a girl in his balcony. She felt jealous, but guessed she deserved it. Her mother, who had been witnessing all this, felt that enough was enough, asked her to call whatever was going on, off. The very thought brought her to her knees for he had become a part of her day, her night, her dreams. Every afternoon while returning from college, she would look up before entering her building, to find him looking at her from above, she would spend hours walking in her balcony in the evenings, for that one look of him which she would catch when she turned to his side of the balcony.

It wasn’t just her though, she was a part of his day too. He would leave for his job every evening and cough before he did so, for she would come in the balcony and he would see her one last time for the night. As he walked out of the building with his friends, he made sure he was the last to leave, so he could look up at her balcony, into her eyes, and not have his friends notice it. He didn’t want them to see her, she was his.

The mother was firm, it had to end. So she went outside, coughed, he came out, and with a signal of hands, she conveyed that they could no longer continue what had gone on for so long, as she was in a relationship with a guy one could not flaw. He looked surprised at first, since she was attempting to make conversation. Till now, all their volumes were spoken only by the eyes. His expression soon turned to that of sadness, and he went back inside. So did she, but not before she had broken down in an ocean of tears. Days passed by, and she didn’t see him in the balcony. She saw his friends, but never him.

This one cloudy evening, fate gave her another chance to make a choice. She saw him standing in the balcony, his back towards her, smoking a cigarette. She went outside, no longer was she in charge of logic or reason. She was far behind any rationality, and in too deep. She prayed for him to turn, and just as he did, their eyes met. She signalled him to stop, and he did, and watched her hold her ears to ask for an apology, which he ever so readily afforded her, by smiling wide at her. Their saga resumed.

They no longer pretended to not acknowledge what was happening between them, and they started straight at each other every evening. He never left for work without seeing her once, till this one particular evening.

She had gone to the market that evening, and knew that he would be waiting for her. As she walked back to her building, she saw him, on the road, outside a cab, taking to the driver. Their eyes met, he smiled, entered the cab, and went his way. She then realized, this affair had transcended attraction, it was so much more than that. He couldn’t leave without seeing her.

A few evenings later, as she was walking in her society, she saw him in his classic red hoodie, as she approached the main gate. Her pace slowed, as did his. He was only a few metres away from her, separated only by a massive iron gate. Neither could gather to courage to move towards each other. What would they say? They had experienced everything a traditional relationship does, a meeting, their own language, flirting, jealousy, a short break, and a rekindling of the same romance, which had only emboldened them.

What does one say in words after having said so much without them? Their relationship had transcended words, it was unique, extraordinary, and neither wanted to jinx it. Their bond was surreal, and words would make it all too real.

Came New Year, and he got drunk, very drunk. He walked out in his balcony and coughed. He shouted out, asking for her to come out. He kept shouting hello, and asking loudly why she wasn’t coming out. It pained her to see him like this, and all she wanted was to do as he asked, but was afraid, as it was past midnight, and had she gone, who knew what else he might say.

All this while, her heart was drowning in guilt, for she loved someone else too, in a different way, but it was love all the same. She didn’t mean for any of this to happen, and she didn’t know what to do. She made a choice after moistening many tissues, courtesy her swollen eyes, and chose her boyfriend as the one she would stay with. But her mystery man was making it difficult for her to stay true to her decision, so she dropped a letter to his society’s office, complaining about the drunken ruckus and drug use the bachelors staying in their society were indulging in.

She couldn’t take it back now, she had cut the cord on their affair. She watched his friends carry luggage and their precious plant into an auto and leave, and he wasn’t there. She went to college the next, and came home to find her mother with the most extraordinary story. Her mother had heard a lot of coughing from outside, and upon going out in the balcony, she had found the bachelor pacing about in his balcony, looking at their balcony. He had apparently waited a long time, before eventually leaving. She broke down again, she didn’t get to say goodbye, and he was gone.

Come next morning, she heard a cough. Afraid to get disappointed, she stayed in bed. Hope got the better of her, she got up, put on her spectacles, and ran out to the balcony, to find him standing in his. She cried, and he saw, and they stayed that way for some time. He then went back inside and so did she, unsure of what to do next. She was deeply attached to him, and it made no sense, for they never had had what one might call a real conversation.

A couple of hours later, she heard a cough, and ran out, to find him standing inside his room, the window ajar. His friend was standing alongside him, considerably out of view. They looked at each other, with pain in their eyes, for their relationship was moments away from its end. He stared at her, taking in the last look to last him for all days to come, and his friend had to nudge him from his daze, the window had to be closed, they had to go, and I had to be left behind as a love with no name.

Reluctantly he slid his window shut, as slowly as he could manage, never taking his eyes off her, as she stood, praying for time to stand still. She knew she would see him leave the building for the very last time, which he did, but he did not look up. He just walked away.

Maybe they lacked the courage to make themselves a possibility, or maybe they had the courage to let go. They were far beyond what words could achieve, and they would have done no good. Where would they have gone from there? They knew nothing about each other, not even each other’s names, but they had still loved each other in their own twisted way, and felt all emotions any great relationship has to offer.

Not all love stories reach their happily ever after. They just are, magnificent in their fiery passions that burn bright but never forever.

And to think it all started with the darned cannabis plant that had caught her attention as she struggled to read what wise old Plato had to offer on one very ordinary winter afternoon.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was trying to finish an entire semester worth of Political Thought in a matter of three afternoons. Of last minute preparations, she was the fucking queen. Pushing with irregular kicks a big stool to sit on, and a small one to rest her feet on, she proceeded to her small but cozy L-shaped balcony. The sun was a welcome friend to beat the winter nip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With her back to the wall adjacent to her door, she comfortably positioned herself, and picked up the first chapter, ten pages roughly torn from a spiral binding, held together firmly by two staple pins. One could read Plato only for so long, she looked up to scan her eyes through the houses of the society facing hers. Clothes drying outside balconies, children playing, women talking across balconies, nothing caught her eye. She tried to bring her focus back to wise old Plato. Abruptly disturbing her short spanned focus came her mother into the balcony with a glass of buttermilk, her favorite afternoon drink. She drank, as her mother proceeded to hang clothes to dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She began looking at the houses, and a peculiar potted plant caught her eye, it looked vaguely familiar, yet odd. She asked her mother about it, who did not seem to be able to place it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She continued to study till the sun was out, after which she went inside and nothing interesting happened to her till the next evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next evening, she went outside to accompany her mother who was out drying clothes, an everyday feature, when the peculiar potted plant was made very interesting by the man behind it, watering it. Fair, bearded, penetrating eyes and an uncanny, mysterious handsomeness. He was the kind of man your mother warns you against. It began raining soon after, and she went outside, only to be welcomed by the view of four bachelors standing in that very balcony. It was strange, as hardly any residential society rented out to bachelors. But, who was she to complain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And maybe add a little doodle that represents your country or state. 
Then just take a picture of you holding it outside. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be next to your favourite landmark, or just outside in the road. You could be in the picture, or just show your hand holding it out. Any way you want &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d give an example, but I can’t post pictures here. We’ve already gotten friends in Australia (who drew a picture of a kangaroo) and Nevada US (who showed a beautiful casino). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you help us show Andy how far his wonderful girlfriend’s love reaches?&lt;/p&gt;

I heard my mom watching some bad comedy sketch on Facebook (I know, already off to a great start) about how the elderly/family/etc pictures always told a story, whereas the kind of stuff you see on Instagram (i.e. food, selfies, etc) do not. This popped up in my head about a month later and I thought about how absolutely untrue that could possibly be. Yeah, sure, most of the time it might not have substance, but what about the times there is?

”Hey, Grandma, why did you take a picture of your dinner?” “Oh, this? Oh! I remember that! That was at a hibachi restaurant with your grandpa! At the time, this was our third date, and...”

”Dad, why‘d you take a selfie of you in a suit?” “Funny story, actually. I was trying on a suit for my first date with my first boyfriend, and I wanted to see how I looked. I was really nervous that I was going to look stupid or say something weird, but...”

”Hey, Auntie Anna? What’s this selfie with you and Uncle Pat?” “Oh, this one was from when we went on our second date at a coffee shop! It’s funny, really - most people go for the coffee shop first, but the first was a carnival - anyway...”

Dunno where to start fellas, but I really am feeling that I can't talk about this with anyone in my inner circle that would understand what I really mean and I hope you, as the readers, will understand this in some way.Also, I already had a couple of conversations concerning this subject, but it was always the same response from my friends, chase her, tell her you like her yadi yadi yada

Also note, I'm that type of romantic guy that will try and indirectly show that I care for the girl if she starts to give me those small signals and those ""test"" questions. Y'all know what I'm talking about (hopefully...)and I can build easily emotional connections with chicks ( not to brag about it or anything but I really developed this shit through experience let's say)

I'll start explaining;

so I got into a situation where I met this girl let's call her K (easier to understand for y'all)and it all began in the summer when K came over to my house thanks to a friend of my brother.Basically the scenario played like this;I go on my terrace with a friend of mine and suddenly I see there's this girl, K, and when our eyes met, I felt a direct connection with her( we could call this love on first sight).Afterwards, you could see me sitting down next to her on my terrace, while there were other dicks around let's say, but I didn't care much at the time about the people around me, it was just my curiousness that took **me** over.

I wanted to get to know her, so we started doing small talk etc... Fast forward I got her snapchat one day and then we started vibin step by step.Next thing you know, she sends me her phone number (happy yay), which indicates I'm playing the right cards.

Then one day she asks me to meet up, but at the time I was with a homie of mine and so I asked her if she was aight with it, she said OK.Fast forward, we vibin with 3, and when she arrives, our eyes meet again and that night she couldn't stop looking in mine.

My friend told me that btw, because I asked him what he thinks about her ( since y'all fellas gotta know that if a future gf doesn't vibe with your close friends, you better next her) and he tells me, DUDE she was all into you !!!

next thing I know we talk about the deep stuff, we got that emotional connection smoothly going, so you can imagine you meet this X girl and you and her exchange ideas dreams etc and you feel like you two are going somewhere.

I decide one day to meet for a date then, but she was on vacation for a couple of days, so i had to maintain those positive vibes with her, u feel me guys?

Fast forward again, the day she comes back in town, she texts me I'M BACK.We then normally had to see eachother that night but I was in the wrong time and wrong place let's say.Finally, I call her to tell her let's do something fun and so see agrees to see me later that night.We then go out to a bar not far away ( ALSO SMALL DETAIL I FORGOT TO MENTION, SHE LIVES 5MIN AWAY FROM ME ) and get a couple of drinks, smoke a J and then she tells me to get over to her place...

I then agreed and went on to hers, she tells me no one is home till tomorrow evening ( her mom is out of town )so we start vibin chilling with some music, getting to know her personally this time.She shows me personal writings of her that she had to do for school once and I felt that complex mind of hers. She also read them out loud and I read one as well out loud, which leads me to start thinking she's that type of that girl could like a letter ( i'll write about the letter at the end)

the problem is I don't kiss chicks on the first date.. but I think I should've done it with K. I also think that i'm fucking things up right now and tripping too hard on this chick ( overthinking )

Which leads me to the present;I am going in a couple of days on vacation ( on the 17th) and I thought to drop by her house before going on vacation and slip in a letter with my confession ( that romantic stuff...) about simply being with her and that in those couple of months that I ""spent"" with K, i felt that she could be the type of girl that could push me towards my goals and I could be that person for her and simply put, say that I love her and I think honestly that she would appreciate this because of the letters thing she showed me ( I think it was an indirect way of her showing me she cares about me since it was really personal stuff) and it's kinda cute in my opinion ( don't know what you're thinking bout this one guys and girls..)

So the question is am I a fucktard that overthinks and overanalyses this shit? Or am I a tard that is in love and should still write this letter?

I could use any help...

SO PLEASE ANY ADVICE WOULD BE APPRECIATED

P.S. : our vibe rn is kinda chill I'm not pushing on anything but I think I should still do *something (that something is writing that handwritten letter)* before I take my plane(I know people live seperate lifes and that she may be busy planning stuff, sorting her life out, etc I'm just thinking about her too much lately and I think she feels something for me but she's shy asf... also I'm thinking if not now then when) and college/uni starts again... which means I think we're going to be seperated ( since she's attending another school than me) and we'll be taking our own ways...

P.P.S. : This might sound crazy but I really like this girl and I think that we could be a nice relationship if I don't fuck up and find some omen or answer here hopefully","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First time posting here...,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the problem is I don&amp;#39;t kiss chicks on the first date.. but I think I should&amp;#39;ve done it with K. I also think that i&amp;#39;m fucking things up right now and tripping too hard on this chick ( overthinking )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which leads me to the present;I am going in a couple of days on vacation ( on the 17th) and I thought to drop by her house before going on vacation and slip in a letter with my confession ( that romantic stuff...) about simply being with her and that in those couple of months that I &amp;quot;spent&amp;quot; with K, i felt that she could be the type of girl that could push me towards my goals and I could be that person for her and simply put, say that I love her and I think honestly that she would appreciate this because of the letters thing she showed me ( I think it was an indirect way of her showing me she cares about me since it was really personal stuff) and it&amp;#39;s kinda cute in my opinion ( don&amp;#39;t know what you&amp;#39;re thinking bout this one guys and girls..)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question is am I a fucktard that overthinks and overanalyses this shit? Or am I a tard that is in love and should still write this letter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could use any help...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SO PLEASE ANY ADVICE WOULD BE APPRECIATED&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. : our vibe rn is kinda chill I&amp;#39;m not pushing on anything but I think I should still do &lt;em&gt;something (that something is writing that handwritten letter)&lt;/em&gt; before I take my plane(I know people live seperate lifes and that she may be busy planning stuff, sorting her life out, etc I&amp;#39;m just thinking about her too much lately and I think she feels something for me but she&amp;#39;s shy asf... also I&amp;#39;m thinking if not now then when) and college/uni starts again... which means I think we&amp;#39;re going to be seperated ( since she&amp;#39;s attending another school than me) and we&amp;#39;ll be taking our own ways...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.P.S. : This might sound crazy but I really like this girl and I think that we could be a nice relationship if I don&amp;#39;t fuck up and find some omen or answer here hopefully&lt;/p&gt;

I’m Venus. Okay, that’s not my real name but anonymity is a thing, so yeah. You can call me V. And I’m trying to win over my crush. But let me give you some background info so you can kinda be more up to speed on my life.

I’m a college student in a pretty rural area and I’m a pretty down to earth girl. Back in high school, I met a ton of people who ended up coming to the same college as me, as some stories go. Now my crush, Mars (not his real name), is a year below me. Yeah, yeah, I know, weird. But he’s a super cool guy. Back in high school, him and I would chill because he was pretty dope. I guess you could say that’s when my crush started. 

Fast forward a few years and here we are. Both in college. He’s still a year below me, but it seems to matter less now. He and I roll in similar groups, so we hang every once in awhile. I wanna win his heart, but I’m not sure how... I guess that’s why I’m documenting it so that you guys can follow with me and I can have some support. 

Let me tell you about Mars. Mars is tall, light skinned, super talented and goofy. Mars has dimples and an auspicious nose. Mars has curly hair and smiling, warm, inviting eyes. Mars  mocks me but he doesn’t mean it. Mars has a face etched by Michelangelo himself. Mars has the kindest heart I have ever known. And the last thing you need to know is this: Mars has my heart.


I don’t know if Mars know how I feel, and I’m not gonna tell him just yet, but I am currently in the process of getting him to tutor me so that we can spend more time together. I’ll keep y’all posted with any updates.

I met this guy online (I know bad start) we just started talking and getting to know each other. We created a friend circle and got along with everyone. However, I was told by one of the mutual friends that this guy and I would be a really cute couple. I could see it and agreed. I started pushing him a bit more, to see if he liked me or not. I received enough info that was in my favor and said ""I like you"" to him one day. He said that he felt the same but because of our age difference (and me being a minor) we decided to not really be a thing. Then suddenly one day a month after we expressed how we felt about each other I received a group text from him showing he booked a hotel near where I lived. I was kind of really freaked out. Like, we hadn't talked to each other about this. He just decided he was coming. I shrugged off how I felt and rolled with it. Two months went by and the big date came! I was going to meet him irl. I was scared to death! I asked a friend to track me while I was out and if I don't responded to her texts then something was wrong. So everything was going fine, awkward, but fine. We ended up walking to our cars and he stopped. I could feel what was coming. We hugged and uncomfortable hug. I tried to leave and said something like ""well better get going"" but he just starred at me. I was like sheet. I went a bit closer to my car and went further away from him. We were like three feet apart. Then all of a sudden he started moving closer to me with his eyes closed and his lips puckered up. I panicked and yelled ""NO!"" He looked shocked. IDK why but I started laughing, said goodbye and left. Since then I've lost all attraction I kind of had and just don't really know what to do. Break up with him? But how?

&lt;p&gt;I met this guy online (I know bad start) we just started talking and getting to know each other. We created a friend circle and got along with everyone. However, I was told by one of the mutual friends that this guy and I would be a really cute couple. I could see it and agreed. I started pushing him a bit more, to see if he liked me or not. I received enough info that was in my favor and said &amp;quot;I like you&amp;quot; to him one day. He said that he felt the same but because of our age difference (and me being a minor) we decided to not really be a thing.

However, a couple weeks ago I got off work on a Saturday and get a knock on the door. It's her, she stopped by under the pretense of asking a question about the guys that had painted our houses but ended up staying over for about 45 minutes talking and getting to know each other. We both agreed to get up later that night (which we did). Since then, she has been over literally EVERY single night. Nothing physical has happened yet, but her body language suggests to me that she may be into me. I'm really bad at reading things, but her eagerness to be around me all the time and the fact she is either at my place or I'm at hers almost every night tells me *something*. There was also one night when I was gone and she knocked on the door and my roommate answered and she inquired if I was out with ""some girl"". She is really inquisitive and intuitive, and hangs on every word....like, she will remember something I told her in passing from weeks ago that I don't even remember telling her.

We really gel well, she is beautiful, and single. Perfect right? Well, there are a few wrenches in the gears. For one, she hangs out with my roommate too when she's over (obviously, since he lives here), and when she invites me over she feels it necessary to invite him over too (as to not be rude). While he likes her plutonically, he has assured me time and time again that he's not interested in that regard but does value the friendship they have so far. She is aware of the fact he has a constant on-and-off relationship with his ex, and has met her as well, so I don't see her pursuing my roommate. I get plenty of alone time with her but am also scared to make any kind of move just simply because she's my neighbor. If I have misread things it would be terribly awkward and I wouldn't want to ruin a potential good friendship if things didn't go well. But I keep getting signs, and it has me emotionally confused to say the least. She is definitely what you would call a ""good girl"", and I can't picture her making the first move. We've shared our past relationships and talked openly about sex and things of the sort so I know she isn't a ""prude"" per say. Everyone I have talked to has told me she's waiting for me to show that I'm interested and not to expect her to make any moves. I'm just so confused as to what to do.

We definitely have chemistry, and I'm aware that if she didn't like me in some way she wouldn't be hanging around all the time. She has gotten more flirty, personal, and physically playful as of late but I am terrified of making the wrong move. I mean, maybe she's just really friendly? I don't know. Normally I can read these situations pretty easily, and most of the girls I have dated/been with have made their feelings obvious after a period of time, but she's different. I'm physically and mentally attracted to her equally. If my roommate wasn't around so much I think it would be a lot easier to gauge, but I can't say. All I know is I'm definitely catching feelings and I don't know how to approach it with this girl. I want to lay it on the line about how I feel so I don't miss my chance or seem like I am not interested but also don't want it to be too premature and scare her off.

So last Friday Night as those of you who read the story I wrote know, I hangout with my crush a second time and wasn't sure if it was a date or a hangout with friends. This past friday night I invited him to come towards the end of my shift at the face painting place, and he did. (I painted a flame and a pair of red lips on his hands🤭). Anyhow my shift ends and we go to the bleachers (this was a football scrimmage) to sit with his friends. We had a little fun, but then we just ended up facing eachother talking rather than talking with the group of friends. Then he suggested we go get snow cones, we go and this time I wasn't even prepared to pay for myself. Anywho, his friends ditched the game. And I suggested we go to the visitor's side cause I've always wanted to do that for some reason. On the way this old man stops us and asks me ""did he buy that snow cone for you?"" I was like ""yes"" and he was like ""that's what we old people call a date, that is unless he is your older brother"" I jokingly reply ""yep he's my brother"" and put my hand on his bicep. After that I was like ""he's not wrong you know, traditionally that would be a date"". Anywho we go to the other stands and this special ed girl joins us, I was happy to have her there at first but then things started getting awkward. I was so paranoid she could tell something was going on between us. Then she got upset cause she thought I didn't like her, which she tells Micheal after I walk away when she was trying to tell M that she thought this. He walks up to me and was like ""do you hate her?"" (In a totally insincere way cause he knew I didn't) so I go talk to her and decide to tell her no I don't hate her but yes I do want time alone with him cause I like him. So skip forward we all go back to the bleachers towards the top, and she acted so weird and kept winking at me. After some silence she's like I'm gonna go then whispers to me encouraging me to just tell him, he gets curious about what we were talking about. Then asks what was going on, and she gets all flustered and blurts out that she want me to tell him that SHE likes him and i tried really hard to cover it up and play it cool. But he saw through it and asks her to give us a second alone. And she was devastated because of what she had just done (and leaves). He scoots down next to me and was like ""Soo, are you gonna tell me what that was all about"". By that time I was curled up into a ball watching the game. My stomach was being tied in knots every which way. I gave him the *just a sec finger, as I decided what I wanted to do. Then I was like, ""she was trying to get me to tell you the obvious"". To which after about 1 second he replied ""I like you E"". I just looked at him and had one of those smiles that you can't stop no matter what you do. ""I was like, I was scared you wouldn't get what I meant by that"". He got all scared and was like ""did i get it wrong?"". I just said ""no, no you got it right. I like you."" And it was so cute because after that he said ""I like you too."" A second time. After that he walked me home and on the way he said ""So I like you and you like me, what happens next?"" I told him several times it was up to him. 
A cute little after story was on the way home I was like ""you remember when you sang in front of me then asked me to sing too and I was like 'I don't sing in front of people, you are in drama and are used to it' I don't sing, I rap."" The look on his face was priceless, I think it was one of those oh yea she's hot moments. And continue walking. He was like ""no uh uh, you don't get to just say something like that a walk away. Rap.""  I had been preparing to tell him this and show him so, but I got really scared. And then after me continuing walking he was like ""you can't go home yet, I still have your chair"" I ended up doing it and he was like that's good like really good. I chose the easier one of my two options, but I was like ok now I really want to do the other one. We ended up singing together cause it was River by Eminem and Ed Sheeran. It sounded so cool. And I did pretty good on delivering emotions in that one. Anywho that's all so far besides the fact that we went to his farm/family antique shop today and I met his Grandma, father, and mother. 

Until next time when hopefully I'll tell about our first kiss or atleast and holding. Or maybe me moving away and leaving him. 
P.s he told me through text that if it was alright with me he wanted to date me and that he really liked me, but also that we would deal with the whole moving thing when the time came.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So incase you&amp;#39;ve read what I wrote a week or two ago, here&amp;#39;s the rest if the story that is sure to continue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So last Friday Night as those of you who read the story I wrote know, I hangout with my crush a second time and wasn&amp;#39;t sure if it was a date or a hangout with friends. This past friday night I invited him to come towards the end of my shift at the face painting place, and he did. (I painted a flame and a pair of red lips on his hands🤭). Anyhow my shift ends and we go to the bleachers (this was a football scrimmage) to sit with his friends. We had a little fun, but then we just ended up facing eachother talking rather than talking with the group of friends. Then he suggested we go get snow cones, we go and this time I wasn&amp;#39;t even prepared to pay for myself. Anywho, his friends ditched the game. And I suggested we go to the visitor&amp;#39;s side cause I&amp;#39;ve always wanted to do that for some reason. On the way this old man stops us and asks me &amp;quot;did he buy that snow cone for you?&amp;quot; I was like &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; and he was like &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s what we old people call a date, that is unless he is your older brother&amp;quot; I jokingly reply &amp;quot;yep he&amp;#39;s my brother&amp;quot; and put my hand on his bicep. After that I was like &amp;quot;he&amp;#39;s not wrong you know, traditionally that would be a date&amp;quot;. Anywho we go to the other stands and this special ed girl joins us, I was happy to have her there at first but then things started getting awkward. I was so paranoid she could tell something was going on between us. Then she got upset cause she thought I didn&amp;#39;t like her, which she tells Micheal after I walk away when she was trying to tell M that she thought this. He walks up to me and was like &amp;quot;do you hate her?&amp;quot; (In a totally insincere way cause he knew I didn&amp;#39;t) so I go talk to her and decide to tell her no I don&amp;#39;t hate her but yes I do want time alone with him cause I like him. So skip forward we all go back to the bleachers towards the top, and she acted so weird and kept winking at me. After some silence she&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m gonna go then whispers to me encouraging me to just tell him, he gets curious about what we were talking about. Then asks what was going on, and she gets all flustered and blurts out that she want me to tell him that SHE likes him and i tried really hard to cover it up and play it cool. But he saw through it and asks her to give us a second alone. And she was devastated because of what she had just done (and leaves). He scoots down next to me and was like &amp;quot;Soo, are you gonna tell me what that was all about&amp;quot;. By that time I was curled up into a ball watching the game. My stomach was being tied in knots every which way. I gave him the *just a sec finger, as I decided what I wanted to do. Then I was like, &amp;quot;she was trying to get me to tell you the obvious&amp;quot;. To which after about 1 second he replied &amp;quot;I like you E&amp;quot;. I just looked at him and had one of those smiles that you can&amp;#39;t stop no matter what you do. &amp;quot;I was like, I was scared you wouldn&amp;#39;t get what I meant by that&amp;quot;. He got all scared and was like &amp;quot;did i get it wrong?&amp;quot;. I just said &amp;quot;no, no you got it right. I like you.&amp;quot; And it was so cute because after that he said &amp;quot;I like you too.&amp;quot; A second time. After that he walked me home and on the way he said &amp;quot;So I like you and you like me, what happens next?&amp;quot; I told him several times it was up to him.

And continue walking. He was like &amp;quot;no uh uh, you don&amp;#39;t get to just say something like that a walk away. Rap.&amp;quot;  I had been preparing to tell him this and show him so, but I got really scared. And then after me continuing walking he was like &amp;quot;you can&amp;#39;t go home yet, I still have your chair&amp;quot; I ended up doing it and he was like that&amp;#39;s good like really good.

All of what I write is true but if it is ever read, it will be hurtful.  However, I can’t apologize for honesty.  

For the past few weeks, I have been really struggling.  I woke up an old me that used to be me and this old me does not recognize or accept the world we live in.  I can understand, that old me is the real me crying out through 27 years of darkness wanting to live again and living with the moment he gave up and let the darkness take over.  I would give everything short of my soul to get that back, but even at that price, I can not see a way how that would ever be possible.  

There once was a me that was happy but lonely, purely romantic believing the slightest glimpse of hope in a sea of impossibility.  He just wanted love, believed in love, and loved the idea of love.  He had a faith but a more simple one.  He loved Jesus but wasn’t  full of love-killing theology and a church culture where image was everything.  There was a darkness then, but that darkness came from a place he did not know then and it was weak and in the background.  It made me fearful of hurt and hard to trust, but I met someone who saw that and broke through all that.  I found love.

As love is, that love ebbed and flowed at times but I never lost it.  She was my everything and even now that me believes losing her was the worst thing to ever happen in my life.  I can not disagree, that love overwhelmed the dark until the end.  But then something happened, something that tore through the trust I had and hurt me deeply.  At that point I had the choice to face that pain and work through it and make our love stronger than it ever was.  Instead, I opened the door to the dark and that me went to sleep.  I remember that day, in her bedroom, saying one thing while feeling my heart grow cold.  I felt my own death, or so I thought, and was determined to lash out.  This decision, in the end, ruined my life.  I am sure she found the love and happiness she deserves but as for me, I found nothing but cold, hurt, and emptiness and its something I still feel to this day.  

You see, at that moment I changed my life from the course it was supposed to take to where it is now.  I am living a life I was never meant to live.  How else can I explain why I find no joy, no fulfillment, no love, no peace, and living a life of perpetual failures.  Sure I put a lot of lipstick on this pig of a life, but once you scrape past the surface you see whats really there.  What you see is black.  What you see is death.  

Also how can you explain how this once nice loving romantic boy became the selfish heart-consuming monster that he has been.  I did not start off that way, but where I went after I left the first beat whatever humanity was left in my heart into nothing and whatever old the old me was left inside went deep into hiding.  She was evil, and to beat that evil, in the end I became more evil.  When I think about what I have done, all the lies I have told, all the ones I got to fall in love with me for a time just to get me to  the next “real” love, all the others I hurt but drawing some out of relationships all to just get tired of them and break it off slowly until they left me.  I was so good at being what I needed to be that I even forgot that I lost the real me.  

As for those “real” loves? Please.  They were just longer versions of the insignificant ones or ones who ultimately betrayed me and felt my emotional wrath.  I was so good at winning people back even after they left me.  

But no matter how many hearts I stole I could never fill the hole that was inside mine.  I never realized that instead of trying to find the next real love, I needed to be looking at the past to the one I actually had.  The dark would not let me.  I talked about that one so many times, looked at pictures, read notes in yearbooks, and really felt nothing.  

That is why this present situation is so perplexing. Why now after so many years has this suddenly been revealed?  Why open a door and let someone out into a world that is so detached from his reality that  all I can feel is his pain crying out from where he is tucked inside me and  insanely in love for someone not even seen for literally decades?  Is this some tragic hoax just to torture me a little more for the mistakes I made?  Or is it more?  The romantic part of old me wants to believe that it is.  That somehow someone else is feeling the same way and somehow this will all work out and in such a way that causes minimal pain.   Yes, I know the logic of that but remember the old me has a hard time accepting anything as impossible.  

What I do know is that I want to be old me again.  What I also know is that I can not be old me  without any connection to my world today.  What I also know is that I know of one person who can help.  What I also know is that living like I am now in a world I do not belong in as a me that is not real is not sustainable much longer.  I know that for the sake of my own emotional survival this all has to work out.  And therein lies the dilemma.  I do not see a way where  it can.  I am too respectful to even attempt to reach back into someone’s life and I do not know if I can handle it being unwelcome.  I am presently too weak for that.  I used to believe that love looking always finds love looking back.  That old me still does and it is hope that keeps me from completely breaking down each and every day.  How much more can I take of this? I dont know but I dont think its much.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I write today I do so with great hesitation.

&lt;p&gt;Also how can you explain how this once nice loving romantic boy became the selfish heart-consuming monster that he has been.  I did not start off that way, but where I went after I left the first beat whatever humanity was left in my heart into nothing and whatever old the old me was left inside went deep into hiding.  She was evil, and to beat that evil, in the end I became more evil.  When I think about what I have done, all the lies I have told, all the ones I got to fall in love with me for a time just to get me to  the next “real” love, all the others I hurt but drawing some out of relationships all to just get tired of them and break it off slowly until they left me.  I was so good at being what I needed to be that I even forgot that I lost the real me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for those “real” loves? Please.  They were just longer versions of the insignificant ones or ones who ultimately betrayed me and felt my emotional wrath.  I was so good at winning people back even after they left me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no matter how many hearts I stole I could never fill the hole that was inside mine.  I never realized that instead of trying to find the next real love, I needed to be looking at the past to the one I actually had.  The dark would not let me.  I talked about that one so many times, looked at pictures, read notes in yearbooks, and really felt nothing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why this present situation is so perplexing. Why now after so many years has this suddenly been revealed?  Why open a door and let someone out into a world that is so detached from his reality that  all I can feel is his pain crying out from where he is tucked inside me and  insanely in love for someone not even seen for literally decades?  Is this some tragic hoax just to torture me a little more for the mistakes I made?  Or is it more?  The romantic part of old me wants to believe that it is.  That somehow someone else is feeling the same way and somehow this will all work out and in such a way that causes minimal pain.   Yes, I know the logic of that but remember the old me has a hard time accepting anything as impossible.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I do know is that I want to be old me again.  What I also know is that I can not be old me  without any connection to my world today.  What I also know is that I know of one person who can help.  What I also know is that living like I am now in a world I do not belong in as a me that is not real is not sustainable much longer.  I know that for the sake of my own emotional survival this all has to work out.  And therein lies the dilemma.  I do not see a way where  it can.  I am too respectful to even attempt to reach back into someone’s life and I do not know if I can handle it being unwelcome.  I am presently too weak for that.  I used to believe that love looking always finds love looking back.  That old me still does and it is hope that keeps me from completely breaking down each and every day.  How much more can I take of this? I dont know but I dont think its much.&lt;/p&gt;

So plz read the story and tell me what it sounds like to you.

I am a mess right now in so many freaking ways. Let's start with meeting the curious charactor.

This past trimester there was a guy in English class who at first I hard core judged for always being late, having airpod things (not air pods but same concept) in nearly all class till he got caught, the way he confused me on whether he was just smart and bored or attention seeking, and lastly the way he DRESSED. He wore the same genre of clothes everyday. From his sleeveless, dark, camo tanks to the boots and jeans. What really confused me was a had one of those rapper boy chains that hang out of your pocket while holding onto your wallet. Who was this guy? Then one day, there was a dreaded group presentation in the form of acting. Me being the tentative girl I am I ended up seeing almost every person in the class forming their groups of 3 in the span of 2 seconds, while I sat there looking for a decent group to join. And guess who was in a group of 2 needing an extra, yep the boy and the girl NO ONE COULD HEAR when she talked. I got forced by the teacher into that group, so I stole the teacher's spinny chair (I had no other chair where they were sitting) and joined them. He was laughing at me the whole class period while I span around in the chair every once in a while. So we chose a scene from what we were studying ( I forgot to mention, it was Romeo and Juliet) and rehearsed it. We giggled together half the time, it was fun. I ended up having a small crush on him to my dismay. 
Break: A cute story 
One day our teacher gave us an assignment on the computers and I had to go charge it in the back of the room. As I recall I answered a question he (the teach) asked, while I was listening to his response to my answer I get this feeling I should look the guy in his eyes and smile cause at that point he was in my view, I listened to it and made quick eyes contact and smiled then looked straight back at the teacher, he smiled back. It was a sweet moment I'm glad I was brave in.
Back to it:
Every once in a while we'd end up standing next to each other in line before the bell, and he would look over at me and ask me a question sorta nervously. Fast forward to the day before finals. We ended up walking to our next class together, I had no clue they were both in the same hall way on the other side of the school previously. The next day was a class discussion where his normal seat got taken cause it was in the middle circle and I sat behind his row. The seat next to me was empty cause that person's group went first. So the guy came over to me after a few seconds of hin just standing ""scanning"" the room for an open seat, and sat down next to me after saying something along the lines of  ""There aren't any other seats open.""  I was thinking I don't care, sit where you want. Anywho, I drew a tic tac board on a peice of paper, marked the middle with an O, and slid it over to him. We played that for awhile till I got bored of winning, and drew a hangman and slid it over to him we played that till it was our groups turn to go in the middle. I got up and walked to the middle, sat down (not on purpose) right next to his usual chair. He follows and sits down in his chair, and he's all like ""I swear I'm not following you this is just my seat."" I was like didn't think you were. So class ends, and we walk together to the next class, except me being the secret blonde (I'm a brunette) I am, forgot that on finals lunch is after that class period. So I was walking with him and asked why everyone was in the cafeteria. As I asked him it dawned on me, and I just had that *face palm moment. I looked back at my usual table and it was FULL people were even standing just to be near it. I told him so, and he invited me to sit with him and his friends. I was like you know what screw it let's make a new friend or two. And sat with his friends (I actually knew 75% of them) so I was like WAHHHHHH. Here is where it gets kinda cute and confusing, he starts introducing all of his friends like how they do in movies where they're like ""that's Chase the idiot, that's Bridget she's depressed as hell"" and shes like 'f*** you' and starts laughing. And it was so cute and polite of him, but also unnecessary. So we just talked and towards the end he was like, ""sooo, do you wanna sit with us tomorrow?"" I was like ~YESSS are you kidding me you guys are so funny and weird like me~ on the inside, but I told him ""I would, but I'm leaving tomorrow."" He was then like ""aw man"" and a couple minutes later I was like should I ask him for his number or snapchat?? And what do ya, he is like ""Do you have snapchat?"" I was like ""Yes"" and obliviously resumed eating. he paused for a sec and was like ""caaan I have it?"" I was like ""Ohh, yea sure!""
The next day I sent him a few pics telling him where we were and when i arrived.
 Every once in a while he'd say hi and sometimes that would turn into a long convo others i got distracted or he had to go. Mid summer he was like we haven't talked in a while, how has your summer been so far? And from then out the talking was at an all time high cause that weekend was our town's yearly summer festival, and he asked if I was gonna be at the parade. I was like, I am IN it. I asked if he was gonna be there and he was like yea. So I was like I'll look out for you and maybe say hi real quick. Ended up missing him, but he saw me (in the best moment where we were doing our super cute dance) i was like, I looked for you but I couldn't see ya. We ended up hanging out there, however, it was our first time hanging out together so we were a little shy and slightly awkward, but eventually we had fun. Another sign that he maybe was into me too, was he kept wanting to buy me something. But that wasn't the only thing, he also did something really sweet that was being really sensitive towards me and my needs, I have a low blood sugar issue and I had just been in the sun walking and cheering for and hour, so I started to get a little dizzy/lightheaded and nauseous. But I didn't tell him he just noticed and was like are you ok? I was so taken aback by this, a guy who I sorta knew could tell when I was attempting to hide not feeling well. (I let him buy some honey for me beforehand cause I could tell he really wanted to, and I didn't want to take advantage of a nice act, so that was a cheap thing) so that was already gonna to help me feel better before I began to feel sick) Skip forward I went on another vacation this one brought some world crashing news (my small world). My father wanted to move us to another state and started looking at homes while we were supposed to be on vacation without asking us beforehand. After that I didn't think it was real(denial), till everything was going so fast that I couldn't ignore what was going on. Things at home are getting super stressful and everyone is being really mean to eachother my parents to each other, my brother and my mother, my brother to me. Its was awful, on top of that we got sick with a flu thing so I told the guy how sick I was and we started talking again. Till this point I didn't want to tell him cause all I wanted to do was keep that friendship normal and not sad. But it got to a point where me telling to my mom about what was going on inside my head was not an option cause I didn't want to give her one more reason to want to give up and leave my dad. So I told him, cause sadly enough, I don't really have many true friends anymore. I decided to give him a chance since he was the person I'd been praying for, the person who WANTED to be around me who TOOK initiative to talk to me, invite me to things, and everything. The previous year, no one (but one person kinda) did that I was crying all the time cause of how lonely it was since I fell out with my middle school best friend. What amazes me was that after I did tell him, he asked me questions about+made sure I was ok not only that be even though i was on the road for leaving the state sometime soon, he STILL wanted to be around me no matter what mood I was in. And previously this week after a little while of silence he said hey and invited me to a thing called music on the green. I couldn't go, but we planned to go to something the next day. But then I realized I'd already seen the movie that was playing several times, so I worked really hard that day and my parents actually let me go hangout with him no conditions (except be home by 8 which I broke woops). So I get to the ice cream place where we decided on meeting at. What was super sweet and ahhh, I got my own ice cream with my coupon and I HATED it. I mentioned that I really didn't like the flavor cherry, and you know what he did??? He freaken got me another even though I refused to let him. We sat on the bench outside for a while and talked. About the move a tiny bit but i tried to keep it off that subject, cause who wants a drag for a friend right? He made the point of ""what type of friend wouldn't want to listen to their friend when that person is going through something?"" Next we were just walking and went past a bed store and he was like, you wanna go in? I was like hmm ... hmmm.. then I was yet again like screw it this'll be a funny story to tell one day. So we went in and that ended up being sooo fun. We walked to walmart and I found my other actual friend the one I mentioned earlier there, so we hung out with her for a little while. She actually knew him too and apparently calls him Tarzan. She had to go with her parents, and I was like that was pretty much my only real friend, and he just got this look on his face and asked then what am I? And I was like well at first you were just a friend but not quite a real one, the you got better? It was really awkward cause I didn't want to friend zone him, but I also didn't want to deny how much his friendship had begun to mean to me. After that we got my bike and I decided to just walk home with him (we live near eachother) it was so nice. I felt the best I'd felt in weeks and laughed harder and more too. At one point we asked the same thing at the same time. That moment was just so hilarious and we found something we had in common from it. When we reached my house he stopped and was like ""so just so we're clear, I was wondering if you wanted to hangout again."" I just couldn't keep a straight face so I smiled and said ""yes""  he then said something about not scaring me off. So ever since then, my minds just been going crazy, wth does he like me or not. Am I just a friend like all his other numerous friends? Or was that a date and he likes me and it's just an unsaid thing. I have a gut feeling that he may, but on the other hand he could just be trying to be kind and polite towards me. 
About half way through writing this, I was thinking ""I'm moving in either a month or over that I just don't know, should i just send this to him explaining everything that has happened from my point of view. And hopefully he'll respond positively. If not then I can move on and just stay his friend if he'll let me."" 

In case I have shown this to you, Michael, you already know by this point but I like you more than just a treasured friend who has helped me more than he knows just by saying hi when he doesn't even know I've just had a rough day. I'm sorry if me showing you this has made you uncomfortable, or anything. If you don't like me back, please just tell me, I'm stronger than you think I can handle rejection it's fine. If you do, it's up to you what happens next. The ball is now in your court man.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin, I want to ask for advice on what to do with this guy who has a ton of female friends that I have no idea if im different from them. So plz read the story and tell me what it sounds like to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a mess right now in so many freaking ways. Let&amp;#39;s start with meeting the curious charactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past trimester there was a guy in English class who at first I hard core judged for always being late, having airpod things (not air pods but same concept) in nearly all class till he got caught, the way he confused me on whether he was just smart and bored or attention seeking, and lastly the way he DRESSED. He wore the same genre of clothes everyday. From his sleeveless, dark, camo tanks to the boots and jeans. What really confused me was a had one of those rapper boy chains that hang out of your pocket while holding onto your wallet. Who was this guy? Then one day, there was a dreaded group presentation in the form of acting. Me being the tentative girl I am I ended up seeing almost every person in the class forming their groups of 3 in the span of 2 seconds, while I sat there looking for a decent group to join. And guess who was in a group of 2 needing an extra, yep the boy and the girl NO ONE COULD HEAR when she talked. I got forced by the teacher into that group, so I stole the teacher&amp;#39;s spinny chair (I had no other chair where they were sitting) and joined them. He was laughing at me the whole class period while I span around in the chair every once in a while. So we chose a scene from what we were studying ( I forgot to mention, it was Romeo and Juliet) and rehearsed it. We giggled together half the time, it was fun. I ended up having a small crush on him to my dismay. 
Break: A cute story 
One day our teacher gave us an assignment on the computers and I had to go charge it in the back of the room. As I recall I answered a question he (the teach) asked, while I was listening to his response to my answer I get this feeling I should look the guy in his eyes and smile cause at that point he was in my view, I listened to it and made quick eyes contact and smiled then looked straight back at the teacher, he smiled back. It was a sweet moment I&amp;#39;m glad I was brave in.
Back to it:
Every once in a while we&amp;#39;d end up standing next to each other in line before the bell, and he would look over at me and ask me a question sorta nervously. Fast forward to the day before finals. We ended up walking to our next class together, I had no clue they were both in the same hall way on the other side of the school previously. The next day was a class discussion where his normal seat got taken cause it was in the middle circle and I sat behind his row. The seat next to me was empty cause that person&amp;#39;s group went first. So the guy came over to me after a few seconds of hin just standing &amp;quot;scanning&amp;quot; the room for an open seat, and sat down next to me after saying something along the lines of  &amp;quot;There aren&amp;#39;t any other seats open.&amp;quot;  I was thinking I don&amp;#39;t care, sit where you want. Anywho, I drew a tic tac board on a peice of paper, marked the middle with an O, and slid it over to him. We played that for awhile till I got bored of winning, and drew a hangman and slid it over to him we played that till it was our groups turn to go in the middle. I got up and walked to the middle, sat down (not on purpose) right next to his usual chair. He follows and sits down in his chair, and he&amp;#39;s all like &amp;quot;I swear I&amp;#39;m not following you this is just my seat.&amp;quot; I was like didn&amp;#39;t think you were. So class ends, and we walk together to the next class, except me being the secret blonde (I&amp;#39;m a brunette) I am, forgot that on finals lunch is after that class period. So I was walking with him and asked why everyone was in the cafeteria. As I asked him it dawned on me, and I just had that &lt;em&gt;face palm moment. I looked back at my usual table and it was FULL people were even standing just to be near it. I told him so, and he invited me to sit with him and his friends. I was like you know what screw it let&amp;#39;s make a new friend or two. And sat with his friends (I actually knew 75% of them) so I was like WAHHHHHH. Here is where it gets kinda cute and confusing, he starts introducing all of his friends like how they do in movies where they&amp;#39;re like &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s Chase the idiot, that&amp;#39;s Bridget she&amp;#39;s depressed as hell&amp;quot; and shes like &amp;#39;f&lt;/em&gt;** you&amp;#39; and starts laughing. And it was so cute and polite of him, but also unnecessary. So we just talked and towards the end he was like, &amp;quot;sooo, do you wanna sit with us tomorrow?&amp;quot; I was like ~YESSS are you kidding me you guys are so funny and weird like me~ on the inside, but I told him &amp;quot;I would, but I&amp;#39;m leaving tomorrow.&amp;quot; He was then like &amp;quot;aw man&amp;quot; and a couple minutes later I was like should I ask him for his number or snapchat?? And what do ya, he is like &amp;quot;Do you have snapchat?&amp;quot; I was like &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; and obliviously resumed eating. he paused for a sec and was like &amp;quot;caaan I have it?&amp;quot; I was like &amp;quot;Ohh, yea sure!&amp;quot;
The next day I sent him a few pics telling him where we were and when i arrived.
 Every once in a while he&amp;#39;d say hi and sometimes that would turn into a long convo others i got distracted or he had to go. Mid summer he was like we haven&amp;#39;t talked in a while, how has your summer been so far? And from then out the talking was at an all time high cause that weekend was our town&amp;#39;s yearly summer festival, and he asked if I was gonna be at the parade. I was like, I am IN it. I asked if he was gonna be there and he was like yea. So I was like I&amp;#39;ll look out for you and maybe say hi real quick. Ended up missing him, but he saw me (in the best moment where we were doing our super cute dance) i was like, I looked for you but I couldn&amp;#39;t see ya. We ended up hanging out there, however, it was our first time hanging out together so we were a little shy and slightly awkward, but eventually we had fun. Another sign that he maybe was into me too, was he kept wanting to buy me something. But that wasn&amp;#39;t the only thing, he also did something really sweet that was being really sensitive towards me and my needs, I have a low blood sugar issue and I had just been in the sun walking and cheering for and hour, so I started to get a little dizzy/lightheaded and nauseous. But I didn&amp;#39;t tell him he just noticed and was like are you ok? I was so taken aback by this, a guy who I sorta knew could tell when I was attempting to hide not feeling well. (I let him buy some honey for me beforehand cause I could tell he really wanted to, and I didn&amp;#39;t want to take advantage of a nice act, so that was a cheap thing) so that was already gonna to help me feel better before I began to feel sick) Skip forward I went on another vacation this one brought some world crashing news (my small world). My father wanted to move us to another state and started looking at homes while we were supposed to be on vacation without asking us beforehand. After that I didn&amp;#39;t think it was real(denial), till everything was going so fast that I couldn&amp;#39;t ignore what was going on. Things at home are getting super stressful and everyone is being really mean to eachother my parents to each other, my brother and my mother, my brother to me. Its was awful, on top of that we got sick with a flu thing so I told the guy how sick I was and we started talking again. Till this point I didn&amp;#39;t want to tell him cause all I wanted to do was keep that friendship normal and not sad. But it got to a point where me telling to my mom about what was going on inside my head was not an option cause I didn&amp;#39;t want to give her one more reason to want to give up and leave my dad. So I told him, cause sadly enough, I don&amp;#39;t really have many true friends anymore. I decided to give him a chance since he was the person I&amp;#39;d been praying for, the person who WANTED to be around me who TOOK initiative to talk to me, invite me to things, and everything. The previous year, no one (but one person kinda) did that I was crying all the time cause of how lonely it was since I fell out with my middle school best friend. What amazes me was that after I did tell him, he asked me questions about+made sure I was ok not only that be even though i was on the road for leaving the state sometime soon, he STILL wanted to be around me no matter what mood I was in. And previously this week after a little while of silence he said hey and invited me to a thing called music on the green. I couldn&amp;#39;t go, but we planned to go to something the next day. But then I realized I&amp;#39;d already seen the movie that was playing several times, so I worked really hard that day and my parents actually let me go hangout with him no conditions (except be home by 8 which I broke woops). So I get to the ice cream place where we decided on meeting at. What was super sweet and ahhh, I got my own ice cream with my coupon and I HATED it. I mentioned that I really didn&amp;#39;t like the flavor cherry, and you know what he did??? He freaken got me another even though I refused to let him. We sat on the bench outside for a while and talked. About the move a tiny bit but i tried to keep it off that subject, cause who wants a drag for a friend right? He made the point of &amp;quot;what type of friend wouldn&amp;#39;t want to listen to their friend when that person is going through something?&amp;quot; Next we were just walking and went past a bed store and he was like, you wanna go in? I was like hmm ... hmmm.. then I was yet again like screw it this&amp;#39;ll be a funny story to tell one day. So we went in and that ended up being sooo fun. We walked to walmart and I found my other actual friend the one I mentioned earlier there, so we hung out with her for a little while. She actually knew him too and apparently calls him Tarzan. She had to go with her parents, and I was like that was pretty much my only real friend, and he just got this look on his face and asked then what am I? And I was like well at first you were just a friend but not quite a real one, the you got better? It was really awkward cause I didn&amp;#39;t want to friend zone him, but I also didn&amp;#39;t want to deny how much his friendship had begun to mean to me. After that we got my bike and I decided to just walk home with him (we live near eachother) it was so nice. I felt the best I&amp;#39;d felt in weeks and laughed harder and more too. At one point we asked the same thing at the same time. That moment was just so hilarious and we found something we had in common from it. When we reached my house he stopped and was like &amp;quot;so just so we&amp;#39;re clear, I was wondering if you wanted to hangout again.&amp;quot; I just couldn&amp;#39;t keep a straight face so I smiled and said &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;  he then said something about not scaring me off. So ever since then, my minds just been going crazy, wth does he like me or not. Am I just a friend like all his other numerous friends? Or was that a date and he likes me and it&amp;#39;s just an unsaid thing. I have a gut feeling that he may, but on the other hand he could just be trying to be kind and polite towards me. 
About half way through writing this, I was thinking &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m moving in either a month or over that I just don&amp;#39;t know, should i just send this to him explaining everything that has happened from my point of view. And hopefully he&amp;#39;ll respond positively. If not then I can move on and just stay his friend if he&amp;#39;ll let me.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case I have shown this to you, Michael, you already know by this point but I like you more than just a treasured friend who has helped me more than he knows just by saying hi when he doesn&amp;#39;t even know I&amp;#39;ve just had a rough day. I&amp;#39;m sorry if me showing you this has made you uncomfortable, or anything. If you don&amp;#39;t like me back, please just tell me, I&amp;#39;m stronger than you think I can handle rejection it&amp;#39;s fine. If you do, it&amp;#39;s up to you what happens next. The ball is now in your court man.&lt;/p&gt;

That person says i matured but i really dont think i did. Is there a way that i can be more of a mature gentlemen to girls? Also i know this is a strange question but, at my age group people get acne, plus for me it is hereditary. Is there a fast way to clear it because it is a very big letdown when people look at me. I have tried a face wash which does not really help. Hope i can get some answers for these pretty strange questions.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2017 I met a girl (Let's call her ""C"") on a trip to PEI, the smallest province in Canada. Our mothers were friends for 31 years leading up to that. We hit it off immediately and started to discuss things like gaming and stuff. We stayed up late every night for bonfires and I burned lots of marshmallows. A few days in, I took her home and we smashed (we all went to my place and we played Super Smash Bros haha gotem). When she left to go to her home across the country, I gave her a little hug and said goodbye after we exchanged contact information.

We kept in touch, sort of.

I developed feelings for her a year later.

Fast forward to 2019, two days after school ended.

The lead up... At this point I'm in her home city four time zones away. She takes me out for a walk and we go to a gas station / convenience store named after a certain obscure geometric shape that looks a bit like an arrow. For the first time in my life, I buy a certain popular sugary cold drink that almost gives me brain freeze. Blue flavour, of course. So we're walking back through the neighbourhood and I joke about our ""very romantic date"" on the way. We get home and park ourselves at the dining room table and continue being awkward.

The revelation... I tell her there's something I want to do at midnight. I remind her that the month will end (It's June 30) and I want to do something special that I've never done before. She asks ""What,"" and I lift my right arm and wrap it around her shoulders, leaning into her saying ""This is a hint."" She turns and gives me a peck from the right side and tells me ""You're sweet,"" and I'm in shock. I couldn't believe this was really happening. I reveal to her that I felt this way for about a year at this point. She tells me she had an interest for some months. Now I tell her I want to kiss her a second before the month ends, so the kiss lasts from June to July.

The plan... I tell her I'll try to stay up. I live in a time zone 4 hours ahead, and I flew in early so I was awake since 5 AM, which was the equivalent to 1 AM where we were. The goal was to stay up until at least midnight, 23 hours no sleep. That didn't work. I spent the whole day with her until I couldn't think on my own from the fatigue. I ended up telling her to wake me up at 11:45 PM, and I dozed off in the living room. I woke up in darkness to see her standing next to me. It was sensational, seeing her so committed, standing over me while I was on the ground. It was time.

The juicy part... She takes me into her room trying not to wake our parents (by the way we aren't related and we have different parents), and I stop to take out my retainer and brush my teeth because I want this experience to be perfect. Then I strut back in to her isolated space. She encourages me to lie down next to her on the little bed. She wraps her arms around my body and strokes my hair as I do the same to her. I could tell from her tone of voice and her movements, she was really enjoying this. Is it 11:59 yet? Almost. She sees her phone clock hit 11:57. I count 60 seconds in my head and whisper a few of them. 11:58. I refined my timing and counted another minute accurately. 11:59, and I can't contain my excitement. I whisper ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5,"" and I was shaking inside. We make eye contact every so often and it's beautiful. I see her face and she looks as if she wants to kiss me now. ""40, 41, 42,"" I whisper, and she says ""Let's just do it now!"" I stop her for a few seconds, then realize I can probably hold a kiss that long. So we do it. I pull her towards me, and she reaches around and squeezes my body. I can say there and then, there was no space between our open mouths.

The aftermath... The parents walked in and beat me with a cane, just kidding. We stayed there together, in awe of what we just did. ""We did it,"" was all I could muster. I tensed up. ""Is this real? Is this actually happening? Pinch me,"" I say. She pinched my bicep. It hurt. It was real. It actually happened. In a few minutes of shock, I accepted that the best possible thing to happen actually happened. We kissed again and again. She continued to caress me, then she fell asleep in my arms. I stayed there, laying awake for hours. I couldn't sleep as long as we were in physical contact, but I didn't mind. I stayed there until I really needed to go back to bed, and I woke her to say I was going back, and kissed her one more time before resting and continuing our romantic adventure.

Let me tell you what I believe is causing my depression. I have posted here before and here is what I said:

“I feel as if I wasted the best years of my life doing something so dumb I can't stand life anymore. Last summer my group of friends started hanging out with this group of girls and one of them was interested in dating me. I decided not to date her because I was to busy with my business and saw that she was dating a new guy every month and I didn't just want to be just another guy. (BTW she was dating a lot for emotional reasons and not sex)

When I was a kid I was very lonely and didn't have many friends. I was bullied for how I acted and how I looked. I was always pushed around in life and never had the confidence to do anything. When I got into high school I decided to take a stand to this bullshit and started building a business. I worked so hard to build my business and was so obsessed that when something wouldn't go right I would want to end my own life. Now at the end of my senior year my business makes about 60k a year in passive income and I will probably make 100k a year passively in the next couple of years. This would sound great to the old me and to many others but honestly I feel fucking stupid.

Since freshman year I dreamed that senior year would be amazing. I would have a beautiful girlfriend and I could take her to homecoming and prom and have the kind of relationship I would see in the movies. My dream was so big but I felt my hard work could make something like this come true. Well honestly it did and thats what the problem is. The girl that I decided to pass up over the summer started dating a guy that she continued dating all school year up until today. Throughout the school year I had to watch them have the kind of senior year I have always wanted. Now that high school is over I feel like a huge failure. I chased money when I had the perfect girl in front of me the whole time who didn't care about my money or looks and liked me for me. Something much better than anything I could have dreamed of. Sadly I had to watch this die in front of my eyes. I can't believe how stupid I am. I wake up every morning in utter regret for what I have done. Each day gets worse as I think about what could have been to the point where I don't want to live anymore.”

I realized that my depression doesn’t have much to do with her. It was the dream I had that I can now never fulfill. I can never take a girl I like to a dance with my friends and have a great time. I can’t go to those games with a girl I care about. In fact I can’t do anything now because it’s over. I feel as if I never had the time I wanted to in high school and I feel as if I failed. I can’t move on because I have this need to finish what I started and the fact that this dream is dead I feel as if I have died with it. It’s all that mattered to me and now I have nothing besides 4 years of regret. To anyone who comments I know this may sound pointless to you but this was the dream I created and the dream I spent countless hours trying to achieve. All my struggles and successes are in that dream. Hopefully you can understand that if you worked as hard as I did and when you reached the moment when all your hard work was about to pay off you missed your chance and all you had to do was just was just say tell someone you like them and the dream would have been complete. I understand that yes she could have broken my heart but at least I would have got some kind of reward but instead I leave empty handed. The money that I earned means nothing without the dream. Maybe I am crazy for being so depressed and suicidal for not completing what I wanted but please give your honest opinion. Every comment is truly appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone I think something is mentally wrong with me to start.

&lt;p&gt;“I feel as if I wasted the best years of my life doing something so dumb I can&amp;#39;t stand life anymore. Last summer my group of friends started hanging out with this group of girls and one of them was interested in dating me. I decided not to date her because I was to busy with my business and saw that she was dating a new guy every month and I didn&amp;#39;t just want to be just another guy. (BTW she was dating a lot for emotional reasons and not sex)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid I was very lonely and didn&amp;#39;t have many friends. I was bullied for how I acted and how I looked. I was always pushed around in life and never had the confidence to do anything. When I got into high school I decided to take a stand to this bullshit and started building a business. I worked so hard to build my business and was so obsessed that when something wouldn&amp;#39;t go right I would want to end my own life. Now at the end of my senior year my business makes about 60k a year in passive income and I will probably make 100k a year passively in the next couple of years. This would sound great to the old me and to many others but honestly I feel fucking stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since freshman year I dreamed that senior year would be amazing. I would have a beautiful girlfriend and I could take her to homecoming and prom and have the kind of relationship I would see in the movies. My dream was so big but I felt my hard work could make something like this come true. Well honestly it did and thats what the problem is. The girl that I decided to pass up over the summer started dating a guy that she continued dating all school year up until today. Throughout the school year I had to watch them have the kind of senior year I have always wanted. Now that high school is over I feel like a huge failure. I chased money when I had the perfect girl in front of me the whole time who didn&amp;#39;t care about my money or looks and liked me for me. Something much better than anything I could have dreamed of. Sadly I had to watch this die in front of my eyes. I can&amp;#39;t believe how stupid I am. I wake up every morning in utter regret for what I have done. Each day gets worse as I think about what could have been to the point where I don&amp;#39;t want to live anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that my depression doesn’t have much to do with her. It was the dream I had that I can now never fulfill. I can never take a girl I like to a dance with my friends and have a great time. I can’t go to those games with a girl I care about. In fact I can’t do anything now because it’s over. I feel as if I never had the time I wanted to in high school and I feel as if I failed. I can’t move on because I have this need to finish what I started and the fact that this dream is dead I feel as if I have died with it. It’s all that mattered to me and now I have nothing besides 4 years of regret. To anyone who comments I know this may sound pointless to you but this was the dream I created and the dream I spent countless hours trying to achieve. All my struggles and successes are in that dream. Hopefully you can understand that if you worked as hard as I did and when you reached the moment when all your hard work was about to pay off you missed your chance and all you had to do was just was just say tell someone you like them and the dream would have been complete. I understand that yes she could have broken my heart but at least I would have got some kind of reward but instead I leave empty handed. The money that I earned means nothing without the dream. Maybe I am crazy for being so depressed and suicidal for not completing what I wanted but please give your honest opinion. Every comment is truly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

Letting go is hard. Letting go of someone is hard. Letting go of someone you cherished is even harder. Letting go of someone you knew didn’t cherish you enough is unbearable. I know people go through this stuff all the time, but I never thought I’d be one of them. 
Getting so lost in fun, you lose yourself. I never thought I’d lose myself trying to find someone else. I never thought I’d wanna find someone. I never thought I’d wanna find a reason to be with someone. I never thought I’d do these things for you. 
You made me see things in a whole new perspective. You made me feel things in a new perspective. You made me. 
Losing you will hurt, losing apart of me will hurt more. Intertwined on this weird patch of our lives, you were a nobody to me but suddenly became the only person to me. 
How do you care about someone this much? Because you grow with them. 
 I’ve never found a reason to write before, I’ve never found a reason to tell anyone before but you are that someone to change me. But I wasn’t that person to change you. 

I don’t deserve the sleepless nights, I don’t deserve the crying, I don’t deserve the wondering. When you don’t even know why I do these things. 
But hey,
Maybe this is hopeless? Maybe I dug too deep into my own grave? Maybe I was another fuck and run? Maybe we’ll never know? 
I spent so many days scared, but I never thought to myself why I would be scared? 
I’m sorry I was scared and I never told you how I truly felt about you all this time. I don’t think I needed to, when you always knew deep down. I think you were afraid too. 
Endless amounts of sleep LOST trying to figure out math and graphs. ELIMINATING my own work to figure out the answers for you. 
That stuck to me the most, because that’s what I was really doing. Cancelling everything out to figure out something for you. 
I never really cared about myself that much because it’s weird it’s not who I am but once I saw you and how your life was. I started to see myself differently and care about myself differently. I’m glad you did come into my life. I just wish we did everything backwards. But then again when do we ever follow the RULES.

- I wrote this to finally not combust into a thousand pieces of how I felt, to finally let you know. I don’t know if you actually get to read this haha maybe I’ll write it out since it’s more sincere that way. Anyways. To the person who made me slightly different, who made me finally release myself. It’s 3:33pm scary. Feelings are scarier. Maybe you’ll get my letter when you’re already in A—- but I’m not too sure yet.. I don’t know why I keep avoiding to say this but I do love you. I kept trying to brush off my feelings but I don’t think it’s possible. You know I care about you so much. Sex, I could care less about my own pleasure. I got so much pleasure from being with you and getting to know you and your lovely family. I know how much you’ve done for you and your family which amazes me, I know you’re only doing what’s best but it feels so heartbreaking to know I wasn’t apart of that plan this time. I know you aren’t the perfect person but I know deep down you are somewhat something more than perfect. You are D——. Office Depot D——. My goose D—-. D—. Why did mama G—- give you such a name jeez. I don’t know why you’re different now. Why you suddenly just made me disappear, but I’m sorry for whatever I’ve ever done to you. I promise you meant more to me than anybody else has. I’m sorry for all the times I’ve cause stressed. There’s so much more to be sorry about but it’d take forever. You know I’m actually a mess. I wish I could’ve talked to you that day in the car and told you what I’ve been dying to tell you but I think I’d have a panic attack. I know I’ve never been the only one, but you should know to me you’ve been the only person I’ve wanted. I had you, I lost you.

We will just call her “C”. When we were getting our luggage from the airport, my friend had asked me to go with him and talk to this girl he was interested in. At the time I didn’t have any interest in anyone and didn’t have anything better to do so we went over to go see her. Standing next to the girl he was talking about was the girl I haven’t been able to get out of my head for the past 6 years. We went up to them and I introduced myself, then something kind of amazing happened. They looked at each other surprised then looked at her bag and on her bag was a sticker with my name on it. To this day I still think of that as a sign and I always wonder if she does too. Anyway so that’s how we met and we became friends after that but I wanted to be more than that. Throughout the first year of knowing her, we got extremely close. We bonded through her cute “man” voice when she had lost her voice and the movie camp rock. One song in particular actually, from camp rock 2, Introducing me by nick jonas. I promised her that I would learn that song on guitar and sing it to her. So I spent countless nights singing that song and trying to figure it all out and I would send her little parts of the song just so she knew I was trying. I don’t think she ever fully grasped how hard I was trying though..yikes. Anyway, at the end of the first year I told her how I felt and everything and she said she wasn’t ready for a relationship which was understandable because we were young so I just decided I’d wait for her. We stayed friends and the second year nothing too exciting happens. But then high school started and I had lost hope that she would ever really like me back so I started dating for the first two years of high school. Those relationships didn’t really work out even though I gave them everything I could I think when problems started to happen I didn’t try to fix them because I was hoping it wouldn’t work. I still wanted “C”. So junior year comes around and I start really talking to her again and we have a thing for a little bit. During which I held her in my arms while we were on my couch and normally it’s whatever but with her it felt right in its own way. Ps I am not a hugger usually because I find it hard to be emotionally available to people. So holding someone that wasn’t a family member or girlfriend is a big thing for me. Also in this same year, summer before junior year of high school, we made bracelets. Well, at least she helped me make my bracelet because I’m not very good at it. In any case, I told her I was never going to take it off unless it breaks. Fast forward a summer, I still have the bracelet and I have some of my friends over who are trying to take a pillow from me (Two of my close friends that are female). They can’t do it but one of them clips my bracket and breaks it. This actually like gave me a pain in my stomach and I got very upset for the day but I didn’t want to make my friends feel bad so I just tired it to my backpack and told “C” that we needed to make a new one. So we meet make a new one and then something happens that nobody thought would. The friend group that had stood the test of time, started drifting apart. We all had jobs that started getting in our way and new friend groups. So now senior year starts and I’m still talking to “C” and I’m still head over heels for this girl but she doesn’t know the extent of what I feel. After I told her how I felt, we started talking more again until I found out my best friend since preschool liked her too. This was a crushing moment but we agreed we should all just be friends. He has a very short attention span and really is just looking for anyone who will give him attention so she wasn’t anything special to him and he moved on from that moment. For me though, this was different and I still haven’t moved on. Now it’s the summer after senior year, I haven’t talked to her since school so I decided to text her. I sent her a picture of the bracelet and told her this one was getting pretty tight on me and I might need a new one. I get a text back and we start talking. I ask her what’s up and how’s everything going, only to find out she has a boyfriend who isn’t going to the same college as she is and they’ll be in different states completely. I don’t know if they plan on staying together or what and I haven’t met him so I don’t know what their relationship is like. I still have butterflies when she says my name or I see her name show up on my phone and I have never once seen anything negative about her. I leave in two weeks and I almost don’t want to see her before I leave because that’s the hardest goodbye I’ll have to give. I don’t know if I’ll tell her that I still feel this way or not because I don’t think she has even thought about me as anything more than a friend in a while. Sorry for the book, I needed to express myself a little.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I met this girl 6 years ago on a school trip and honestly that’s where it starts.

To this day I still think of that as a sign and I always wonder if she does too. Anyway so that’s how we met and we became friends after that but I wanted to be more than that. Throughout the first year of knowing her, we got extremely close. We bonded through her cute “man” voice when she had lost her voice and the movie camp rock. One song in particular actually, from camp rock 2, Introducing me by nick jonas. I promised her that I would learn that song on guitar and sing it to her. So I spent countless nights singing that song and trying to figure it all out and I would send her little parts of the song just so she knew I was trying. I don’t think she ever fully grasped how hard I was trying though..yikes. Anyway, at the end of the first year I told her how I felt and everything and she said she wasn’t ready for a relationship which was understandable because we were young so I just decided I’d wait for her. We stayed friends and the second year nothing too exciting happens. But then high school started and I had lost hope that she would ever really like me back so I started dating for the first two years of high school. Those relationships didn’t really work out even though I gave them everything I could I think when problems started to happen I didn’t try to fix them because I was hoping it wouldn’t work. I still wanted “C”. So junior year comes around and I start really talking to her again and we have a thing for a little bit. During which I held her in my arms while we were on my couch and normally it’s whatever but with her it felt right in its own way. Ps I am not a hugger usually because I find it hard to be emotionally available to people. So holding someone that wasn’t a family member or girlfriend is a big thing for me. Also in this same year, summer before junior year of high school, we made bracelets. Well, at least she helped me make my bracelet because I’m not very good at it. In any case, I told her I was never going to take it off unless it breaks. Fast forward a summer, I still have the bracelet and I have some of my friends over who are trying to take a pillow from me (Two of my close friends that are female). They can’t do it but one of them clips my bracket and breaks it. This actually like gave me a pain in my stomach and I got very upset for the day but I didn’t want to make my friends feel bad so I just tired it to my backpack and told “C” that we needed to make a new one. So we meet make a new one and then something happens that nobody thought would. The friend group that had stood the test of time, started drifting apart. We all had jobs that started getting in our way and new friend groups. So now senior year starts and I’m still talking to “C” and I’m still head over heels for this girl but she doesn’t know the extent of what I feel. After I told her how I felt, we started talking more again until I found out my best friend since preschool liked her too. This was a crushing moment but we agreed we should all just be friends. He has a very short attention span and really is just looking for anyone who will give him attention so she wasn’t anything special to him and he moved on from that moment. For me though, this was different and I still haven’t moved on. Now it’s the summer after senior year, I haven’t talked to her since school so I decided to text her. I sent her a picture of the bracelet and told her this one was getting pretty tight on me and I might need a new one. I get a text back and we start talking. I ask her what’s up and how’s everything going, only to find out she has a boyfriend who isn’t going to the same college as she is and they’ll be in different states completely. I don’t know if they plan on staying together or what and I haven’t met him so I don’t know what their relationship is like. I still have butterflies when she says my name or I see her name show up on my phone and I have never once seen anything negative about her. I leave in two weeks and I almost don’t want to see her before I leave because that’s the hardest goodbye I’ll have to give. I don’t know if I’ll tell her that I still feel this way or not because I don’t think she has even thought about me as anything more than a friend in a while. Sorry for the book, I needed to express myself a little.&lt;/p&gt;

There's this girl that I like who's now basically my bestfriend/soulmate (I'm 17 and she's 15) since we're so similar in most of our taste and basically almost every aspect of our lives that's why we got close. Anyways I have a huge crush on her for a few months now. We would talk to each other all day and all night, have video calls (tho im the one who initiates the convos and video calls on messenger usually) but all's good. A few weeks ago we watched Far From Home and it was basically out first date where it's actually our first time to meet up  (let me note that we have no label and aren't in a romantic relationship)  so it was awkward as fuck at first but eventually the tension disappeared then throughout the movie we chatted a lot and she keeps on clinging to me on the ""extreme and emotional parts"" where she'd just lean on my shoulder and grab my shirt and hit me. It continued for a while until the movie ended. Then we went to the arcade to play and lots of playful teasing and weird convos involved. Roamed the mall for the entire afternoon before going home. We have couple of nicknames for each other btw. But aren't all close friends like this? I really don't want to keep my hopes up. She would constantly nag me to not do stupid shit and all. She's been there for me emotionally. We always shower each other with support and encouragement. 


So that's it. Idk if it's just purely platonic or something more. Let me note that im a butch lesbian (could easily pass off as a guy lmao) and she's bi. Im really confused im not used to this kind of shit you know? Im a shy, awkward type of gay. What do you guys think? Should I elaborate even more? I'm in my awkward, confused teenager phase rn so I could definitely use some help.

I want to win her over. But the only thing that makes me hesitate to go all the way is the fact that we're now relatives after my uncle remarried another woman who happens to be her aunt. We're now basically a family, I guess? But this one's another issue tho. We both love to flirt (?) around and talk.

In the windy days, wind will lead your way.

Never gonna walk away.

Jim was worried that he might not be able to learn all the necessary topics in time and had to postpone the exams once again.

He was not in a very good mood, he focused on one of the empty seats in the middle of the lecture room. ""Excuse me, may I go through?"" he asked one of the anonymous students. The student stood up and said ""of course"", a quick quite ""thank you"" hushed through Jim's lips as he passed by.

He sat down and put in his earphones to relax his mind and build up focus for the last lecture. Jim was a single 23 year old guy, struggling with his studies although this was one his favorite science fields. The mathematics behind the methods were just too difficult for him to comprehend, he wanted to know everything and knowing the little time they were given to prepare for exams it saddened him that he had to just focus on passing the exams instead of actually learning. At least that is what he thought and believed.

Right before the lecture started, a girl tapped on Jim's shoulders and asked ""Is this seat empty?"", Jim surprised by the fact that a girl was talking to him tried to keep his posture and said with a calm but stuttery voice ""yes, it is free."". She sat down next to him. Jim noticed her sweet parfume. ""That smell. It seems to be in nowadays"" he thought to himself. The lecture began and both went on carefully listening to the lecturer, hoping to catch even the slightest hints for the upcoming exam. They helped each other when they didn't hear or couldn't read something occasionally.

Jim felt almost sad that the lecture ended. He knew this wasn't considered as spending time with someone, but her sitting next to him somehow made Jim feel more comfortable yet also nervous at the same time, anxious for making a wrong move. Anyways, he never knew how to approach girls so just as always he thought about focusing on getting home as quickly as possible to study.

Jim's mind was convoluted with all sorts of different thoughts, just as usual. ""Talk to her"" said the one voice, the other countered ""No, you will harass and annoy her. Even if you talk, what are you going to talk about, huh?"". Jim was torn in between his thoughts.

Ann, the girl who sat next to Jim during this lecture had also mixed thoughts. ""Talk to him."" said one voice, the other voice countered as well ""No, what if he doesn't like you? Surely he is taken and don't want to hang around with you. Besides, you are not even wearing anything exciting or have make up on. He will find you ugly!""

Jim and Ann were both fighting with their inner-selves while waiting for the other students to get up and make room for them to leave.

Although the students took more time than usual to free up the way, it went too quick from Jim's point of view. As he reached the entrance and was about to go home he turned around one last time to see what Ann is up to. He saw her going her way but she was moving slowly. He sighed and went on his way. 

Ann was about go home too but she was still unsure to talk to Jim. She finally had the thought to ask him to study together.

M was 15 when her little brother John was killed by a killer called David but that wasn't it her dad was in on it and her mother knew about it but didn't do a single shit, because M was an amazing student she became bf with the supervisor that is soon to be principal to the point where she told her everything and one day she said ""I know this is Wierd but my mother is a psycho she knew about the killer who killed John and didn't  do anything and I can't prove it, I need serious help!"" the supervisor thought and said ""I will adopt u"" M looked at her in shock and said ""will u?"" and the supervisor responded with ""of course"".
A couple weeks later and M was adopted and she started to sleep in the dorms in which she never slept there cause her mother would never allow it, M started to learn self defense privately in the school on holidays to the point where the principal gave her a think l gun and told her ""I need to protect students and the school and of course keep it a secret"" M was really happy and agreed at once.
M was always bullied since her brother died cause since then she was down and alot people called her ""lame"" M was bothered but showed no attention. After a while she started being more cheerful so 5 new boys came to school the principal told the students about them and they were greeted she was searching for M so she can give one of them a tour around the school's property then M came rushing, the supervisor called her and she said "" I have to go"" she was so fast that the new kids couldn't see her face all they saw was a running girl.
At night the students would sit in the lounge, after a while someone came and said ""who would like to help in designing the gym for the party"" M was the first to join then the new kid asked ""is that the girl that ran?"" and one of the other students said ""yes"".
When the students were finishing up Caleb (M's bully) came up to her and said ""WOW u are here after ur brother died"" *throws the jug of fruit punch* all of the students were shocked but they still laughed, M didn't want to fight with them because the principal said so, M decided to leave without a word.
The party started and they were going to close the doors when M came in hot 😉 walking to her friends at the bar Caleb came and said ""oh hey.... U lookin good today"" gave her a drink she took it, said thank u, threw the drink in his face then she went to her friends (Lia, Mia, dede) , everyone turned from hating M to crushin on her. 
The party was over but the fun wasn't, there was an after party at lia's house.
M went and got the car while the girls were getting their things, M kept waiting and honking but they didn't come out, when they did dede tripped but Richard (one of the new kids) held her before she fell, M saw her and ran out of the car to help her and told the other girls to get her things and she will take her to the car, M said ""thx"" and left. 
They went to the after party and M found some people suspicious she followed them then she knew what gang they were in the middle of the party she shot 2 of them then a 3rd came and pushed her to the floor and she pushed him ran and shit him then she trapped the 4th one and asked him ""what is the gang's location?"" he told her the name of the store and the alleyway, she started walking and he said ""u won't let me go?"" she turned around and said ""no b***h"". *shoots him in the head*When she was leaving she found out that the door was locked and windows as well, then a guy came and guess what it was David when she saw she got her gun out then all of his men showed up and he said ""still wanna shoot me and kill all these people?"" she puts her gun down ""look I mean no harm, all I want is to finish unfinished business"" M was confused and said ""what business?"" he looks at her, laughs and said ""the day your brother died was a mistake he wasn't suppose to die it was u who was gonna die but you sent your brother to get the mop instead of u so technically u did it...... YOU KILLED HIM"" M stood still just shocked while he said ""I will give u the choice, either u shoot yourself or I shoot the others"" M took the gun, pointed it on her head and seconds before she pulls the trigger her mother came, took the gun pointed it at herself and that moment the trigger was pulled and her mother's gang barged in and shot David and his gang but David wasn't  dead yet,(he was shot in his shoulder) then Lia's mother passed in front of M and said ""stay away from my daughter"" and followed her Dede, Mia and thier moms, M looked at them while she was in pain then she suddenly reached out for the gun, ran to David while he was in pain on the floor and shot him 6 times while crying until Jones came and held her from her back in which her hands were held tight, pulled her back, and on the floor they fell, then Jones's friends Isra and Roni CAME (they are from her mother's gang but will start to go to the same school as M) , isra was sitting on the opposite side of Jones while Roni was in M's face calming her down, but no matter what, whatever happened in this room cannot be undone. 
M wasnt suppose to go to school for a couple of months after what happened, but after only a month M came into a school like she owns it, I can say that everyones' Jaws dropped (she started wearing a black leather jacket, tight black leggings and high heels) M walked in theiddlw of the hall stoped and looked at Lia, Mia and Dede and completed like a strong woman then she reached her friends Jones, Isra and Roni and all of them went to the lounge because that day was holiday.
After Caleb saw M fighting and shooting u think he would stop but he went further, he entered the lounge with his friends and said ""M girl we missed u, I actually didn't 😂😂 what was your feeling knowing that u killed your brother"" M got up and stood right in face and said ""I CAN EXPOSE YOU"" Caleb looked at her and said ""ha u got something on me"" M replied ""If u forgot let me remind u"" and she gave him the dirtiest look u will ever see, at that moment the supervisor barged in and said ""WHAT IS HAPPENING?"" no one talked then Caleb said ""M is blackmailing me"" M said ""am I?"", ""YOU ARE!"" said Caleb, the supervisor stoped them and said ""both of u will say what happened but let us start with M"" M says ""He came up to me making fun of my brother then got up the thing that I am the reason for his death *she looks at Caleb and completes saying* I did nothing and why do u have to always make me the bad guy everyday every minute ever second, JUST STOP, I AM NOT THE BAD GUY IF THERE IS A BAD GUY HERE THEN IT IS U CALEB, U ARE THE ONE WHO STALKED ME AND BLACKMAILED ME WITH THE PICTURES U TOOK OF ME IN MY OWN HOUSE, U STALKED ME AND I HAVE THE FOOTAGE OF U OUTSIDE OF MY HOUSE, u thought I deleted them ha I didn't, I am not that stupid"" The whole school was speechless and the supervisor said ""to my office Caleb!"" M ran out of the lounge and the new kid ran behind her, he screamed ""M"" she looked behind her and he said ""I am..."" she completed ""Alex, I know everyones' names"" he put his hand on her shoulder and said ""don't listen to anything he said"" M started crying and mumbling ""I killed him.... I killed my brother😭"" he hugged her and said ""u didn't"" over and over again.
The next day of school no one saw M nor Alex since"" the hug"", the school finished exams early and had 4 months left, the supervisor allowed the students to not have lessons but must stay on school property until they get permission from the ministry, a month past and they got the permission so the principal gathered all the students in the assembly field and said ""we got the permission for u to leave but what u don't know is your activity scores weren't entered so let's enter them, shall we?..."" the supervisor completed ""we shall, u will go to apartments that we rented for u and u will get to share a room with someone from this...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;M is a 16 year old that has ALOT of problems with family, life and friends, here is her background.

They went to the after party and M found some people suspicious she followed them then she knew what gang they were in the middle of the party she shot 2 of them then a 3rd came and pushed her to the floor and she pushed him ran and shit him then she trapped the 4th one and asked him &amp;quot;what is the gang&amp;#39;s location?&amp;quot; he told her the name of the store and the alleyway, she started walking and he said &amp;quot;u won&amp;#39;t let me go?&amp;quot; she turned around and said &amp;quot;no b**&lt;em&gt;h&amp;quot;. *shoots him in the head&lt;/em&gt;When she was leaving she found out that the door was locked and windows as well, then a guy came and guess what it was David when she saw she got her gun out then all of his men showed up and he said &amp;quot;still wanna shoot me and kill all these people?&amp;quot; she puts her gun down &amp;quot;look I mean no harm, all I want is to finish unfinished business&amp;quot; M was confused and said &amp;quot;what business?&amp;quot; he looks at her, laughs and said &amp;quot;the day your brother died was a mistake he wasn&amp;#39;t suppose to die it was u who was gonna die but you sent your brother to get the mop instead of u so technically u did it...... YOU KILLED HIM&amp;quot; M stood still just shocked while he said &amp;quot;I will give u the choice, either u shoot yourself or I shoot the others&amp;quot; M took the gun, pointed it on her head and seconds before she pulls the trigger her mother came, took the gun pointed it at herself and that moment the trigger was pulled and her mother&amp;#39;s gang barged in and shot David and his gang but David wasn&amp;#39;t  dead yet,(he was shot in his shoulder) then Lia&amp;#39;s mother passed in front of M and said &amp;quot;stay away from my daughter&amp;quot; and followed her Dede, Mia and thier moms, M looked at them while she was in pain then she suddenly reached out for the gun, ran to David while he was in pain on the floor and shot him 6 times while crying until Jones came and held her from her back in which her hands were held tight, pulled her back, and on the floor they fell, then Jones&amp;#39;s friends Isra and Roni CAME (they are from her mother&amp;#39;s gang but will start to go to the same school as M) , isra was sitting on the opposite side of Jones while Roni was in M&amp;#39;s face calming her down, but no matter what, whatever happened in this room cannot be undone. 
M wasnt suppose to go to school for a couple of months after what happened, but after only a month M came into a school like she owns it, I can say that everyones&amp;#39; Jaws dropped (she started wearing a black leather jacket, tight black leggings and high heels) M walked in theiddlw of the hall stoped and looked at Lia, Mia and Dede and completed like a strong woman then she reached her friends Jones, Isra and Roni and all of them went to the lounge because that day was holiday.
After Caleb saw M fighting and shooting u think he would stop but he went further, he entered the lounge with his friends and said &amp;quot;M girl we missed u, I actually didn&amp;#39;t 😂😂 what was your feeling knowing that u killed your brother&amp;quot; M got up and stood right in face and said &amp;quot;I CAN EXPOSE YOU&amp;quot; Caleb looked at her and said &amp;quot;ha u got something on me&amp;quot; M replied &amp;quot;If u forgot let me remind u&amp;quot; and she gave him the dirtiest look u will ever see, at that moment the supervisor barged in and said &amp;quot;WHAT IS HAPPENING?&amp;quot; no one talked then Caleb said &amp;quot;M is blackmailing me&amp;quot; M said &amp;quot;am I?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;YOU ARE!&amp;quot; said Caleb, the supervisor stoped them and said &amp;quot;both of u will say what happened but let us start with M&amp;quot; M says &amp;quot;He came up to me making fun of my brother then got up the thing that I am the reason for his death &lt;em&gt;she looks at Caleb and completes saying&lt;/em&gt; I did nothing and why do u have to always make me the bad guy everyday every minute ever second, JUST STOP, I AM NOT THE BAD GUY IF THERE IS A BAD GUY HERE THEN IT IS U CALEB, U ARE THE ONE WHO STALKED ME AND BLACKMAILED ME WITH THE PICTURES U TOOK OF ME IN MY OWN HOUSE, U STALKED ME AND I HAVE THE FOOTAGE OF U OUTSIDE OF MY HOUSE, u thought I deleted them ha I didn&amp;#39;t, I am not that stupid&amp;quot; The whole school was speechless and the supervisor said &amp;quot;to my office Caleb!&amp;quot; M ran out of the lounge and the new kid ran behind her, he screamed &amp;quot;M&amp;quot; she looked behind her and he said &amp;quot;I am...&amp;quot; she completed &amp;quot;Alex, I know everyones&amp;#39; names&amp;quot; he put his hand on her shoulder and said &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t listen to anything he said&amp;quot; M started crying and mumbling &amp;quot;I killed him.... I killed my brother😭&amp;quot; he hugged her and said &amp;quot;u didn&amp;#39;t&amp;quot; over and over again.
The next day of school no one saw M nor Alex since&amp;quot; the hug&amp;quot;, the school finished exams early and had 4 months left, the supervisor allowed the students to not have lessons but must stay on school property until they get permission from the ministry, a month past and they got the permission so the principal gathered all the students in the assembly field and said &amp;quot;we got the permission for u to leave but what u don&amp;#39;t know is your activity scores weren&amp;#39;t entered so let&amp;#39;s enter them, shall we?...&amp;quot; the supervisor completed &amp;quot;we shall, u will go to apartments that we rented for u and u will get to share a room with someone from this...&lt;/p&gt;

She breathes in, then out, in slow motions, letting her mind roam free. She turns, seeing the arrow come towards her, and with a leap, and a quick kick in the air, she’s off the horse, arrow in hand. And she hollered, loud enough for her attacker to know to never attack once more.

He’s draped over the desk, his pen scribbling on the paper heavily and his brow furrowed. “Go fetch your Mother for me will you?” he barks out, treating me like a servant. “Father, I was going to go see the king.” I say, stopping in the doorway. “Fine.” He says with a huff, and reaches behind him to pull the bell to alert the servants.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok so I’m gonna be writing a novel through reddit, and it may go on for a loooong time so I mean, enjoy yourselves?&lt;/p&gt;

My whole life has been a complete mess. 
From 14 - 22 I've been pretty much locked away from the world. 
Never being able to have friends, true love, a girlfriend.. I had a career forced on me, and though I passed my apprenticeship, the qualifications I got were meaningless in the real world, as I just couldn't work there. Because I couldnt stop getting these panic attacks and tremors, I felt so claustrophobic working there. 

At 23 I started a business in the only thing I could ( gardening ) I'm very physically fit and have a fit body ( who cares). I'm very busy and I work all the time now. I'm out alot. 
But that's where it ends.. who cares.. 

I can't enjoy my life, I can't eat in public, or go to bars, I haven't ever had a friend in years. I need true love. It's all I need. And no one will love me. I want to find my true love and love them. But nothing ever happens. 

Life keeps showing me a glimmer of hope, of what I could have, and then it snatches it away. It's so cruel. And all lies.

I'm just totally not allowed to have that. 

Even if I had millions of pounds, It wouldn't matter. I've gone too long alone. Even all my penpals I had, left me. 

I wrote a suicide note yesterday, and I tried to cut my wrists when everyone was out, but I couldn't stab the razor deep enough to do the job. 

Though I dont bother with ""help"". In the past I've been on every medication to help me, I don't need psychological help, it's a load donkey s**t in my opinion. Im not going back to them. They don't help you. There bad. 

I've had my life stolen from me, and no one cares when your damaged goods. I guess, who wants to love someone that can't go out and enjoy themselves?
No one. 

My family want me gone. 
The world wants me gone. 

I just cry alot in the night when I realise how I can be so lonely and that no one has ever wanted me or loved me.

The only reason I'm not on drugs is because I haven't got any contacts to get any. 

I need some joy in my life.. 

And if I sound selfish, then I guess I deserve to be alone because I've got things wrong with me. Even though I'm just being myself and going with the flow.

(I have worked through a lot of stuff sense then and I now know that at the time I was really craving friendship and an escape from loneliness. But at the time, I had that confused with needing/wanting a boyfriend) . 

I joined an app. Set up my profile. Swiped through some prospects. I found a guy. He was cute and we matched. I sent him a funny message and suddenly the ice was broken. 

We talked for awhile about simple stuff like how our day was going and what we planned to do after college. One day I was in class and we were snapping back and forth. It got a little flirty and long story short he asked me if I wanted to have dinner at his house that night. I said yes. 

We meet up and I was so surprised at how handsome he really was. I couldn't believe he wanted to talk to a girl like me. I was beyond nervous. We have dinner and get to know each other a bit more. He asked me why I was on the app and I said that I really didn't know, mostly just curious. So I asked him and he said he wasn't looking for a girlfriend at the moment. Mostly just trying to date. 

I wasn't exactly hurt by that because we had literally just met that day. After dinner we suddenly ended up on his bed listening to music and making out. He asked me if I wanted to have sex and I told him no. Part of me was really starting to like him and I didn't want to mess it up by having sex right away. He asked me why, and for some reason my spazzy brain decided to make a joke and say, I'm waiting until marriage. 

It totally killed the mood but....I never told him that I was joking. I dont know why. I just said it and kept it out there. He took me home and asked me on another date in a few days. My heart was so excited because I thought I had messed it up. 

A few days later we go for lunch and he did a complete 180. He barely smiled at me, our conversations were empty and it actually ""felt"" like he didn't want to be there. When he brought me back home I tried to goof around with him a little and he was not having it. After that date he ghosted me. I wasn't heartbroken because I barely knew him but for some reason that brief situation we had stuck with me. 

Fast forward 5 months to now. I just moved into a new place with some people I met through a roommate match service. Me and one other girl were moving in around the same time but oddly enough we kept missing each other because of school and work. 

One day I woke up from a really late nap and walked into the kitchen and saw a familiar looking jacket hanging by the door. You guessed it. 

My new roommate was the girlfriend of the guy I met from the dating app a few months back. I was filled with anxiety and hid immediately as they came into the room. After that day.  All she talks about is how sweet he is to her. How he cooks for her and refuses to let her clean. How he introduced her to his parents after 5 days of knowing each other. 

She always goes around the house basically on my shoulder all the time like my boyfriend always wants me to check in with him so he knows I got home safe. He screenshots my funny pictures I send him. He is so amazing. 

I know he was never my boyfriend and we were barely anything. But back then. It was like he treated me completely differently and for some stupid reason it has me looking back at that time wondering. What is so different about her. Why couldn't you have been that person for me? Did I do something wrong?

I dont know. Maybe because this odd and weird situation has come back and I have a front row seat for it, that it's making me have issues with my self worth.

It's partly to get it all out on the table and in another part to see what others might have to say. I'm not used to Reddit and have usually just looked at the posts of others, so this is my first real post. I'll start this story chronologically as I feel it is easiest for readers to understand that way. I guess it is relevant to share that at the time of writing this, I am a 22 year old male.

&amp;#x200B;

It was the first week of June, 2014. I was 17 years old and only a few months away from being 18. All of my friends were a few years older than me, so they had graduated high school a few years ahead of me and went on to go to college together. Luckily for me, I kept up with them in the summer time: This summer had something special in store, and right at the start. We had planned for months to go to an anime convention and according to my research it was quite a popular annual affair for the anime nerdy types like myself. For my friends, it was their third or second time, but it was my first to this convention (or any convention for that matter). We drove 6 hours to get to the city where the convention was hosted and all crammed into a shitty little Red Roof Inn that was 10 mins from the convention site.

&amp;#x200B;

The day before the convention, I discovered that it was customary to get your badge so when the convention started you wouldn't have to wait through the first panels. At the eve of the convention opening there was a masquerade ball and I decided I would like to go, but my friends lacked my interest. Feeling that I was an independent and mature 17 year old (what 17 year old doesn't think they're mature?), I went on my own. I had never been to any sort of formal dance, so it sounded interesting to say the least, but that sort of thing had always caught my eye. I bought a mask in advance to coming to the convention and made sure to bring my only suit. I had the guys drop me off at the convention venue (a really ritzy and large hotel) and inside I went. A lot of the patrons were in cosplay or anime themed gowns, which was really fun to see.It was something new and I loved it, though it didn't play as much ballroom/waltz music as I expected or would have liked. I was lucky that they played a few 40s styled swing dance songs (I am a history major and I love the music from the 20s, 30s, and 40s in the U.S.).  I am a strange person in  that I am not initially outgoing when introduced to new people, but once the ball is rolling I am very outgoing, so I had a rough time finding a partner to dance. I'm only 5 Ft. 9 In. and very agile and thin. I've since put on some muscle, but back at the time I looked something close to Steve Rogers before Dr. Erskine's super soldier serum. Luckily I wasn't quite as bad as Steve Rogers, but you get my point.

&amp;#x200B;

I had made friends with a group of strangers, most of which did not know eachother prior to the masquerade ball. We danced to the modern pop music together and broke the ice.  Briefly the group split up to get drinks and due to my social success I was feeling a little more confident. A song I know very well came on, and in fact I had placed it upon the request list. The song was ""In the Mood"" by Glenn Miller, so I searched for a partner.

&amp;#x200B;

That was when I saw her. She had beautiful long auburn hair with blue eyes that seemed to peer into my soul. Her slender curves were complimented by a quaint emerald gown. From behind her gown I could see she was wearing the tale of a fox as a sort of cosplay item. She smirked at me with a confident gaze and my heart melted away nearly instantly. I was never used to that type of attention for a woman, so I glanced over my should to see if was looking at someone more sightly behind me. To my surprise, she was looking and smiling at me and by the time I turned back to face her she was approaching. As she stood before me, I was relieved to see that I had half an inch on her. She asked me if I would like to dance with her, and nervously I said yes. She asked if I liked to swing dance, and I gave her an answer in the affirmative. She and I began to swing dance at a comfortable pace; looking back, I can tell she was trying to gauge how comfortable I was. Once she saw that I knew how to swing dance, she picked up the pace and it was honestly impressive. I had taught myself how to swing dance, so I wasn't used to having such a skilled partner. She was still better than me, but I held my own. We worked so well together, that a crowd had formed around us to watch as we tore up the floor with our mad skills.

&amp;#x200B;

The song had ended and quickly the crowd dissipated because the DJ put on a slow dance song. She and I were out of breath and looked at eachother. She didn't even ask at this point, she grabbed my hands and places them upon her waist as she stepped closer to me. We shared that dance as we caught our breath, and I was uncertain how to proceed. Luckily for me, she took charge. She asked for my name, and I gave it to her. I asked for hers, and she told me it was ""Foxy"". I chuckled at the pseudonym, not because it was funny, but at the irony. Foxes were my favorite animal. Once I explained the coincidence, she chuckled too. I asked her this time, ""What's your real name?"" She told me that I would have to wait until midnight to find out when everyone took their masks off.  If she was trying to pique my interest, she had hit her mark. From this point onward, she and I spent the rest of the masquerade together. I introduced her to the other group of friends I had made that night. The masquerade ball proceeded with lots of dancing and fun.

&amp;#x200B;

After several hours of new friends and dancing, the ball drew to a close and our group of 5 people decided we weren't quite ready to call it quits. So we decided to go to IHOP and have some late night breakfast. I sat across from Foxy, who was just as stunning without her mask on. Throughout the meal and conversations, I caught her eyeing me and at other times she would catch me eyeing her. As we talked as a group, Foxy and I discovered that we had a lot of anime, music, and gaming interests in common. As we finished our meals, we exchanged numbers and decided to get some sleep before the start of the con the next day. I had arranged for my friends to pick me up at the IHOP and to the shitty Red Roof Inn I returned. Throughout the night Foxy and I texted eachother where she shared her real name. I'll call her Ella for the sake of anonymity. She and I had spent the rest of the night texting one another about what panels we wanted to go to together. I learned that 'Ella' was 21.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dawn of a New Day**

&amp;#x200B;

The first day of the con. I put on my first cosplay, and boy was I excited. I cosplayed a military alchemist from Fullmetal Alchemist. I don't have the natural haircolor to call myself Roy Mustang. I met up with 'Ella' at the con and we started out by going to a dancing instructional panel. We quickly found out we already knew what they had to offer and moved on. We looked at all the neat cosplays as we wondered to the dealers hall and artist's alley. We explored both to both the wares of all the artists and vendors and this lasted several hours. We then decided to find some food, and the hotel which hosted the con was very overpriced. We went across the street to a Denny's due to it's proximity, and it seemed many con-goers were onto the same idea as it was packed. I wish I had more noteworthy details to share about this day, but honestly it went by so quickly and with all the new sights it is hard explain everything. At the very least I can say I had a fantastic time. That evening there was a rave at which it seemed most of the con-goers were anticipated to attend. Of course, 'Ella' and met up and danced away until 4 in the morning. The tightly packed room proved instrumental for shoving us into one another in the chaos of the rave. It made for some good sexual tension, that's for sure. The tension built, but as 4 AM arrived, we retreated back to our respective hotels.

&amp;#x200B;

Another day and with it I brought another cosplay. It was a friend's costume that didn't fit him anymore, but it fit me perfectly. It was Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad from the first Assassin's Creed game. I wasn't a die hard fan, but I did very much like the first few installments of the series. I rocked that costume and 'Ella' seemed to thoroughly enjoy it as well. She was an aspiring photographer and artist and she was determined to catch some good photos of my cosplay. We spent the day together again and that night was yet another rave. Just as the previous night, we had one helluva time and the sexual tension peaked. We left the rave early and met up at a park. She picked the location as she was from the area and I was not (in hindsight, perhaps it wasn't a good idea to meet someone I just met at a discreet location at night, but hey. She wasn't an axe murderer so who cares, right?). At the park we talked for several hours about our lives, hopes, dreams, hobbies, and interests. The night ended with a passionate make out session between the two of us and it felt genuine. I had borrowed a friends car to see her, so once we decided it was time we drove back to our respective places (for me, the shitty Red Roof Inn).

&amp;#x200B;

**Dawn of the Final Day**

&amp;#x200B;

It was the last day of the con, and it was a half day. We spent as much time together as possible as we recognized that our time to part was fast approaching. I wanted to see the artists' alley and vendors' hall one last time as I heard there would be sales as it was the last day. The day seemed to have gone by very quickly and before we knew it the con was over. My friends and I decided we would leave the following morning, some of my friends had even left that night.

&amp;#x200B;

'Ella' and I continued to text eachother from our difficult parting at the con earlier that day, and decided we couldn't part like that. She came to meet me at my hotel and I saw her outside. You might think it's cheesy, but we made out on the hood of her car on the outskirts of the parking lot. We didn't have a whole lot of options, as for reasons I don't entirely recall, we couldn't go to her place. Well the make out became quite heated and a certain point arrived that we decided we wanted to go somewhere more private. My friend very kindly let his car, so 'Ella' and I found somewhere discreet to park. We made out again, but this time it continued into something further. We had passionate sex in the back of my friends car, and then cuddled for awhile. It was 4 AM when we decided we needed to part again. Before we parted, we made it official that we would try to make long distance work.

&amp;#x200B;

I came back to the shitty Red Roof Inn and slept for a few hours before the long drive home. Luckily I didn't have to drive for most of it. Were I not excited to text 'Ella"", I would have slept the whole trip home.

&amp;#x200B;

A month passes by and 'Ella' and I Skype'd (because it was 2014) every day. I had fallen hard for this woman, she was beautiful, kind, funny, nerdy (like me), and always optimistic. She was a free spirit who had simple dreams to be a photographer who traveled in a Jeep across the country. My own dreams were to be someone of importance: To be someone worth remembering. My aspirations were to become an officer in the United States Air Force and hopefully fly (I am still in fierce pursuit of this dream today, and it's going well despite the inevitable roadblocks). Our dreams didn't quite coincide together, but we lived over 200 miles apart as it was and neither of were ever close to reaching our dream yet. My hope was that if we lasted that long, we would cross that bridge when we go to it. We were both very supportive of eachother and it was a genuinely happy time for me. My only longing was to see her in person again.

&amp;#x200B;

A month into our relationship and such an opportunity arises. My grandfather (I was raised by my grandparents) had a business trip in the area which 'Ella' lived, and he needed me to help him. He was picking up a vehicle from a dealership and he needed someone (myself) to help him drive the second vehicle. Well, while in the area I 'got lost' and met up with 'Ella'. Our visit lasted 45 minutes, and they went by so soon. We passionately made out at our reunion, all in the back of a new vehicle. My grandfather was calling to 'help' me navigate to his location for lunch and we knew our reunion was short lived. I wore a button-up red, green, and brown plaid shirt over a t-shirt with the buttons unbuttoned. She asked to keep my overshirt because it smelled like me and I obliged.

&amp;#x200B;

Our visit was short and that was bitter for 'Ella' and I. Two weeks passed without event or change in behavior. I was almost 18, but as much as I wouldn't like to admit it at the time, I was a kid. As such, I was a faithful Boy Scout (Eagle Scout in fact) and I was in attendance to a high adventure camp in the Colorado area. The trip featured white water rafting and an over night backpacking trip. The location of the camp had shit service and I religiously searched for all the spots I could have reception to reach 'Ella'. I messaged her as frequently as I could and into the late hours of the night, standing in the most awkward places as it was the only place I had reception. I shared with her the highlights of my trip and she would share with me the highlights of her day. Well the week had passed and it was time to go home and by the time I finally had a steady reception things took a nose dive for me.

&amp;#x200B;

'Ella' messaged me on Skype where she said she wanted to talk about something, and I knew something was amiss. Who doesn't get nervous at those words? She said that she wanted to break up with me because she felt that I deserved something better. I told her that I wanted to be with her, but she insisted. Dejectedly, I conceded after my brief resistance to the notion of breaking up. The time we shared together was precious to me, and I didn't want to lose her entirely. My only request was that we still be friends at which she obliged.

&amp;#x200B;

Time had passed without talking, at least a month. I figured she needed distance, and I wasn't sure I couldn't make things weird so I stayed way. I figured she would talk to me when she was ready, but I was mistaken. Figuring that a month was an appropriate time already, I tried to reach out to her and found that she had removed me from social media and Skype. I was obviously sad, but what could I do? I sat and watched from a distance at her Facebook. It took about two months or so for her to find someone else, and I found that to be normal. I considered that perhaps she could have found someone else, of which she left me for? I really haven't seen any evidence for that, and I don't like speculation. Regardless, I came crashing down from cloud 9.

&amp;#x200B;

My 18th birthday had arrived and with it came some special opportunities to make some money through my grandfather's trade. It required me to get a special license, and to get that license I had to go to the same area as 'Ella'. I decided I would shoot my shot and try to talk to her. While there, I texted her. To my dismay, she didn't respond as I was hoping for. She told me to ""Forget about her"" because she and I were just a ""summer fling"". Well, that's that I suppose, right? 'Ella' was the one who got away.

&amp;#x200B;

I can be a little obsessive, and this has helped me greatly with my ambitions to become a pilot. The drawbacks are being obsessive aren't good for personal matters such as mine with 'Ella'. Most others would have moved on, but I never did (and still haven't). I continued to keep tabs on her as the job with my grandfather gave me the resources to. I never tried to reach out to her, pester, or make amends. Once every month or so I would see what she was up to and then continued with my life. I admit, it was stalkerish of me, but I never tried to bother her. I watched as she got married and then had children. She eventually got the Jeep she told me she wanted so badly. Of course, she never did become a traveling photographer, but such is life. I kept away because I knew there was no chance: Ever. But still, I didn't have it in me to stop keeping tabs. It's how I am with everything. Without a constant flow of current information, I grow anxious. Simply knowing just puts me at ease.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried my best to be happy for her, but to me she would always be the one that got away. When I was that young 17 year old when she left me, I had hoped that I might have another chance when I was older and had more prospects. Perhaps if I had lived closer. Regardless, she became a small blip on my radar as I embarked on my quest to become an Air Force pilot. Sometimes months went by without my desire to peak at her Facebook page.

&amp;#x200B;

During a summer two years later, in the early part of June, 2016 and  I had gone to the same convention (which was at the exact same place as it was in 2014. I had attended 2015's convention too, but that story has not relevance to this one). At the preregistration of the first day, I ran into 'Ella' and her husband. They were pushing a stroller, and in an instant I recognized her. I was with my best friend. I was awestruck, but my instincts quickly kicked in. I immediately turned around and walked the other way. Luckily for me, I was in full cosplay and it seemed like she didn't notice me. I was dressed as Captain America from the First Avenger before he got his dedicated uniform. I had an authentic M1 helmet of which I painted blue. I painted a white 'A' on the forehead of the helmet and placed aviation goggles upon the helmet. I wore an intentionally weathered leather jacket with green fatigue pants, black paratrooper jump boots, and I had the stars and striped theme undershirt. Hopefully my description helps. The piece of resistance was my shield. I made it myself from some sturdy steel. It was three pointed shield like Cap's first shield in the comic and movies. The last two years had been kind to me, at least in regards to my physique. I had gained a considerable amount of muscle, specifically for the cosplay. At the time, I assumed that my cosplay and change in physique had kept her from noticing me.

&amp;#x200B;

I went on through the con with my best friend like all was normal. I did not go out of my way to look for her, but I kept an eye out. I never did see her again. It was a big con after all and many people were in attendance.

&amp;#x200B;

Another year and a half pass (November 2017), and to my surprise she messages me on Facebook. I had not kept tabs on her for several months as I had become very busy with my goals. Her message was an apology. She said she had done some introspection and thought of me. She said she felt like ""a royal ass"" for the way she treated me. I humbly accepted the apology and told her I was glad to hear from her. We caught up with one another and shared the progress we had made in our lives with one another. She told me that she did recognize me that day in June 2016. She had two children now from her husband. We agreed we would be friends for real this time.

&amp;#x200B;

However like before, some considerable time passed before we talked. I looked at her Facebook page as was my sparse habit. I discovered that she had once again removed me from Facebook as a friend and this struck me as odd. I had my speculation as to why, but never could quite put my finger on it. I continued focusing on my ambitions and decided not to reach out about it.

&amp;#x200B;

This brings my story to the present. A few days ago I decided to look at her Facebook page for the first time in 6 months. I noticed that she posted a TikTok video of herself in cosplay. I couldn't resist and I downloaded TikTok to check it out. I found her account and was once again awestruck. It was the first time I had heard her voice since we had dated. I planned on keeping under the radar like I always had been. I never wanted to make myself known or to disturb her daily life. I made an account under the name of my WoW character's last name (because I'm a roleplayer) and used artwork of him as a profile picture. I didn't expect her to recognize the name, and the picture had been commissioned long after she and I had dated. I followed her TikTok and liked several of her videos there. She was kind of popular on TikTok with over 10,000 followers. She was getting tens of followers a day, so I figured I would blend in easily with the traffic.

&amp;#x200B;

Sure enough, several hours later I get a private message from her on TikTok asking if it was me. I was absolutely appalled. How did she know it was me? I never wanted to approach her, yet here she was approaching me. I did lie, I replied honestly and said that it was me. I asked how she knew to which she responded with that she recognized the character in the profile picture as something I tried to have her draw when we were dating. Even then, that surprised me as my character had no special feature to him. In fact, my WoW character's appearance is heavily influenced by Big Boss from Metal Gear Soilid 3, and he often gets mistaken as Snake from MGS. The sheer odds that from the multitudes of people who follow her on the daily, that she picked me out from the character concept I used as a profile picture are just astronomical.

&amp;#x200B;

I swiftly apologized. I did not forget the fact that she removed me as a friend on Facebook, and I figured my following her was not to her liking with that in mind. I told her that I didn't want to cause any trouble. She dismissed my apology and told me not to worry about it. We proceeded to catch up like we had a year and a half before. Later that evening she messaged me to chat, she said she wasn't feeling quite right and wanted someone to talk with. I was oblivious and missed her message. Once I saw it (at 2 AM because I'm an idiot) I replied asking what was wrong. I saw that she posted a video and I'm not sure if it has any relevance to me or not. The video was brief and it was her drawing. Before it showed her drawing it showed a written message saying that her state of mind wasn't the greatest, so she drew that to cope with it. The drawing featured a girl falling headfirst. Simple enough, right? The thing that caught my eye were the hashtags on the video's description. ""&lt;3 #falling #art #artist #sketch #sad #cope #coping #waterfountain #love #falling #cute #4u"". Did this have any reference to me? Am I just being obnoxiously conceited to consider that? I'm torn 50/50 on that part. I have no clue what's going on in her life. Maybe she's talking about some variable entirely unknown to me. Perhaps she's talking about the artwork. The thing is about the artwork, the drawing is given a whole new meaning with the context of the aforementioned hashtags. I've decided that I'll never know really what it was about.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where fate decided to play with me. The very next day, I embarked on a short roadtrip to her area again. I had a friend who is studying abroad who needed to be dropped off at the airport. So, a day after she and I talk again, necessity brings me to her area. I try to keep that fact subtle when talking to 'Ella' as I figured it might come off the wrong way if I openly advertised it. I gently let the information out that I was in the area. I asked for advice on where to eat and good anime shops to visit. I took her advice, and promptly left. I made not attempt to physically see her, and I think that was a wise decision on my part. I continue to chat with her sparsely on average throughout my day. And that brings me to now.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this story was all over the place, but that's that. I really just needed to type it all out to organize my thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

The song, ""I Just Died in Your Arms Tonight"" by Cutting Crew comes to mind when I think of this whole mess.

&amp;#x200B;

So what are your thoughts?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preface: I am here to share with everyone a peculiar experience that I&amp;#39;ve had. It&amp;#39;s partly to get it all out on the table and in another part to see what others might have to say. I&amp;#39;m not used to Reddit and have usually just looked at the posts of others, so this is my first real post. I&amp;#39;ll start this story chronologically as I feel it is easiest for readers to understand that way. I guess it is relevant to share that at the time of writing this, I am a 22 year old male.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the first week of June, 2014. I was 17 years old and only a few months away from being 18. All of my friends were a few years older than me, so they had graduated high school a few years ahead of me and went on to go to college together. Luckily for me, I kept up with them in the summer time: This summer had something special in store, and right at the start. We had planned for months to go to an anime convention and according to my research it was quite a popular annual affair for the anime nerdy types like myself. For my friends, it was their third or second time, but it was my first to this convention (or any convention for that matter). We drove 6 hours to get to the city where the convention was hosted and all crammed into a shitty little Red Roof Inn that was 10 mins from the convention site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day before the convention, I discovered that it was customary to get your badge so when the convention started you wouldn&amp;#39;t have to wait through the first panels. At the eve of the convention opening there was a masquerade ball and I decided I would like to go, but my friends lacked my interest. Feeling that I was an independent and mature 17 year old (what 17 year old doesn&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re mature?), I went on my own. I had never been to any sort of formal dance, so it sounded interesting to say the least, but that sort of thing had always caught my eye. I bought a mask in advance to coming to the convention and made sure to bring my only suit. I had the guys drop me off at the convention venue (a really ritzy and large hotel) and inside I went. A lot of the patrons were in cosplay or anime themed gowns, which was really fun to see.It was something new and I loved it, though it didn&amp;#39;t play as much ballroom/waltz music as I expected or would have liked. I was lucky that they played a few 40s styled swing dance songs (I am a history major and I love the music from the 20s, 30s, and 40s in the U.S.).  I am a strange person in  that I am not initially outgoing when introduced to new people, but once the ball is rolling I am very outgoing, so I had a rough time finding a partner to dance. I&amp;#39;m only 5 Ft. 9 In. and very agile and thin. I&amp;#39;ve since put on some muscle, but back at the time I looked something close to Steve Rogers before Dr. Erskine&amp;#39;s super soldier serum. Luckily I wasn&amp;#39;t quite as bad as Steve Rogers, but you get my point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had made friends with a group of strangers, most of which did not know eachother prior to the masquerade ball. We danced to the modern pop music together and broke the ice.  Briefly the group split up to get drinks and due to my social success I was feeling a little more confident. A song I know very well came on, and in fact I had placed it upon the request list. The song was &amp;quot;In the Mood&amp;quot; by Glenn Miller, so I searched for a partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was when I saw her. She had beautiful long auburn hair with blue eyes that seemed to peer into my soul. Her slender curves were complimented by a quaint emerald gown. From behind her gown I could see she was wearing the tale of a fox as a sort of cosplay item. She smirked at me with a confident gaze and my heart melted away nearly instantly. I was never used to that type of attention for a woman, so I glanced over my should to see if was looking at someone more sightly behind me. To my surprise, she was looking and smiling at me and by the time I turned back to face her she was approaching. As she stood before me, I was relieved to see that I had half an inch on her. She asked me if I would like to dance with her, and nervously I said yes. She asked if I liked to swing dance, and I gave her an answer in the affirmative. She and I began to swing dance at a comfortable pace; looking back, I can tell she was trying to gauge how comfortable I was. Once she saw that I knew how to swing dance, she picked up the pace and it was honestly impressive. I had taught myself how to swing dance, so I wasn&amp;#39;t used to having such a skilled partner. She was still better than me, but I held my own. We worked so well together, that a crowd had formed around us to watch as we tore up the floor with our mad skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song had ended and quickly the crowd dissipated because the DJ put on a slow dance song. She and I were out of breath and looked at eachother. She didn&amp;#39;t even ask at this point, she grabbed my hands and places them upon her waist as she stepped closer to me. We shared that dance as we caught our breath, and I was uncertain how to proceed. Luckily for me, she took charge. She asked for my name, and I gave it to her. I asked for hers, and she told me it was &amp;quot;Foxy&amp;quot;. I chuckled at the pseudonym, not because it was funny, but at the irony. Foxes were my favorite animal. Once I explained the coincidence, she chuckled too. I asked her this time, &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s your real name?&amp;quot; She told me that I would have to wait until midnight to find out when everyone took their masks off.  If she was trying to pique my interest, she had hit her mark. From this point onward, she and I spent the rest of the masquerade together. I introduced her to the other group of friends I had made that night. The masquerade ball proceeded with lots of dancing and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After several hours of new friends and dancing, the ball drew to a close and our group of 5 people decided we weren&amp;#39;t quite ready to call it quits. So we decided to go to IHOP and have some late night breakfast. I sat across from Foxy, who was just as stunning without her mask on. Throughout the meal and conversations, I caught her eyeing me and at other times she would catch me eyeing her. As we talked as a group, Foxy and I discovered that we had a lot of anime, music, and gaming interests in common. As we finished our meals, we exchanged numbers and decided to get some sleep before the start of the con the next day. I had arranged for my friends to pick me up at the IHOP and to the shitty Red Roof Inn I returned. Throughout the night Foxy and I texted eachother where she shared her real name. I&amp;#39;ll call her Ella for the sake of anonymity. She and I had spent the rest of the night texting one another about what panels we wanted to go to together. I learned that &amp;#39;Ella&amp;#39; was 21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dawn of a New Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day of the con. I put on my first cosplay, and boy was I excited. I cosplayed a military alchemist from Fullmetal Alchemist. I don&amp;#39;t have the natural haircolor to call myself Roy Mustang. I met up with &amp;#39;Ella&amp;#39; at the con and we started out by going to a dancing instructional panel. We quickly found out we already knew what they had to offer and moved on. We looked at all the neat cosplays as we wondered to the dealers hall and artist&amp;#39;s alley. We explored both to both the wares of all the artists and vendors and this lasted several hours. We then decided to find some food, and the hotel which hosted the con was very overpriced. We went across the street to a Denny&amp;#39;s due to it&amp;#39;s proximity, and it seemed many con-goers were onto the same idea as it was packed. I wish I had more noteworthy details to share about this day, but honestly it went by so quickly and with all the new sights it is hard explain everything. At the very least I can say I had a fantastic time. That evening there was a rave at which it seemed most of the con-goers were anticipated to attend. Of course, &amp;#39;Ella&amp;#39; and met up and danced away until 4 in the morning. The tightly packed room proved instrumental for shoving us into one another in the chaos of the rave. It made for some good sexual tension, that&amp;#39;s for sure. The tension built, but as 4 AM arrived, we retreated back to our respective hotels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another day and with it I brought another cosplay. It was a friend&amp;#39;s costume that didn&amp;#39;t fit him anymore, but it fit me perfectly. It was Altaïr Ibn-La&amp;#39;Ahad from the first Assassin&amp;#39;s Creed game. I wasn&amp;#39;t a die hard fan, but I did very much like the first few installments of the series. I rocked that costume and &amp;#39;Ella&amp;#39; seemed to thoroughly enjoy it as well. She was an aspiring photographer and artist and she was determined to catch some good photos of my cosplay. We spent the day together again and that night was yet another rave. Just as the previous night, we had one helluva time and the sexual tension peaked. We left the rave early and met up at a park. She picked the location as she was from the area and I was not (in hindsight, perhaps it wasn&amp;#39;t a good idea to meet someone I just met at a discreet location at night, but hey. She wasn&amp;#39;t an axe murderer so who cares, right?). At the park we talked for several hours about our lives, hopes, dreams, hobbies, and interests. The night ended with a passionate make out session between the two of us and it felt genuine. I had borrowed a friends car to see her, so once we decided it was time we drove back to our respective places (for me, the shitty Red Roof Inn).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dawn of the Final Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the last day of the con, and it was a half day. We spent as much time together as possible as we recognized that our time to part was fast approaching. I wanted to see the artists&amp;#39; alley and vendors&amp;#39; hall one last time as I heard there would be sales as it was the last day. The day seemed to have gone by very quickly and before we knew it the con was over. My friends and I decided we would leave the following morning, some of my friends had even left that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Ella&amp;#39; and I continued to text eachother from our difficult parting at the con earlier that day, and decided we couldn&amp;#39;t part like that. She came to meet me at my hotel and I saw her outside. You might think it&amp;#39;s cheesy, but we made out on the hood of her car on the outskirts of the parking lot. We didn&amp;#39;t have a whole lot of options, as for reasons I don&amp;#39;t entirely recall, we couldn&amp;#39;t go to her place. Well the make out became quite heated and a certain point arrived that we decided we wanted to go somewhere more private. My friend very kindly let his car, so &amp;#39;Ella&amp;#39; and I found somewhere discreet to park. We made out again, but this time it continued into something further. We had passionate sex in the back of my friends car, and then cuddled for awhile. It was 4 AM when we decided we needed to part again. Before we parted, we made it official that we would try to make long distance work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came back to the shitty Red Roof Inn and slept for a few hours before the long drive home. Luckily I didn&amp;#39;t have to drive for most of it. Were I not excited to text &amp;#39;Ella&amp;quot;, I would have slept the whole trip home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A month passes by and &amp;#39;Ella&amp;#39; and I Skype&amp;#39;d (because it was 2014) every day. I had fallen hard for this woman, she was beautiful, kind, funny, nerdy (like me), and always optimistic. She was a free spirit who had simple dreams to be a photographer who traveled in a Jeep across the country. My own dreams were to be someone of importance: To be someone worth remembering. My aspirations were to become an officer in the United States Air Force and hopefully fly (I am still in fierce pursuit of this dream today, and it&amp;#39;s going well despite the inevitable roadblocks). Our dreams didn&amp;#39;t quite coincide together, but we lived over 200 miles apart as it was and neither of were ever close to reaching our dream yet. My hope was that if we lasted that long, we would cross that bridge when we go to it. We were both very supportive of eachother and it was a genuinely happy time for me. My only longing was to see her in person again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A month into our relationship and such an opportunity arises. My grandfather (I was raised by my grandparents) had a business trip in the area which &amp;#39;Ella&amp;#39; lived, and he needed me to help him. He was picking up a vehicle from a dealership and he needed someone (myself) to help him drive the second vehicle. Well, while in the area I &amp;#39;got lost&amp;#39; and met up with &amp;#39;Ella&amp;#39;. Our visit lasted 45 minutes, and they went by so soon. We passionately made out at our reunion, all in the back of a new vehicle. My grandfather was calling to &amp;#39;help&amp;#39; me navigate to his location for lunch and we knew our reunion was short lived. I wore a button-up red, green, and brown plaid shirt over a t-shirt with the buttons unbuttoned. She asked to keep my overshirt because it smelled like me and I obliged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our visit was short and that was bitter for &amp;#39;Ella&amp;#39; and I. Two weeks passed without event or change in behavior. I was almost 18, but as much as I wouldn&amp;#39;t like to admit it at the time, I was a kid. As such, I was a faithful Boy Scout (Eagle Scout in fact) and I was in attendance to a high adventure camp in the Colorado area. The trip featured white water rafting and an over night backpacking trip. The location of the camp had shit service and I religiously searched for all the spots I could have reception to reach &amp;#39;Ella&amp;#39;. I messaged her as frequently as I could and into the late hours of the night, standing in the most awkward places as it was the only place I had reception. I shared with her the highlights of my trip and she would share with me the highlights of her day. Well the week had passed and it was time to go home and by the time I finally had a steady reception things took a nose dive for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Ella&amp;#39; messaged me on Skype where she said she wanted to talk about something, and I knew something was amiss. Who doesn&amp;#39;t get nervous at those words? She said that she wanted to break up with me because she felt that I deserved something better. I told her that I wanted to be with her, but she insisted. Dejectedly, I conceded after my brief resistance to the notion of breaking up. The time we shared together was precious to me, and I didn&amp;#39;t want to lose her entirely. My only request was that we still be friends at which she obliged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time had passed without talking, at least a month. I figured she needed distance, and I wasn&amp;#39;t sure I couldn&amp;#39;t make things weird so I stayed way. I figured she would talk to me when she was ready, but I was mistaken. Figuring that a month was an appropriate time already, I tried to reach out to her and found that she had removed me from social media and Skype. I was obviously sad, but what could I do? I sat and watched from a distance at her Facebook. It took about two months or so for her to find someone else, and I found that to be normal. I considered that perhaps she could have found someone else, of which she left me for? I really haven&amp;#39;t seen any evidence for that, and I don&amp;#39;t like speculation. Regardless, I came crashing down from cloud 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 18th birthday had arrived and with it came some special opportunities to make some money through my grandfather&amp;#39;s trade. It required me to get a special license, and to get that license I had to go to the same area as &amp;#39;Ella&amp;#39;. I decided I would shoot my shot and try to talk to her. While there, I texted her. To my dismay, she didn&amp;#39;t respond as I was hoping for. She told me to &amp;quot;Forget about her&amp;quot; because she and I were just a &amp;quot;summer fling&amp;quot;. Well, that&amp;#39;s that I suppose, right? &amp;#39;Ella&amp;#39; was the one who got away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can be a little obsessive, and this has helped me greatly with my ambitions to become a pilot. The drawbacks are being obsessive aren&amp;#39;t good for personal matters such as mine with &amp;#39;Ella&amp;#39;. Most others would have moved on, but I never did (and still haven&amp;#39;t). I continued to keep tabs on her as the job with my grandfather gave me the resources to. I never tried to reach out to her, pester, or make amends. Once every month or so I would see what she was up to and then continued with my life. I admit, it was stalkerish of me, but I never tried to bother her. I watched as she got married and then had children. She eventually got the Jeep she told me she wanted so badly. Of course, she never did become a traveling photographer, but such is life. I kept away because I knew there was no chance: Ever. But still, I didn&amp;#39;t have it in me to stop keeping tabs. It&amp;#39;s how I am with everything. Without a constant flow of current information, I grow anxious. Simply knowing just puts me at ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried my best to be happy for her, but to me she would always be the one that got away. When I was that young 17 year old when she left me, I had hoped that I might have another chance when I was older and had more prospects. Perhaps if I had lived closer. Regardless, she became a small blip on my radar as I embarked on my quest to become an Air Force pilot. Sometimes months went by without my desire to peak at her Facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a summer two years later, in the early part of June, 2016 and  I had gone to the same convention (which was at the exact same place as it was in 2014. I had attended 2015&amp;#39;s convention too, but that story has not relevance to this one). At the preregistration of the first day, I ran into &amp;#39;Ella&amp;#39; and her husband. They were pushing a stroller, and in an instant I recognized her. I was with my best friend. I was awestruck, but my instincts quickly kicked in. I immediately turned around and walked the other way. Luckily for me, I was in full cosplay and it seemed like she didn&amp;#39;t notice me. I was dressed as Captain America from the First Avenger before he got his dedicated uniform. I had an authentic M1 helmet of which I painted blue. I painted a white &amp;#39;A&amp;#39; on the forehead of the helmet and placed aviation goggles upon the helmet. I wore an intentionally weathered leather jacket with green fatigue pants, black paratrooper jump boots, and I had the stars and striped theme undershirt. Hopefully my description helps. The piece of resistance was my shield. I made it myself from some sturdy steel. It was three pointed shield like Cap&amp;#39;s first shield in the comic and movies. The last two years had been kind to me, at least in regards to my physique. I had gained a considerable amount of muscle, specifically for the cosplay. At the time, I assumed that my cosplay and change in physique had kept her from noticing me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went on through the con with my best friend like all was normal. I did not go out of my way to look for her, but I kept an eye out. I never did see her again. It was a big con after all and many people were in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another year and a half pass (November 2017), and to my surprise she messages me on Facebook. I had not kept tabs on her for several months as I had become very busy with my goals. Her message was an apology. She said she had done some introspection and thought of me. She said she felt like &amp;quot;a royal ass&amp;quot; for the way she treated me. I humbly accepted the apology and told her I was glad to hear from her. We caught up with one another and shared the progress we had made in our lives with one another. She told me that she did recognize me that day in June 2016. She had two children now from her husband. We agreed we would be friends for real this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However like before, some considerable time passed before we talked. I looked at her Facebook page as was my sparse habit. I discovered that she had once again removed me from Facebook as a friend and this struck me as odd. I had my speculation as to why, but never could quite put my finger on it. I continued focusing on my ambitions and decided not to reach out about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings my story to the present. A few days ago I decided to look at her Facebook page for the first time in 6 months. I noticed that she posted a TikTok video of herself in cosplay. I couldn&amp;#39;t resist and I downloaded TikTok to check it out. I found her account and was once again awestruck. It was the first time I had heard her voice since we had dated. I planned on keeping under the radar like I always had been. I never wanted to make myself known or to disturb her daily life. I made an account under the name of my WoW character&amp;#39;s last name (because I&amp;#39;m a roleplayer) and used artwork of him as a profile picture. I didn&amp;#39;t expect her to recognize the name, and the picture had been commissioned long after she and I had dated. I followed her TikTok and liked several of her videos there. She was kind of popular on TikTok with over 10,000 followers. She was getting tens of followers a day, so I figured I would blend in easily with the traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, several hours later I get a private message from her on TikTok asking if it was me. I was absolutely appalled. How did she know it was me? I never wanted to approach her, yet here she was approaching me. I did lie, I replied honestly and said that it was me. I asked how she knew to which she responded with that she recognized the character in the profile picture as something I tried to have her draw when we were dating. Even then, that surprised me as my character had no special feature to him. In fact, my WoW character&amp;#39;s appearance is heavily influenced by Big Boss from Metal Gear Soilid 3, and he often gets mistaken as Snake from MGS. The sheer odds that from the multitudes of people who follow her on the daily, that she picked me out from the character concept I used as a profile picture are just astronomical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I swiftly apologized. I did not forget the fact that she removed me as a friend on Facebook, and I figured my following her was not to her liking with that in mind. I told her that I didn&amp;#39;t want to cause any trouble. She dismissed my apology and told me not to worry about it. We proceeded to catch up like we had a year and a half before. Later that evening she messaged me to chat, she said she wasn&amp;#39;t feeling quite right and wanted someone to talk with. I was oblivious and missed her message. Once I saw it (at 2 AM because I&amp;#39;m an idiot) I replied asking what was wrong. I saw that she posted a video and I&amp;#39;m not sure if it has any relevance to me or not. The video was brief and it was her drawing. Before it showed her drawing it showed a written message saying that her state of mind wasn&amp;#39;t the greatest, so she drew that to cope with it. The drawing featured a girl falling headfirst. Simple enough, right? The thing that caught my eye were the hashtags on the video&amp;#39;s description. &amp;quot;&amp;lt;3 #falling #art #artist #sketch #sad #cope #coping #waterfountain #love #falling #cute #4u&amp;quot;. Did this have any reference to me? Am I just being obnoxiously conceited to consider that? I&amp;#39;m torn 50/50 on that part. I have no clue what&amp;#39;s going on in her life. Maybe she&amp;#39;s talking about some variable entirely unknown to me. Perhaps she&amp;#39;s talking about the artwork. The thing is about the artwork, the drawing is given a whole new meaning with the context of the aforementioned hashtags. I&amp;#39;ve decided that I&amp;#39;ll never know really what it was about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where fate decided to play with me. The very next day, I embarked on a short roadtrip to her area again. I had a friend who is studying abroad who needed to be dropped off at the airport. So, a day after she and I talk again, necessity brings me to her area. I try to keep that fact subtle when talking to &amp;#39;Ella&amp;#39; as I figured it might come off the wrong way if I openly advertised it. I gently let the information out that I was in the area. I asked for advice on where to eat and good anime shops to visit. I took her advice, and promptly left. I made not attempt to physically see her, and I think that was a wise decision on my part. I continue to chat with her sparsely on average throughout my day. And that brings me to now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this story was all over the place, but that&amp;#39;s that. I really just needed to type it all out to organize my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song, &amp;quot;I Just Died in Your Arms Tonight&amp;quot; by Cutting Crew comes to mind when I think of this whole mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

Every morning we wake up to a kiss and a cuddle

and maybe even some passionate morning sex

We start the day off by being so close in each others arms

Even if its quick because we woke up a little late.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyday we begin the day with such love.

Everyday we begin the day feeling special

We start off the day knowing we are truly loved,

With a smile and a big spring in our step.

&amp;#x200B;

We grab our coffee and go about our day,

working, events, childcare, etc…....

We go about the day always thinking of each other

sending the odd “I love you” “I miss you” texts throughout the day.

&amp;#x200B;

We are hopeless, We are in love

And nothing can get in the way

Nothing could distract us

Or turn our heads away.

&amp;#x200B;

We both feel so safe and secure,

We both are sure that we are truly loved

We have each other back

Through the good days and bad.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of a hard day at work

We come home to a love like no other

There to offer a warm hug and great encouragement

As we put our day aside to enjoy our evenings together.

&amp;#x200B;

We enjoy our evenings together as we are on this crazy adventure

We make each day count as we are never promised another

We walk on the beach and dance under the stars

We make beautiful love through everything we do.

&amp;#x200B;

We lay on the sofa to watch a good movie

As we unwind from a hectic day

We take in a deep breath as a sigh of relief

That we are home with our true love feeling so safe.

&amp;#x200B;

Our life is a wonderful adventure

More love than we have ever known

We feel like we can do anything

As we make each other our king and queen.

&amp;#x200B;

We just love being together

And being each other very best friend

We love traveling, going to concerts, doing life together

And living a life true adventure.

&amp;#x200B;

Our love is very special and can never be questioned

The love that we have can never be tainted

It wouldn't matter if a true beauty queen or a hunk came along

We'd no that's just surface and not worth a second look.

&amp;#x200B;

We are so perfect for each other

That we cherish our love

We treat each other amazingly

We've been dating about 2 years now, and when we started, I was a depressed mess on the tail end of a decade-long struggle with self hatred. I gave up on all my life's dreams because I did poorly in school, dropped out of university, and didn't like my appearance in general.  I'd mostly bottled up my feelings but one day, when I was having a particularly rough few days, he saw the writing on the wall and talked me down from it. I was immediately blown away by how caring and sweet he was, his mannerisms were so genuine and I desperately wanted to hug him within only an hour of chatting.

After about 2 months, we started flirting and it sort of all just developed from there. He slowly gave me my confidence back, I started working again and within a year considered going back to uni and giving it a serious try this time. He told me that no matter what happens, he'll always stay by my side, even in times of insecurity. I usually go into relationships believing that both parties should work hard to ensure that they're life long, and I'm so happy that I finally met someone who believes that too! For the first time in my adult life, I'm happy, and it's all thanks to him. To say I love him is an understatement, I think he's my soulmate. After years of shitty bfs I think he's finally the one!!! I love everything about him, he's smart (denies it), handsome (denies it), strong willed, empathetic, and most of all committed.

I love when it rains at night, it makes it easier to sleep and stuff, but it can't even compare to his voice! Over the years I've drifted off to the sound of his voice many times, and had the best nights of my life as a result.

I love him unconditionally and unwaveringly. We've argued a few times, but always been able to bounce back, and even if I get frustrated with him, I never want to leave. Not now, not ever. I want to be the last thing on his mind before he goes to sleep, like he is for me. For the rest of our lives.

So how do I(20 female) know if i'm in love or just want to be closer friends to someone?

He's a istp (19 male) that we are close friends even though we don't talk much.I think its due to working together in school projects most of the time and i did ask him face on if we are close friends. I've known him for 3 years but deep inside,i know i'm not really that close to him since i don't know anything about him outside from the time i meet him in school.Usually this doesn't bother me with friends since i'm not sure if i want to keep this bond between him alive after graduation(I've only have 2 friends which was kept with low effort since they live far from me and they are usually busy so we don't do meetups like at all but we do keep in contact a few times per few months and it doesn't feel like we have grown apart so far)

But...

Nowadays,i had this want to keep this strong friendship even after graduation and it doesn't help that i have 3 separate dreams where i was chatting real excited like an extrovert to him alone and the feeling was always warm and fluffy like although i don't feel lust towards him.I frequently check my ig story and see if he did saw my story and each time he saw my story or liked my post,i would feel slightly happier than my other friends since its like he noticed me in a way.(I dont usually feel this way when my other friends liked or saw my post) I've also felt embarrassed when talking about romance with him alone vs me being confused by people's dumb action when 'in love' with other friends in a group.I also just had this want to know more about him in terms of how he thinks,how he see the world etc just recently and am giving some of my time within reasons to hang out with him and if possible alone so that i can ask more personal questions and know him more face to face.I find it hard to hang out or talk to people without a purpose so this is a first for me to ask personal questions and trying to find reasons to see him face to face and talk to him more.I find myself jealous or sad when he talks and have more physical contact to his other male friends more compared when he talks to me sometimes because i want to be that guy when he talk cause he feel more in his comfort zone than when talking to me.I also like the sound of his voice,i do think he's cute although i don't strongly feel those warm fluffy feeling that i have when i'm in love with a franchise or book.But sometimes i had this feeling of just holding his hand,hugging,being in close contact with him and even kissing him like what couples do although there's no lust feeling whatsoever since i'm bored of porn(its like watching animal zoo tbh)

What i want from him is not a couple status although i do think its nice but i want him to feel that i am trust-able to the point where he's isn't afraid to talk to me because of his own fear,society or self expectation etc and i'll like to do the same for him. I've also come to my own conclusion and is sure that he's an istp(even though i didn't ask him to do the mbti quiz since i want to know more about him first hand) and done some reading on how to catch his interest,talk longer,predicting what he like and putting it into action.

I'm so confused even though i do read what being in love is like but it just doesn't feel right.Mainly because i don't feel lust towards him but i want him to accept who i really am when i do expose my inner self and i want to do the same for him.

So what do you think?Am i in love or just want to really be friends to him in the long run?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how do I(20 female) know if i&amp;#39;m in love or just want to be closer friends to someone?&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;ve known him for 3 years but deep inside,i know i&amp;#39;m not really that close to him since i don&amp;#39;t know anything about him outside from the time i meet him in school.Usually this doesn&amp;#39;t bother me with friends since i&amp;#39;m not sure if i want to keep this bond between him alive after graduation(I&amp;#39;ve only have 2 friends which was kept with low effort since they live far from me and they are usually busy so we don&amp;#39;t do meetups like at all but we do keep in contact a few times per few months and it doesn&amp;#39;t feel like we have grown apart so far)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays,i had this want to keep this strong friendship even after graduation and it doesn&amp;#39;t help that i have 3 separate dreams where i was chatting real excited like an extrovert to him alone and the feeling was always warm and fluffy like although i don&amp;#39;t feel lust towards him.I frequently check my ig story and see if he did saw my story and each time he saw my story or liked my post,i would feel slightly happier than my other friends since its like he noticed me in a way.(I dont usually feel this way when my other friends liked or saw my post) I&amp;#39;ve also felt embarrassed when talking about romance with him alone vs me being confused by people&amp;#39;s dumb action when &amp;#39;in love&amp;#39; with other friends in a group.I also just had this want to know more about him in terms of how he thinks,how he see the world etc just recently and am giving some of my time within reasons to hang out with him and if possible alone so that i can ask more personal questions and know him more face to face.I find it hard to hang out or talk to people without a purpose so this is a first for me to ask personal questions and trying to find reasons to see him face to face and talk to him more.I find myself jealous or sad when he talks and have more physical contact to his other male friends more compared when he talks to me sometimes because i want to be that guy when he talk cause he feel more in his comfort zone than when talking to me.I also like the sound of his voice,i do think he&amp;#39;s cute although i don&amp;#39;t strongly feel those warm fluffy feeling that i have when i&amp;#39;m in love with a franchise or book.But sometimes i had this feeling of just holding his hand,hugging,being in close contact with him and even kissing him like what couples do although there&amp;#39;s no lust feeling whatsoever since i&amp;#39;m bored of porn(its like watching animal zoo tbh)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What i want from him is not a couple status although i do think its nice but i want him to feel that i am trust-able to the point where he&amp;#39;s isn&amp;#39;t afraid to talk to me because of his own fear,society or self expectation etc and i&amp;#39;ll like to do the same for him. I&amp;#39;ve also come to my own conclusion and is sure that he&amp;#39;s an istp(even though i didn&amp;#39;t ask him to do the mbti quiz since i want to know more about him first hand) and done some reading on how to catch his interest,talk longer,predicting what he like and putting it into action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so confused even though i do read what being in love is like but it just doesn&amp;#39;t feel right.Mainly because i don&amp;#39;t feel lust towards him but i want him to accept who i really am when i do expose my inner self and i want to do the same for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you think?Am i in love or just want to really be friends to him in the long run?&lt;/p&gt;

This is my first entry here and, I decided to make an account in this place because I would feel very embarrassed to say this in front of another person. I 'm a 25 years old girl. I always focused on my hobbies and being a successful woman. Don't consider myself unattractive but not so beautiful. 0 experience in love. 

 Had cancer two years ago. My family left me alone. I was unemployed, my best friend died at that moment, it was a disaster. I didn't want to disturb anyone, so i decided to face it alone.

One day i discovered a facebook page referring to my favorite video game. Everything normal at the beginning, jokes and memes. It sounds absurd, but it's funny how something so small keeps you alive in the most difficult times. Time passed. I overcame cancer. Everything was better. When I saw that one of the administrators of the page was upset about something, i encouraged myself and drew a picture for him. So far, i think he is an important part of my life. So i wanted to make him happy, even if it was something momentary that he could forget later. 

One day I decided to talk to him privately and become his friend. He's kind and funny, more than  expected. We have some things in common. i continued writing to him from time to time.  he sent me a song. When i heard it, i found myself identified and .. FEELS! i told him how much he means to me. Since then, i think, i began to have feelings for him. He strives daily and wants to improve himself. That, definitely made me love him more. 

I think he's not interested in me. So i leave all of that aside and continue without bothering him. 

When I decided to post a picture of myself, he became interested a bit. Then I showed him a nicer picture, and suddenly I found him very interested. Actually that made me happy but  it seems that is the only thing he likes about me. I decided to confess and apparently it is reciprocal. I cannot believe it. So we decided not to advance until i see him in person to confess properly. 

Although, sometimes he shows disinterested. I'm not really the kind of girl he likes. I like him a lot, so i don't want to seem creepy by harassing him with unnecessary questions. He is a busy person and i´m too, but i can't get him out of my head! I want to go through the stupid forest to go see him and hug him!

I even see him interested in other girls, but really, I dont want to give up.

Hello!

I have a bit of a first world boy-related issue which I just need advice and speculation on from people I don't know, so I'd be really really grateful if anyone has anything to say about this!

I have no experience in love or dating, so I don't really know what's going on to be honest.

So, it's a long story...

I'm at the end of Year Eleven now; my exams start on Monday. At the beginning of Year 10, I was put in a new History class with my favourite teacher, and a lot of people from the other side of the school who I didn't know as well at the time.

I was really quiet and shy, and therefore not one of the 'cool people'. I was sat in the middle of a row at the back of the classroom, in the middle of two boys I didn't know. One of them was more popular and we got on really well and had a laugh.

I didn't really talk to the other one. I had a but less tolerance at the time and the sounds he was always making with his retainer and knuckles really irritated me.

We didn't really get on.

However, as time went on, we started to talk a bit more and really get on. We were both really good at History and worked very well together, so in all of the seating plans since (they're not changed often in that class) we've been sat next to each other, which we've both been happy about.

And by the beginning of this academic year we were really good friends, following each other on social media and had a laugh in class together. But then I started getting signals.

I wasn't sure, but something seemed to tell me that he liked me, and for several months I went over it in my mind, dismissed it, in a never-ending cycle which I thought had really ended every time I dismissed it again.

The signs only got stronger.

And then I had a dream. I dreamt that I went out with him and I got excited about it with my now ex-best friend. This massively confused me because I didn't fancy him, and I stayed in the same cycle - did he like me? Did I like him? Dismissed... and then again because I did not know the answer to any of those questions.

We started to message a lot more (admittedly I initiated it a lot, but only because I wanted to strengthen our friendship, and in fairness I got a lot back) and there was some awkwardness because we were breaking into it. We mainly talked about school stuff, and he was always very supportive of my ambitions, and we started to have some private jokes.

By this point it definitely seemed like he liked me. So I thought about it, and it didn't take long for me to finally admit that I liked him (although I was in denial for about a week so my friends forced my confession out of me). 

He did not get on at all with my best friend - who shared a class with him - and they ended up constantly (and still now) throwing insults at each other, but the stories were always quite amusing. 

We messaged and messaged, and we started to flirt. And then it escalated quite a lot and got quite consistent, and he basically said that he liked someone and that he sat next to them in our class last year and this year and now, and their name begins with E. So he told me it was me and that he would ask me out, but we talked about this all under the impression of 'him telling me who it is'. So he said that he would 'tell me who it is' tomorrow. But then he procrastinated and the moment sort of went so he didn't. He said that he didn't like anyone, and I asked him why he told me that he did in that case. He said that it was 'April Fool's I guess' and that he was just going with whatever was going on. I told him that I wasn't quite sure what he thought he was going with because nothing was going on and he said 'neither am I'.

So that was not fun.

But that's only the middle of this story!

We only have that one lesson together, so we only had one lesson left until the upcoming two-week holiday. I was absolutely dreading it and there was so much build up to it, but he didn't turn up, which was a relief.

This meant that we had a two week break as a buffer between that point and the next lesson so that we could pretend it hadn't happened. I was actually quite grateful for that. He shouldn't have been able to show his face (although at a later point he told me it was because of the orthodontist, but it wasn't on the register so I'm just convinced he was avoiding it - or at least delaying if he actually was at the orthodontist).

So the first lesson we had after the holidays was less of a thing because it was all over and done with, it 'hadn't happened' and was 'forgotten about'. We spent the first twenty minutes in the most awkward and excruciating silence I have EVER experienced, and I have experienced A LOT of awkward silences!! The teacher talked for about ten minutes, and then we got started on a sheet. We spent all of this time looking absolutely everywhere else but at each other and I was basically pretending that he didn't exist. I was trying to act normal, and for the entire time I was debating in my head whether to ask him how his holidays were because that is what I would have done ordinarily, and therefore not asking him that would establish that it was awkward and therefore that something had actually happened which I remembered. But I didn't build up the courage to, and after the first twenty minutes he finally said something random about the sheet.

I didn't even hear what he said. I was shocked that he'd spoken, and so relieved that he was the first one to speak; to establish that we were acting normal and it had never happened. 

""Hmm, sorry what?"" I stuttered.

He repeated it and I still hadn't heard but I just smiled slightly and said ""Yeah, that's true.""

And in that moment some sort of sad understanding seemed to pass between us.

And so conversation started, and didn't really flow at first; it was really awkward but a relief just because it was some conversation and a pretention that everything was normal and nothing had happened. And then he just wouldn't stop talking! It was awkward smalltalk conversation, but there was definitely a lot to say - we both rambled a lot. 

At some point before the next lesson, I 'accidentally' sent him a post on Instagram (it was just a nice library picture) just to diffuse the tension. I quickly said 'shit sorry I meant to send that to Anna' (my friend) but he laughed and said that it's fine. We used to text every single day so that stopped the awkwardness in the fact that we hadn't messaged since and that what had happened was the last thing on our conversation screen. 

We didn’t talk beyond that, and when we got to our next lesson I was exhausted (I suffer from insomnia, so this is normal for me), and he appeared to get quite bored by me, which irritated me because I’m not here to please anyone! The next lesson I basically put no effort in at all, but it turned out that that made him try even harder! It actually ended up as quite a fun experiment. The less I talked, the more he talked. And I mean seriously, he rambled on and on and on, and ended up talking about his metabolism, which was random! It was amusing after what he’d done, to see him grasping at straws to stay afloat, and putting in all the effort. Although of course I am exaggerating; I didn’t completely leave him to it, but my point is that he felt the need to fill in absolutely every gap and I wouldn’t have even needed to contribute anything to the conversation for a lot of the lesson because he would just say anything. It was a good sign that he was trying; he was fighting to keep our friendship afloat.

The next time we texted was when I asked him what we would be doing next lesson (in the class we shared together) so that I could bring in the right book. He wasn’t sure either and he could have then ended the conversation, but he did seem to be making an effort to keep it open. He didn’t really ask me questions but he kept saying stuff and kept it very open when he just didn’t need to.

So we got back to talking and our friendship strengthened. We both made an effort in class and there was no awkwardness; we had a really good laugh. 

Then he admitted that he likes this other girl at school, and they’re also really good friends and talk and call really often. Like, they’re **really** close friends. Me and him always tend to message every day now because we’re really good friends, so we talk about this a lot now. When he said that he liked her, I agreed that I’d help find out if she liked him. We argued earlier about the fact that he was procrastinating just asking her out and getting it over with. And then later on today I messaged her and found out that she definitely doesn’t like him because she likes someone else. He asked me what she said and I told him the general gist, but he basically said that he has a chance with everyone so he’ll just ‘work his magic’ (which is laughable). But then he said that it seems dodgy, and I agreed, but he hadn’t finished. He said that it seems dodgy; pretending to like someone in order to procrastinate. 

And to me, that seemed dodgy.

He kept making excuses not to ask her out/tell her how he feels and tried to get into normal conversation about these random things, apart from one part of the conversation. He asked me if I would ask someone if I was in his situation, and I said no because I’d want them to work for me so that I have value, social etiquette etc. etc.. He said, “So”, “if you liked someone” “And they liked you back and you thought it was obvious” “You’d do something?” And I said no because they need to be prepared to work for me because otherwise I wouldn’t have value and it sets out the whole dynamic of the relationship, etc., etc. And he just said that he supposes so. And then he started to talk about one of his excuses not to ask her out again.

It just seems odd. 

Because I don’t know if he does actually like me, or if he did actually like me or if this is still part of one big joke from before, or if did like me and he still does and he’s trying to make me jealous, or if he did like me, he actually does like her now, or if he liked me before, he likes me now and they’re both in this to try and get me and him together in some mad way?

I have no idea what is going on and I just really really need some advice, opinions and ideas. ANY will do, please! 

Oh, he also said earlier on that they were maybe meeting up over the weekend, and she told me that he asked and he said no. So the other option is that before, everything was a joke, he legit does like her now but she’s hiding what’s going on completely from me, even though me and her are really good friends and we always tell each other about this?!

Please help me!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t sure, but something seemed to tell me that he liked me, and for several months I went over it in my mind, dismissed it, in a never-ending cycle which I thought had really ended every time I dismissed it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signs only got stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I had a dream. I dreamt that I went out with him and I got excited about it with my now ex-best friend. This massively confused me because I didn&amp;#39;t fancy him, and I stayed in the same cycle - did he like me? Did I like him? Dismissed... and then again because I did not know the answer to any of those questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started to message a lot more (admittedly I initiated it a lot, but only because I wanted to strengthen our friendship, and in fairness I got a lot back) and there was some awkwardness because we were breaking into it. We mainly talked about school stuff, and he was always very supportive of my ambitions, and we started to have some private jokes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this point it definitely seemed like he liked me. So I thought about it, and it didn&amp;#39;t take long for me to finally admit that I liked him (although I was in denial for about a week so my friends forced my confession out of me). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did not get on at all with my best friend - who shared a class with him - and they ended up constantly (and still now) throwing insults at each other, but the stories were always quite amusing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We messaged and messaged, and we started to flirt. And then it escalated quite a lot and got quite consistent, and he basically said that he liked someone and that he sat next to them in our class last year and this year and now, and their name begins with E. So he told me it was me and that he would ask me out, but we talked about this all under the impression of &amp;#39;him telling me who it is&amp;#39;. So he said that he would &amp;#39;tell me who it is&amp;#39; tomorrow. But then he procrastinated and the moment sort of went so he didn&amp;#39;t. He said that he didn&amp;#39;t like anyone, and I asked him why he told me that he did in that case. He said that it was &amp;#39;April Fool&amp;#39;s I guess&amp;#39; and that he was just going with whatever was going on. I told him that I wasn&amp;#39;t quite sure what he thought he was going with because nothing was going on and he said &amp;#39;neither am I&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that was not fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s only the middle of this story!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only have that one lesson together, so we only had one lesson left until the upcoming two-week holiday. I was absolutely dreading it and there was so much build up to it, but he didn&amp;#39;t turn up, which was a relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This meant that we had a two week break as a buffer between that point and the next lesson so that we could pretend it hadn&amp;#39;t happened. I was actually quite grateful for that. He shouldn&amp;#39;t have been able to show his face (although at a later point he told me it was because of the orthodontist, but it wasn&amp;#39;t on the register so I&amp;#39;m just convinced he was avoiding it - or at least delaying if he actually was at the orthodontist).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first lesson we had after the holidays was less of a thing because it was all over and done with, it &amp;#39;hadn&amp;#39;t happened&amp;#39; and was &amp;#39;forgotten about&amp;#39;. We spent the first twenty minutes in the most awkward and excruciating silence I have EVER experienced, and I have experienced A LOT of awkward silences!! The teacher talked for about ten minutes, and then we got started on a sheet. We spent all of this time looking absolutely everywhere else but at each other and I was basically pretending that he didn&amp;#39;t exist. I was trying to act normal, and for the entire time I was debating in my head whether to ask him how his holidays were because that is what I would have done ordinarily, and therefore not asking him that would establish that it was awkward and therefore that something had actually happened which I remembered. But I didn&amp;#39;t build up the courage to, and after the first twenty minutes he finally said something random about the sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t even hear what he said. I was shocked that he&amp;#39;d spoken, and so relieved that he was the first one to speak; to establish that we were acting normal and it had never happened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hmm, sorry what?&amp;quot; I stuttered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He repeated it and I still hadn&amp;#39;t heard but I just smiled slightly and said &amp;quot;Yeah, that&amp;#39;s true.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in that moment some sort of sad understanding seemed to pass between us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so conversation started, and didn&amp;#39;t really flow at first; it was really awkward but a relief just because it was some conversation and a pretention that everything was normal and nothing had happened. And then he just wouldn&amp;#39;t stop talking! It was awkward smalltalk conversation, but there was definitely a lot to say - we both rambled a lot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point before the next lesson, I &amp;#39;accidentally&amp;#39; sent him a post on Instagram (it was just a nice library picture) just to diffuse the tension. I quickly said &amp;#39;shit sorry I meant to send that to Anna&amp;#39; (my friend) but he laughed and said that it&amp;#39;s fine. We used to text every single day so that stopped the awkwardness in the fact that we hadn&amp;#39;t messaged since and that what had happened was the last thing on our conversation screen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t talk beyond that, and when we got to our next lesson I was exhausted (I suffer from insomnia, so this is normal for me), and he appeared to get quite bored by me, which irritated me because I’m not here to please anyone! The next lesson I basically put no effort in at all, but it turned out that that made him try even harder! It actually ended up as quite a fun experiment. The less I talked, the more he talked. And I mean seriously, he rambled on and on and on, and ended up talking about his metabolism, which was random! It was amusing after what he’d done, to see him grasping at straws to stay afloat, and putting in all the effort. Although of course I am exaggerating; I didn’t completely leave him to it, but my point is that he felt the need to fill in absolutely every gap and I wouldn’t have even needed to contribute anything to the conversation for a lot of the lesson because he would just say anything. It was a good sign that he was trying; he was fighting to keep our friendship afloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time we texted was when I asked him what we would be doing next lesson (in the class we shared together) so that I could bring in the right book. He wasn’t sure either and he could have then ended the conversation, but he did seem to be making an effort to keep it open. He didn’t really ask me questions but he kept saying stuff and kept it very open when he just didn’t need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we got back to talking and our friendship strengthened. We both made an effort in class and there was no awkwardness; we had a really good laugh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he admitted that he likes this other girl at school, and they’re also really good friends and talk and call really often. Like, they’re &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; close friends. Me and him always tend to message every day now because we’re really good friends, so we talk about this a lot now. When he said that he liked her, I agreed that I’d help find out if she liked him. We argued earlier about the fact that he was procrastinating just asking her out and getting it over with. And then later on today I messaged her and found out that she definitely doesn’t like him because she likes someone else. He asked me what she said and I told him the general gist, but he basically said that he has a chance with everyone so he’ll just ‘work his magic’ (which is laughable). But then he said that it seems dodgy, and I agreed, but he hadn’t finished. He said that it seems dodgy; pretending to like someone in order to procrastinate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to me, that seemed dodgy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He kept making excuses not to ask her out/tell her how he feels and tried to get into normal conversation about these random things, apart from one part of the conversation. He asked me if I would ask someone if I was in his situation, and I said no because I’d want them to work for me so that I have value, social etiquette etc. etc.. He said, “So”, “if you liked someone” “And they liked you back and you thought it was obvious” “You’d do something?” And I said no because they need to be prepared to work for me because otherwise I wouldn’t have value and it sets out the whole dynamic of the relationship, etc., etc. And he just said that he supposes so. And then he started to talk about one of his excuses not to ask her out again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just seems odd. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I don’t know if he does actually like me, or if he did actually like me or if this is still part of one big joke from before, or if did like me and he still does and he’s trying to make me jealous, or if he did like me, he actually does like her now, or if he liked me before, he likes me now and they’re both in this to try and get me and him together in some mad way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what is going on and I just really really need some advice, opinions and ideas. ANY will do, please! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, he also said earlier on that they were maybe meeting up over the weekend, and she told me that he asked and he said no. So the other option is that before, everything was a joke, he legit does like her now but she’s hiding what’s going on completely from me, even though me and her are really good friends and we always tell each other about this?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please help me!&lt;/p&gt;

I spent the night at his place but we didn’t have sex because we were both pretty drunk honestly ( I know real classy, but it just happened). So fast forward to now about another 2 months later he finally has some time off work and asks me if I would like to see each other again while he is off. I say of course and we agreed to meet on a Friday that week because I was going to be out there for an interview anyways. When I told him I had an interview his eyes lit up and our whole date he was saying how he really hoped I got the job so I can eventually move closer. Our date went really well again. I spent the night, magic happened and then went home after we had breakfast. He was texting me everyday up until I was supposed to get my results for the interview. I never heard from them and all he really said was “damn”. And he hasn’t texted me since. It hurts, I’m not gona lie. I feel rejected on both ends for not getting the job and him ending it because I live  too far basically. Our schedules do conflict but I feel that if we really wanted to make it work we could. And I would be willing to do this. But now I feel that this is the end of the road because I didn’t get this job.. and it just feels unfair. What do I do?

Sorry this is a bit wordy.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met this guy on a dating app he’s 31 I’m 28F. He was the first one I talked to on there and basically the last one because I’m done with online dating now. Anyways, we talked for about 2 months (periodically) before actually meeting because our work schedules were pretty conflicting and I live about an hour away. I could tell from his texts that he seemed like a pretty down to earth guy and I was excited for our date, but was trying to not to get my hopes up too much. Well turns out he’s adorable and I was instantly attracted to him and his personality. He isn’t a hunk with a 6 pack and chiseled jaw law,  he’s actually on the shorter side with an average body type, but omg he’s the sexiest man I have ever met. He has these golden brown eyes that I could gaze into forever and a cute little Chicago accent. I’m sort of a hopeless romantic if you can’t tell, but this one knocked it out of the park for me.

""Yes or no,"" he whispered softly as his hands swept across my jaw to hold my chin in place, forcing me to look at him.

Yes, yes, yes, yes!

The tension was palpable and our eye contact didn't break for what felt like hours. His fingers stroked my jaw.

He pulled me forward and kissed me. My hands immediately reached up to the back of his neck to play with his hair. I was insecure and nervous because I hadn't had much experience, which he noticed and made him chuckle. Our kiss deepened and became passionate, heated.
Our hands became nimble and started to caress each other, causing moans and pants.

I swallowed and blinked away the sudden fantasy. He was still holding my jaw, patiently looking into my eyes. I looked away from him and his hand fell. He sighed slightly.

""You know it takes forty minutes to drive you home."" He smiles slightly. ""Don't you think we should start going?""

I shrugged and fiddled with the hem of my sweatshirt. ""Probably.""

I could feel him looking at me. I smiled slyly and said ""I am seriously tempted to wait and answer after you start driving.""

He laughs and rolls his eyes ""Well then I'd have to stop the car!""

I laugh, smiling fondly as I look at him. He has the begining of a beard and extreamly curly hair, both a light shade of brown. His eyes were a calm, soft blue. Like the ocean, just after the sun rises.

""What?"" He asked softly. I shrugged, again, with a small smile.

""I like your face.""

He chuckled and looked ahead, above his steering wheel. He put one of his hands on it, turning away from me slightly.

""Can you guess?"" I asked shyly, looking at him sideways.

""Can I guess what?""

""What my answer would be.""

He looked at me, thinking.
""In the moment?"" He gave me a hungry glance before looking back to the mountains ahead. ""I think the answer was yes.""

I smiled softly and looked toward those same mountains.

I noticed movement and he put his hand in front of me.
I looked between him and his hand.
""What?""

He laughed, ""Do you want to hold hands?""

I smiled and interlaced our fingers. We sat in a comfortable silence, when he chortled.

""Its kind of difficult to drive shift holding hands like this.""

""Oh,"" I realized, letting go. He smiled softly.

""That's why you put your hand on mine."" He set his hand down and I chuckled softly. I once again interlaced my fingers with his. He turned on his car as I started up the music. We drove for a few minutes before I laughed.

""Trev?"" I asked.

He looked over at me, quizzical.

One day I was having a great time with my girlfriend and then the next day we broken up. Please do not get the wrong idea about her. She is an amazing girl but because of life it made her broken.\n\nLast year November I met my girlfriend Jenny. Let\'s call her that. I met her before but it was small talk and I was too shy to talk to her further. We were having a good time together. We talked for long hours, go hangout together and relax. We both gave each other life lessons and learned from one another. Well I actually learned more from her. She has more common sense than me. From the very beginning and I mean when we first met she was honest with me. She actually wanted me to stay away from her because she was afraid of hurting me emotionally. She had a bad past and life and people treated her unfairly and made her toxic. She was a nice girl at first but as time went on she was dealt one bad hand after another. At the time I met her she made the big decision to change herself and make her life positive. Even though she was and still is trying to make herself better she still was afraid of being in a serious relationship. That didn\'t stop me. I was determined to win her over and in the process help her with her goals.\n\nA week later I asked her out. She was still hesitant about it but a friend convinced her to give me a try. The week after, we went to a bar, played pool, drank and got to know each other better. There she told me practically everything that has happened to her. Till now she hasn\'t told me everything. After her long story telling she asked if I still wanted to be with her. I said yes. No matter what her past was it doesn\'t define who she is now. She wants to get better and is doing so. She actually makes an effort. I can see the good in her even if she doesn\'t see it. Call me naive and stupid but I don\'t regret anything. After she told her story I was both mad and sad. I hugged her and told her how I felt. She was taken aback by my kindness. Not to boast but I am the nicest guy she has ever met and that is also a reason why she tried avoiding me. She didn\'t want to corrupt me (She didn\'t by the way). At the end of the night we hugged goodbye and I was thinking on kissing her. She pushed me away and said ""sorry but I have to go"". Again, still was hesitant about me.\n\nThe next couple of days we talked even more. We went out three more times and had fun together. She was warming up to me and to the idea of having a relationship. On the fourth night after we hung out at her job I kissed her. We both were about to leave and we gave each other a goodbye hug in the parking lot. I looked her in the eyes and went for it. From there everything began. I met her best friend and close friends. They are awesome and saw me as the right guy for Jenny. I gave her my Nintendo 3DS XL and she was smiling ear to ear when she had the chance again to play Pokemon again. I had the latest Pokemon games so that made her more excited.. We went out to restaurants, bars, going to rock concerts at bars. We talked to each other about our problems and helped each other out. Whenever one of us had a bad day we would go out of our way to comfort each other. I brought her wine as she loved drinking it. She would make me sushi. She works at a sushi place and knew I love fish. We were a happy couple. We had no arguments, no dislikes for one another. Even though there are certain things about us that kinda conflicted we would work it out and make the best of it.\n\nNow come March. We went to a bar and a male friend of hers was there with us. We were having a good time. A bartender from another bar came in and was drinking with her husband. She greeted us and paid for drinks for all of us. She called me over to a corner and asked me if there was anything going on with Jenny. I didn\'t know what she was talking about. She asked if she and the guy were just friends. I assured her they are friends. They are still friends right now. I guess. Then she called Jenny over and talked with her. They were talking for a pretty long time. We all got to together and had one last drink. We all said our goodbyes and headed home. From there I thought another good night had past but I was wrong. \n\nThe next day Jenny needed to talk with me after work. The last time she said ""we needed to talk"" it was for an incident that wasn\'t really that bad. She was scared she messed up the relationship. I wish it was like that incident. We sat in my car in the parking lot of her job. My stomach filled butterflies. I had every scenario in my head and the break up was one of them. She looked into my eyes and sorrowfully said we should break up. I felt like puking. Everything shattered around me. She told me that she had been flirting with guys a month before. Not on purpose but being too friendly, to the point where something might happen. She would compose herself and remind herself that she is with a me and that she was having old feelings. She tried brushing it off. But that night the bartender made her realized that she was slipping up. Her friends noticed her behavior as well and she claimed that everything was fine. She was lying to herself about the situation. From there she knew that if this goes on any further she might cheat on me and hurt me. Her best friend told her this and so did the bartender. They said that if she can\'t stop it then the best option was to break up with me so she wouldn\'t make a terrible decision during the relationship. Just letting you know I had no hard feelings towards the best friend and bartender for what they said. They were voicing their opinion and made the good decision to say it for me and Jenny\'s sake. Jenny\'s morale compose is shattered. She can tell right from wrong but wouldn\'t care. She would go with the flow and let things happen. If she has an urge she would go on it. Yes you can say it. Even she said it. She\'s a whore. That didn\'t stop me. I pleaded with her, told her that I forgive her and we can get through all of her problems together. She wanted me to abandon her but I couldn\'t. I didn\'t realize it at that moment but I was in love with her. I wanted to make her happy. To give her the life she deserves. She made me happy. Made me like myself for who I am and be open to it. She stood her ground and explained to me how things can go wrong. How she would make me toxic and we would hate each other in the end. I didn\'t want to believe it or think it. But she was making sense. I\'m sorry if I can\'t explain this so we\'ll right now. I held back my tears and tried pleading with her again. It didn\'t work. She says to find someone better than her. How can I after finding such a person who knows what she wants? Who is mature. Who is honest with everyone and herself. Who made me feel like a hero, like a somebody. She is one in a million and it took me years to find her. No matter what I said she would say the same thing. I had no choice but to give in. We talked a little and made some jokes about how the relationship went. We shared a kissed and said goodbye. \n\nI drove far away into the night. I went to a beach and cried. I begged to whatever God is out there to watch over her and give her the life she truly deserves. \n\nFast forward to almost the end of March. Jenny\'s birthday was coming up and the night before it she went to a concert at a bar. I was there as well to enjoy the concert and hangout with Jenny and her friends. We talked about things and I tried getting over the event. I thought I was over it. It was me, her, her best friend, her best friend\'s boyfriend and a guy friend. The concert went off and we were enjoying the band. Jenny and her friend were drinking a lot and were dancing and head banging to the awesome music. Something went on with Jenny\'s best friend and her boyfriend but let\'s not get into that, but it did affect Jenny\'s mood and made her drink more. At that point she was drunk. Jenny was dancing around when suddenly she fell. At first I was just to myself and just enjoying the night. That moment when she fell I went into a panic. I rushed to her aid and some friends helped out also. She kept saying she was fine till she kept falling down again and again. I told her to stop and told her I will be taking her and her friend home since I had to drive them. She said to me ""Leave me alone. I\'m not good enough for you. Go get get someone better than me."" She wasn\'t listening. I held her up and just went with the flow. I had her leaned on me just in case. I couldn\'t let her go. It was 2 in the morning. The band stopped playing and Jenny calmed down a bit. The lead singer of the band came up to us and asked if we were okay. I assured him that all was well. The same bartender from that night gives me a drink to help sober up Jenny. We left the bar and headed to my car. Jenny and her best friend started play fighting. I had to break it up just in case things get heated since they were still drunk. Needless to say I got wet from it cause Jenny\'s best friend dumped the drink on Jenny and me. I was irritated but focused on the tasked at hand. I tried escorting Jenny to my car but she insisted on walking on her own. We got into my car and drove to her best friend\'s house. I escorted them out and asked them if they will be okay. They said they are gonna have to talk about some things and let things cool down. Jenny still wanted me to leave her alone. She was home so I felt better for the time. I kissed her forehead and headed home with a bad feeling in my gut. Sleep was murder.\n\nThe next day Jenny apologized to me on Whatsapp about how she acted. I told her it was alright. She still said the same thing. I should cut my losses and not socialize with her anymore. I told her I\'m not abandoning her. She still didn\'t like the idea but accepted it. The rest of the day she enjoyed her birthday and all was well again with everyone. A couple of nights afterwards I invited Jenny out for a drink. We hung out and enjoyed ourselves. The bar closed and we headed to her car. I hugged her goodbye and she says ""This is thank you for helping me that night. I\'m sorry for being mean to you."" She held head and we kissed. Kissing her after so long was like a dream. I held nothing back and kissed her with all my passion. Alas it was a short dream come reality. She told me again that we couldn\'t be together because of how she was and I told her again that I see good in her. We smiled and tried again to justify me stop seeing her. I wasn\'t backing down and told her that I will always see her for what I see. Break up or not.\n\nNow comes the second week of April. Ever since that night before her birthday I had Jenny on my mind none stop. I couldn\'t bare to see her hurt. It made me feel guilty even though it wasn\'t my fault. From there my emotions went into overdrive. I was having mixed emotions. Mainly on how things went wrong and how I wanted to be with her. I began to be physically ill. It was war in my mind and then the dust settled. I came to a conclusion that I should have seen and known long ago. Actually I had the feeling but wasn\'t sure when to bring it out. I knew then and there that I\'m in love with Jenny. Everything we had was good. We were good together. I helped her out. I made her happy. I want to be there for her and the thoughts of something bad happening to her still kills me to this day. I made a final attempt to get her back. It might work and it might not work. I planned out an entire monologue and trip down memory lane. I was gonna do whatever I can to get her back. \n\nI met her after she finished work. I did as I planned and told her I love her. She knew from the beginning. She always knew even if I didn\'t know. She says I\'m an amazing guy and the nicest person ever but we still couldn\'t be together. She\'s broken and has problems she needs to fix on her own. I assured her that I would do anything to help but she refused. She says that it was better for me not to be involved. She told me things I didn\'t know. I wish I could have done more but there wasn\'t anymore I could have done. She thanked me for being with her and apologized for hurting me. \n\nLater that night we talked on the phone via WhatsApp. She had something important to tell me. I was scared. I refused to hear it and told her that no matter what bad thing she has to say about herself I will still see her as I always seen her. I still do now even when she told me she cheated on me. She lied to me to not hurt me but had to say it since I derserved to know. She actually cheated on me. I don\'t know with who but I think I have a feeling who. She told me this and I thought I was gonna be wrecked. I was calm. I still felt the same way. I told her I forgived her. She did it yes, she knew what she did. She still did it and she lied to me about it. Am I mad? Yes. But not at her. Not her for one bit. Again I know what I\'m saying might be stupid to most of you but I\'m fucking sticking with what I have to say. It\'s because of how life and people and her damn parents treated her. She didn\'t deserve all of these problems. She was a nice girl and yet everyone just pushed her away and twisted her. I know what she did was wrong but I don\'t blame her. I still love her and would do anything to make her happy. She\'s an amazing girl and she deserves happiness. \n\nNow as for me right now I,ve accepted the fact that we won\'t be getting back together. We still talk and are still good friends. I make sure to talk to her and give her the positivity she needs and she appreciates it. Of course she still has her problems but one step at a time they will fade to black. I am trying to work on myself and keep myself active and learn more about myself. One thing is for sure and that\'s that I\'m in love with Jenny and wished everyday that we can be together again. A guy like me has no charm. But after being with Jenny I began to love myself for how I look and acted. I used to try and be someone else. But I should have learned from Spider-Man. I might be a big nerd but I\'m an amazing guy who everyone loves and respects. Thinking about I just realized how Jenny feels about herself comparing to how I did to myself. I\'m a cool dude and at the end of the day people like and respect me. I hope Jenny sees the good in her someday. Jenny was and still is an amazing girl. I get depressed still about the fact that I\'m alone again. I don\'t know when I will get fully better. I don\'t know if I will meet another great girl soon. With my luck it will take years. Who knows?\n\nSo if you have read this can you tell me what you think?

One day I was having a great time with my girlfriend and then the next day we broken up. Please do not get the wrong idea about her. She is an amazing girl but because of life it made her broken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last year November I met my girlfriend Jenny. Let&amp;#39;s call her that. I met her before but it was small talk and I was too shy to talk to her further. We were having a good time together. We talked for long hours, go hangout together and relax. We both gave each other life lessons and learned from one another. Well I actually learned more from her. She has more common sense than me. From the very beginning and I mean when we first met she was honest with me. She actually wanted me to stay away from her because she was afraid of hurting me emotionally. She had a bad past and life and people treated her unfairly and made her toxic. She was a nice girl at first but as time went on she was dealt one bad hand after another. At the time I met her she made the big decision to change herself and make her life positive. Even though she was and still is trying to make herself better she still was afraid of being in a serious relationship. That didn&amp;#39;t stop me. I was determined to win her over and in the process help her with her goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A week later I asked her out. She was still hesitant about it but a friend convinced her to give me a try. The week after, we went to a bar, played pool, drank and got to know each other better. There she told me practically everything that has happened to her. Till now she hasn&amp;#39;t told me everything. After her long story telling she asked if I still wanted to be with her. I said yes. No matter what her past was it doesn&amp;#39;t define who she is now. She wants to get better and is doing so. She actually makes an effort. I can see the good in her even if she doesn&amp;#39;t see it. Call me naive and stupid but I don&amp;#39;t regret anything. After she told her story I was both mad and sad. I hugged her and told her how I felt. She was taken aback by my kindness. Not to boast but I am the nicest guy she has ever met and that is also a reason why she tried avoiding me. She didn&amp;#39;t want to corrupt me (She didn&amp;#39;t by the way). At the end of the night we hugged goodbye and I was thinking on kissing her. She pushed me away and said &amp;quot;sorry but I have to go&amp;quot;. Again, still was hesitant about me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next couple of days we talked even more. We went out three more times and had fun together. She was warming up to me and to the idea of having a relationship. On the fourth night after we hung out at her job I kissed her. We both were about to leave and we gave each other a goodbye hug in the parking lot. I looked her in the eyes and went for it. From there everything began. I met her best friend and close friends. They are awesome and saw me as the right guy for Jenny. I gave her my Nintendo 3DS XL and she was smiling ear to ear when she had the chance again to play Pokemon again. I had the latest Pokemon games so that made her more excited.. We went out to restaurants, bars, going to rock concerts at bars. We talked to each other about our problems and helped each other out. Whenever one of us had a bad day we would go out of our way to comfort each other. I brought her wine as she loved drinking it. She would make me sushi. She works at a sushi place and knew I love fish. We were a happy couple. We had no arguments, no dislikes for one another. Even though there are certain things about us that kinda conflicted we would work it out and make the best of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now come March. We went to a bar and a male friend of hers was there with us. We were having a good time. A bartender from another bar came in and was drinking with her husband. She greeted us and paid for drinks for all of us. She called me over to a corner and asked me if there was anything going on with Jenny. I didn&amp;#39;t know what she was talking about. She asked if she and the guy were just friends. I assured her they are friends. They are still friends right now. I guess. Then she called Jenny over and talked with her. They were talking for a pretty long time. We all got to together and had one last drink. We all said our goodbyes and headed home. From there I thought another good night had past but I was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day Jenny needed to talk with me after work. The last time she said &amp;quot;we needed to talk&amp;quot; it was for an incident that wasn&amp;#39;t really that bad. She was scared she messed up the relationship. I wish it was like that incident. We sat in my car in the parking lot of her job. My stomach filled butterflies. I had every scenario in my head and the break up was one of them. She looked into my eyes and sorrowfully said we should break up. I felt like puking. Everything shattered around me. She told me that she had been flirting with guys a month before. Not on purpose but being too friendly, to the point where something might happen. She would compose herself and remind herself that she is with a me and that she was having old feelings. She tried brushing it off. But that night the bartender made her realized that she was slipping up. Her friends noticed her behavior as well and she claimed that everything was fine. She was lying to herself about the situation. From there she knew that if this goes on any further she might cheat on me and hurt me. Her best friend told her this and so did the bartender. They said that if she can&amp;#39;t stop it then the best option was to break up with me so she wouldn&amp;#39;t make a terrible decision during the relationship. Just letting you know I had no hard feelings towards the best friend and bartender for what they said. They were voicing their opinion and made the good decision to say it for me and Jenny&amp;#39;s sake. Jenny&amp;#39;s morale compose is shattered. She can tell right from wrong but wouldn&amp;#39;t care. She would go with the flow and let things happen. If she has an urge she would go on it. Yes you can say it. Even she said it. She&amp;#39;s a whore. That didn&amp;#39;t stop me. I pleaded with her, told her that I forgive her and we can get through all of her problems together. She wanted me to abandon her but I couldn&amp;#39;t. I didn&amp;#39;t realize it at that moment but I was in love with her. I wanted to make her happy. To give her the life she deserves. She made me happy. Made me like myself for who I am and be open to it. She stood her ground and explained to me how things can go wrong. How she would make me toxic and we would hate each other in the end. I didn&amp;#39;t want to believe it or think it. But she was making sense. I&amp;#39;m sorry if I can&amp;#39;t explain this so we&amp;#39;ll right now. I held back my tears and tried pleading with her again. It didn&amp;#39;t work. She says to find someone better than her. How can I after finding such a person who knows what she wants? Who is mature. Who is honest with everyone and herself. Who made me feel like a hero, like a somebody. She is one in a million and it took me years to find her. No matter what I said she would say the same thing. I had no choice but to give in. We talked a little and made some jokes about how the relationship went. We shared a kissed and said goodbye. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I drove far away into the night. I went to a beach and cried. I begged to whatever God is out there to watch over her and give her the life she truly deserves. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to almost the end of March. Jenny&amp;#39;s birthday was coming up and the night before it she went to a concert at a bar. I was there as well to enjoy the concert and hangout with Jenny and her friends. We talked about things and I tried getting over the event. I thought I was over it. It was me, her, her best friend, her best friend&amp;#39;s boyfriend and a guy friend. The concert went off and we were enjoying the band. Jenny and her friend were drinking a lot and were dancing and head banging to the awesome music. Something went on with Jenny&amp;#39;s best friend and her boyfriend but let&amp;#39;s not get into that, but it did affect Jenny&amp;#39;s mood and made her drink more. At that point she was drunk. Jenny was dancing around when suddenly she fell. At first I was just to myself and just enjoying the night. That moment when she fell I went into a panic. I rushed to her aid and some friends helped out also. She kept saying she was fine till she kept falling down again and again. I told her to stop and told her I will be taking her and her friend home since I had to drive them. She said to me &amp;quot;Leave me alone. I&amp;#39;m not good enough for you. Go get get someone better than me.&amp;quot; She wasn&amp;#39;t listening. I held her up and just went with the flow. I had her leaned on me just in case. I couldn&amp;#39;t let her go. It was 2 in the morning. The band stopped playing and Jenny calmed down a bit. The lead singer of the band came up to us and asked if we were okay. I assured him that all was well. The same bartender from that night gives me a drink to help sober up Jenny. We left the bar and headed to my car. Jenny and her best friend started play fighting. I had to break it up just in case things get heated since they were still drunk. Needless to say I got wet from it cause Jenny&amp;#39;s best friend dumped the drink on Jenny and me. I was irritated but focused on the tasked at hand. I tried escorting Jenny to my car but she insisted on walking on her own. We got into my car and drove to her best friend&amp;#39;s house. I escorted them out and asked them if they will be okay. They said they are gonna have to talk about some things and let things cool down. Jenny still wanted me to leave her alone. She was home so I felt better for the time. I kissed her forehead and headed home with a bad feeling in my gut. Sleep was murder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day Jenny apologized to me on Whatsapp about how she acted. I told her it was alright. She still said the same thing. I should cut my losses and not socialize with her anymore. I told her I&amp;#39;m not abandoning her. She still didn&amp;#39;t like the idea but accepted it. The rest of the day she enjoyed her birthday and all was well again with everyone. A couple of nights afterwards I invited Jenny out for a drink. We hung out and enjoyed ourselves. The bar closed and we headed to her car. I hugged her goodbye and she says &amp;quot;This is thank you for helping me that night. I&amp;#39;m sorry for being mean to you.&amp;quot; She held head and we kissed. Kissing her after so long was like a dream. I held nothing back and kissed her with all my passion. Alas it was a short dream come reality. She told me again that we couldn&amp;#39;t be together because of how she was and I told her again that I see good in her. We smiled and tried again to justify me stop seeing her. I wasn&amp;#39;t backing down and told her that I will always see her for what I see. Break up or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now comes the second week of April. Ever since that night before her birthday I had Jenny on my mind none stop. I couldn&amp;#39;t bare to see her hurt.

I didn't like running to catch my train, but if I would have walked as casually as I do I would have missed it and I'd have to wait half an hour for the next to train to arrive.

I spurted, didn't take the escalator, people would be standing left and right there anyway. Heading straight towards the stairs, I took two steps at a time, overtaking casual other commuters.

Finally, trying to catch my breathe, I reached the train station upstairs, thankfully my train didn't arrive yet, I still had like 2 minutes on the clock. As I was walking along the station, figuring out if I want to sit in the front or back side of the train I spotted a woman. She had brown long jacket and stylish handbags, I think it was one of those designer handbags, probably the expensive ones. Since as a male I don't have much experience with handbags, I could only guess. I look at her, she had long blonde-brunette-ish hair, she looked in my direction as well. I realized that I actually know her. Yes, it was her, it must be her! The girl I knew from school. It's been so long. I smiled instantly as I was looking in her direction.

I was so confused, couldn't believe that it was her, I stood awkwardly there, as I saw almost no reaction from her side, at best a surprise, I was frozen. I turned a bit so that I wasn' t facing her directly... my thoughts running, desperately trying to figure out if it is really her and how I could approach her.

As I was standing there trying to figure out a way to talk to her and elderly woman probably asked her a question, she answered her and moved towards the stairs and went down.

I was frozen, shocked, surprised.... and confused.

I decided to talk to her, I went downstairs as well but I couldn't see her anywhere.

I wanted to talk to her so much, would have liked to know what she is doing nowadays and how she is... I think it would have been nice....

I decided to run into the McDonald's nearby maybe she was buying something there while waiting for her next train... she was nowhere to be found.

I was sad, and probably looked crazy for the other people around me. I walked upstairs again, my train arrived and I went home, thinking about her and wishing to have taken initiative.

What could have happened? If she doesn't like me anymore she could have let me know and I'd let her be..... there I am left with my thoughts.... with my thoughts about her.

In a last attempt I walked through the whole train in the hope of meeting her. I didn't found her. As I came closer to my final destination I was getting mad at myself for not taking the initiative, for being a coward, for being so awkward, ughhhh!

As I turned my head one last time, I spotted someone else, my mood instantly switched. Although we talked for like 30 seconds it was quite pleasant, I hope it was pleasant for her too, at least she said so, I wish I meet her again.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;... I didn&amp;#39;t like running to catch my train, but if I would have walked as casually as I do I would have missed it and I&amp;#39;d have to wait half an hour for the next to train to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spurted, didn&amp;#39;t take the escalator, people would be standing left and right there anyway. Heading straight towards the stairs, I took two steps at a time, overtaking casual other commuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, trying to catch my breathe, I reached the train station upstairs, thankfully my train didn&amp;#39;t arrive yet, I still had like 2 minutes on the clock. As I was walking along the station, figuring out if I want to sit in the front or back side of the train I spotted a woman. She had brown long jacket and stylish handbags, I think it was one of those designer handbags, probably the expensive ones. Since as a male I don&amp;#39;t have much experience with handbags, I could only guess. I look at her, she had long blonde-brunette-ish hair, she looked in my direction as well. I realized that I actually know her. Yes, it was her, it must be her! The girl I knew from school. It&amp;#39;s been so long. I smiled instantly as I was looking in her direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so confused, couldn&amp;#39;t believe that it was her, I stood awkwardly there, as I saw almost no reaction from her side, at best a surprise, I was frozen. I turned a bit so that I wasn&amp;#39; t facing her directly... my thoughts running, desperately trying to figure out if it is really her and how I could approach her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was standing there trying to figure out a way to talk to her and elderly woman probably asked her a question, she answered her and moved towards the stairs and went down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was frozen, shocked, surprised.... and confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to talk to her, I went downstairs as well but I couldn&amp;#39;t see her anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to talk to her so much, would have liked to know what she is doing nowadays and how she is... I think it would have been nice....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to run into the McDonald&amp;#39;s nearby maybe she was buying something there while waiting for her next train... she was nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sad, and probably looked crazy for the other people around me. I walked upstairs again, my train arrived and I went home, thinking about her and wishing to have taken initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What could have happened? If she doesn&amp;#39;t like me anymore she could have let me know and I&amp;#39;d let her be..... there I am left with my thoughts.... with my thoughts about her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a last attempt I walked through the whole train in the hope of meeting her. I didn&amp;#39;t found her. As I came closer to my final destination I was getting mad at myself for not taking the initiative, for being a coward, for being so awkward, ughhhh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I turned my head one last time, I spotted someone else, my mood instantly switched. Although we talked for like 30 seconds it was quite pleasant, I hope it was pleasant for her too, at least she said so, I wish I meet her again.&lt;/p&gt;

However if you’re a romantic like me, it’s worth the read ☺️

About a month ago, I met a guy while in Florida for a conference. I traveled with a big group if people from my school. We were out at a club on a Thursday night, and he just caught my eye. We will call him Michael. I thought he was very good looking, y’all, and he smelled amazing. So I purposely bumped into him, flirted a little and told him my name. I’m not a shy girl, but I never make the first move. Something told me I would regret not shooting my shot. 

So I did! And he was into me too! We danced all night, and he got my number. I left with my friends before he did, but we texted all the next day. He drove from his nearby campus by himself to meet me the next night at another club. Again, we danced all night and closed down the club. He had parked by my hotel, so we walked back together. I stalled until all the people from my conference had trickled back to the hotel, and then we decided to go to McDonalds. We got some food, and then parked so we could talk and listen to music. He played his music, and was dancing and singing to me in his extremely off key voice! I loved it, he was so adorable. We were looking into each others eyes, kissing... we could not keep our hands off each other. It was intense. He just made my heart melt and my knees weak.. I couldn’t resist him. So at around 3:30 AM, I went with him to his dorm. 

So, I am an adult, and I attended the conference with my peers. There is no rule against staying the night someplace else, but it’s also kinda frowned upon. So my hope was to get back before anybody in my room woke up. At around 6 AM, I got back and unfortunately there were people I knew in the lobby already up for the day. I had to duck into the little elevator area so hopefully nobody would witness my walk of shame. Despite the potential embarrassment, I was so happy. Michael made me feel giddy, and he was so fun to be with. 

So it’s Saturday now. And I had to spend the day with the group I came with. We had our last big dinner event that night, and after that I was free to do what I pleased. After the dinner, the 300 some people at the conference were all going to be going out. The biggest night for it. Yet, all I wanted to do was spend time with Michael. I decided instead to go to his dorm, and we cuddled and watched Netflix that night. 

Never in my life have I had such an instant Chemistry and connection with anybody before Michael. I dated somebody for 2.5 years who never made me feel that way. That night, we didn’t just sleep together. We made love. It was so pure and good. I will always remember it. 

My flight left Sunday evening, so all we had left was the day together before my flight back to Michigan. He drove me back to my hotel, and came inside with me to get my luggage. I saw many people from the conference, but I didn’t care this time. 

That last day we spent together was nearly perfect. We got breakfast at a diner, and then walked on the beach along the ocean for 2 hours. We held hands, collected shells, and took pictures together. Then we went to some shops, got smoothies, and headed back to his dorm. I didn’t want the day to end. He didn’t have to , but he said he would drive me to the airport. 

We cuddled together on his small dorm bed, and it was so nice. But then we looked at the time, and we realized we only had about an hour left together. As I laid my head on his chest, I couldn’t seem to fight the tears. But when I looked up at him, I realized that he was crying too. 

I watched this man cry, because he didn’t want me to leave. He said he never felt such strong feelings for a girl he’d only know for 3 days. We both agreed that we did not want it to end, and that we would keep in touch. He drove me to the airport, we said our somber goodbyes, and I got on the plane. My heart was broken. 

It’s been a month now, and we still text, Snapchat, call, or FaceTime every single day. I’ve never believed in love at first sight, but Michael was pretty damn close. I can’t say what will happen in the future, but life’s far too short to not believe in love ❤️","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story is a bit lengthy!

## 📷

Hello,  I am reaching out to this group in hopes that someone might  recall the  plot snippets I have listed below of a possible historical Romance  story I once read a long time ago. Unfortunately, I no longer know the   title or the author and what little bit I do recall is not a lot.   Romance paperback possible from the 80s, as I started reading Gothic and   then the bodice rippers at that time.

&amp;#x200B;

What I most recall of the story  ...

1. heroine  (virgin): approx. age of 18 to early 20s who liked to take walks  along  the cliffs that were behind her families estate and that of the   neighbor's house, that was adjacent to the estate. Her family was   friends of the people who lived in that house. I believe the grandfather   still lives there and his grandson comes an visits him and to see the   heroine (who the young man loves).
2. Strong  Male Hero: Probably  in his 30s who may be her guardian and he has  inherited the estate  somehow; he maybe seeking a wife and i believe he  finds our heroine  attractive but he may feel she is too young.

Situation I  
The   male Hero becomes ill (not sure why) and our Heroine is nursing him   during the evening in order for the housekeeper to get her rest and   during one of her night watches with our Hero, he was out of mind with a   fever and as she was caring for him, he grabbed her and she ends up in   his bed and being pinned under him, he has his way with her and takes   her virginity. As it started out as a rape, I believe the heroine ended   up being a participant in the act and that is what the master is   troubled by of thoughts of a passionate encounter.

* After  that  incident, the Heroine must have covered it up so that the staff  would  not be aware the next morning and she does not say anything about  the  episode when a staff member arrives that morning after;
* When  the  hero/master does recovers from his illness, he is nagged by a  sense of  something did happen and needs to find the person who was in  his room  that night;
* He does not believe it was a dream as it seemed too passionate and real to him to be anything but what really happened;

Situation 2  
Not   sure why the heroine goes to the neighboring home of the grandfather   and the young man, but she does. The young man tells her he loves her   and wants to marry her, but she does not love him. she may agree to   marry this young man just to have a home.

* Our  hero/master does go  in search of her at the neighbor’s home (don't  believe he knows it was  here in his bed that night) he may be asking  why she ran away and asking  her to return to the estate. he returns to  the estate without her.
* She   does go back to the estate and it maybe that she feels he may not  think  of her as anything other than a child but she loves him and wants  to be  near him and to run the house is better than not being near him.
* However,   sometime after she returns to the estate, the hero does learn it was   her that night in his bed when he was delirious with fever and he seeks   her out in the dining room where she is doing some work. and he   confesses his love for her and happy ending.

**Situation III**

* ·  The Heroine does return back to the estate and I feel as though the she  is pregnant. \[I do not know if she tells anyone or if the housekeeper  finds evidence that the heroine was the woman in the bed\]
* ·  I do recall a scene where the heroine is in the dining room and maybe  going through the estates china for cleaning or for getting ready for a  dinner, but the hero does seek her in this room and confronts her as I  believe at this point the hero knows that it was our heroine that was  the woman in his bed.  \[do not recall how he finds out, but he does\]
* ·  I feel as though it is during this dining room scene that the Hero  declares his feelings for the Heroine and she does the same towards him.  \[I believe he asks her to marry him and she accepts his proposal. I  believe this is how the story ends\]","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h2&gt;📷&lt;/h2&gt;

I know it’s stupid, but I can’t help but think: what if a boy did kiss me? What is it like to have someone like you? 

Then it leads me to think that maybe I’m not good enough for these boys and that I’m ugly. Thoughts saying: you’re fat. You’re not skinny enough. What’s with the acne? Maybe they’d like you if you had an ass. My self esteem is already low and with that, it’s adding more pain.

Maybe the fanfics and books have gotten to my head that I’m living in this fantasy of falling in love and being with that person forever. 

All I know is, I’m a curious child. I’m envious of friends sometimes because they have something I don’t. I’m too “innocent” to understand. I have to stay in my shell while they roam freely. 

I want to experience romance. Or maybe not that. I want to experience the things kids today do and see what’s it’s like.

I’m a curious child.

&lt;p&gt;My friends right now have already had their first kiss with boys (or girls). Some even got hickeys. And some do some dirty dirty things. And sometimes I can’t help feel kind of envious. I know it’s stupid, but I can’t help but think: what if a boy did kiss me? What is it like to have someone like you? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it leads me to think that maybe I’m not good enough for these boys and that I’m ugly. Thoughts saying: you’re fat. You’re not skinny enough. What’s with the acne? Maybe they’d like you if you had an ass. My self esteem is already low and with that, it’s adding more pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the fanfics and books have gotten to my head that I’m living in this fantasy of falling in love and being with that person forever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I know is, I’m a curious child. I’m envious of friends sometimes because they have something I don’t. I’m too “innocent” to understand. I have to stay in my shell while they roam freely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to experience romance. Or maybe not that. I want to experience the things kids today do and see what’s it’s like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a curious child. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you made it this far, congratulations 👏🏾&lt;/p&gt;

But, I fell hard for someone I was dating for 4 months. I know it isn’t much time, I’m surprised I even fell this hard for her but long story short:

These 4 months were great. We really clicked, we constantly texted throughout the day and even held multiple conversations at once on other apps (we would always share memes, posts and videos). 

We became really close, we both are busy individuals so we saw each other on the weekends. We would go out to eat and visit many places together. We had many amazing dates and everything was going perfect. We really got to know each other. Till this day, we know each other really well. 

We shared with each other our past dating life and experiences with one another. There was a special connection between us that we both identified. We would hang out, watch movies, cuddle and sleep over. In general, things were perfect and we became intimate after some time. We shared amazing moments in bed, we would always discuss how great it was

Everything went well, except for some small moments where we clashed. It was only three times. Each time was because I overreacted in a situation that didn’t make things better. I have a bit of a temper, but nothing ever got out of hand. I said some things that only made the situation worse but nothing too crazy. Each time we got over it and moved on. 

But after the third time, which happened through text, she told me to leave her alone and ignored me for 3 days. I apologized and gave her space in hopes of making things better. On the third day, I decided to send her roses with a special note attached which she received and then contacted me. 

They were really nice “luxury roses” which were expensive but the price didn’t matter to me. She told me how much she loved them and appreciate them ( to this day she sends me pictures of how the roses are blooming). But she told me afterwards that she would rather be friends instead because of my temper. It’s something she doesn’t want to deal with in the future and she believed it would continue to be a cycle that she doesn’t want to deal with. 

I understand her position, given her last history with guys who really hurt her. Learning from her last experience, I tried to be the opposite of the guys she’s told me she’s been with. My temper really messed this up. After the second time, I started taking anger management classes which was something I never told her about because I thought at the time it was embarrassing. But that’s how far I went to maintain the relationship we had. We never established a formal relationship, but we agreed to terms of only seeing each other and not talking to other parole. Which worked out well the entire time. 

It’s been a few weeks since we broke it off, and we’ve continued to talk and remain friends this entire time. We still text constantly, and the conversations are still great because we are very compatible. We’ve seen each other a few times too since then. We still go out to eat and go to the movies together since we’re both movie junkies. 

Sometimes we discuss what happened from time to time. She tells me how she doesn’t want to keep it going because she feels it’s going to happen again. And she doesn’t want to deal with it anymore even though she still has feelings about me. I revealed to her that I have been seeking help fixing my temper. I’ve made big improvements but I can’t seem to win her back.

I’ve dated many women in my life, but I never fell for anyone like this. She consumes my thoughts, there’s nothing more I want in the would then to have things back they way they were. I fell head over heals for this girl. 

What could I do to win her back? I feels like there’s something I need to do, trying to sweet talk her back isn’t going to do the trick. I know how she is. What makes the situation easier is that we are still on good terms, I’m texting her as we speak.

Dear Romance Readers: I am in need of your help in find a the below romance story ...

I was introduced to Gothic Romance genre after visiting a local book resell shop sometime around 1980. However, I did purchase Romance paperbacks such as Harlequin, Silhouette, etc. Unfortunately, I no longer recall the author or the title of this romance story that I am hoping to come across again and hoping that the below info will jog another romance readers memory of the book or provide possible suggestions. During my search for this romance book, I have come across great authors, such as Woodiwiss, Lindsay, Holm, Cookson, etc.

**\*\*\*\*\*\***

**Story Setting:**

* · Along a coast and the story references the heroine walks along her estate and neighbors cliffs\*;
* · Not sure if story takes place in England or along the eastern coastline of America

**Heroine (virgin age 18 to early 20s)**

* · The story starts shortly after the Heroine's father has passed away and she and the staff are expecting a new ""Master"" owner to her families' estate.
* · Heroine no longer has any living family members and is at the mercy of the new owner or new Master in this case.
* · Heroine does stay on living at her families former estate with the new Master and keeps her same bedroom;
* · I believe she is lonely and I believe the story references her seeking solitude in her bedroom.
* · I believe she feels useless and of no importance.
* · I also believe that the new owner is entertaining\*\* and she either is not part of the parties or she escapes to her bedroom during the parties.
* · Takes walks along the back of her families estate and that of the neighbor's home\*;
* · A male childhood friend who lives with \[I believe\] his grandfather
* · I believe she does find the new Master handsome and may have budding feelings towards him, but the new Master may see her as a child and may even treat her that way.

**Hero (maybe late 20s to mid-30s)**

* · Alpha male figure or strong character who knows what he wants;
* · I feel as though our hero is referred to as ""Master"" and runs the estate as master of his domain;
* · Do not recall how he obtained her families estate (not sure if it is a distant relative or if our hero purchased the estate);
* · I believe the hero shows indifference towards our heroine when he first meeting and does find her attractive, but he may feel she is too young for his purposes of a mate. (he may be
* · He may be searching for a wife who would fulfill his new status, but not looking for a love match
* · I feel as though he was entertaining families who have eligible daughters (or these families were pushing their daughters on him due to his title and status)
* · He may be looking for a wife that would fit his new status (good hostess and produce an heir for him)
* · I feel that with all the entertaining that he is doing that our Heroine retreats to her room for solitude or she may not be included to partake in the parties he hosts.

**Supporting characters**:

* · Grandfather: who lives in the house adjacent to the estate and is an old friend of her family. \[I believe he is survived by his late wife\]
* · Your male figure in this story is his grandson\*
* · \*Young Male Figure: who is referred to as the Heroine's childhood friend and is either living with his grandfather in this house or visits him often.
* · This young man loves our heroine and will confess his feelings to her at some point in the story; however, our heroine does not reciprocate his feelings and thinks of him only as a friend.
* · The grandfather and the young man are special to our heroine as her only source of family.
* · Estate Housekeeper: may have been with the heroine since her birth and cared for her whole life.

**Little Bits I recall of the Story:**

* · I feel as though when our Heroine \[and staff\] met the new ""master/owner"" of her families estate, she greeted him at the top of the stairs to the estate or this may have happened later on in the story when he arrived back home \[not sure\]
* · I believe that the male childhood friend of our Heroine does not like the Master and I believe it would be due to the fact that the young man has feelings for her. And the two male figures could have words said between them, as well as the Master making a reference to the heroine about the young man.

**Situation I**

* · The master has fallen sick \[not sure of the illness\], but he has a very high fever and I believe the housekeep and/or staff has been taking care of him and they are exhausted;
* · This is when our lonely heroine steps in and volunteers to sit through the night with the master (hero) and as the heroine is nursing him \[and may have reached over him\] as he laid on the bed in his fever state, he reaches up and grabs her and pins heroine on the bed underneath him and proceeds to ""make love"" to her. \[I am sure our heroine tries to free herself but to no avail\] and the master (hero) takes her virginity.
* · I believe it started out as a rape for the heroine, but I believe she savors this opportunity of discovering passion from a man \[or even this man as she has feelings for him\] as a result, this act ends up being a very heated encounter between the two.
* · The next morning, as I recall, the housekeeper is at the master's room in order to take over the vigil. I do not believe that the young woman says anything to the housekeeper or any of the staff about the sex scene that had occurred during his vigil with the master and she may have even cleared away any evidence of her losing her virginity to him.
* · However, not completely certain if she had and he may have discovered the evidence when he recovered from his illness (fever state).
* · I do recall that the master kept asking if the housekeeper/staff if there had been a woman in his room during his illness (fever state) and was told that there was not anyone other them the staff and the heroine.
* · I wish I could recall if the hero did have a woman he was dating or a potential wife, as he would have been asking if she had been in his room \[someone other than a virgin\] as I do not believe that he lets himself believe at this point in the story that it would have been our heroine in his bed that night.
* · However, when the hero does recover from his illness, he is troubled by nagging thoughts that what had happened that night with our Heroine; however, he doesn't know that it was her \[at this point in the story\] was not just a ""vivid"" dream, but it had to have really occurred.
* · As a result, he is trying to find out who had been in his room that night in order to find this woman;
* · He is told that no one other than servants and heroine had cared for him.
* · He may be seeing someone in this story; however, I do not recall
* · I feel as though he dismisses the thought that it would have been our heroine that had shared his bed that night.
* · At some point in the story, the Hero does find out that it was our Heroine who was in his bed that night during his fevered state.

**Situation II**

* · Not sure why our heroine ran away from the master (estate), but the heroine goes to the home of the young man/grandfather.
* · It may have been due to a scheming woman who has designs on the master and wants our heroine out of the way and said something to our heroine to make her run off. \[such as, that the young woman is expecting a marriage offer and will make the Heroine's live hell\]
* · While the Heroine is staying at this home, the young man declares his feelings towards her and may even ask her to marry. I believe she does tell him that she does not love him, but may agree to marry him in order to have safety and a purpose in her life – care for his grandfather. \[the grandfather suspects that she does not feel the same towards his grandson\]
* · Hero does seek her at the grandfather's home \[not sure what how he felt after she had ran off and if he just shrugged it off or if he ended up learning something from a scheming other woman vuing for his attention and marriage\] I believe our hero is developing stronger feelings for our heroine and goes to talk to her.
* · Heroine does talk to the hero but not certain if she tells him at this time that she is attending to marry the young man.
* · I believe that our hero does tell her that if she returns to the estate that she will be given importance to the estate and that could be the running of the estate. \[I do not believe that he knows that it was her in his bed – but he does want her back at the estate\]
* · I feel as though the grandfather was in a next room and heard the conversation between the hero and heroine and may have heard the tender feelings she has for this man in her voice. At any rate, I do believe that the heroine seeks the grandfather's council and I believe it is him that persuades her to return to the estate with our hero. \[she does tell the grandson/young man that she will not be marrying him and that she is returning to the estate\]

**Situation III**

* · The Heroine does return back to the estate and I feel as though the she is pregnant. \[I do not know if she tells anyone or if the housekeeper finds evidence that the heroine was the woman in the bed\]
* · I do recall a scene where the heroine is in the dining room and maybe going through the estates china for cleaning or for getting ready for a dinner, but the hero does seek her in this room and confronts her as I believe at this point the hero knows that it was our heroine that was the woman in his bed. \[do not recall how he finds out, but he does\]
* · I feel as though it is during this dining room scene that the Hero declares his feelings for the Heroine and she does the same towards him. \[I believe he asks her to marry him and she accepts his proposal. I believe this is how the story ends\]","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Romance Readers: I am in need of your help in find a the below romance story ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;· I feel as though when our Heroine [and staff] met the new &amp;quot;master/owner&amp;quot; of her families estate, she greeted him at the top of the stairs to the estate or this may have happened later on in the story when he arrived back home [not sure]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· I believe that the male childhood friend of our Heroine does not like the Master and I believe it would be due to the fact that the young man has feelings for her. And the two male figures could have words said between them, as well as the Master making a reference to the heroine about the young man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation I&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· The master has fallen sick [not sure of the illness], but he has a very high fever and I believe the housekeep and/or staff has been taking care of him and they are exhausted;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· This is when our lonely heroine steps in and volunteers to sit through the night with the master (hero) and as the heroine is nursing him [and may have reached over him] as he laid on the bed in his fever state, he reaches up and grabs her and pins heroine on the bed underneath him and proceeds to &amp;quot;make love&amp;quot; to her. [I am sure our heroine tries to free herself but to no avail] and the master (hero) takes her virginity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· I believe it started out as a rape for the heroine, but I believe she savors this opportunity of discovering passion from a man [or even this man as she has feelings for him] as a result, this act ends up being a very heated encounter between the two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· The next morning, as I recall, the housekeeper is at the master&amp;#39;s room in order to take over the vigil. I do not believe that the young woman says anything to the housekeeper or any of the staff about the sex scene that had occurred during his vigil with the master and she may have even cleared away any evidence of her losing her virginity to him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· However, not completely certain if she had and he may have discovered the evidence when he recovered from his illness (fever state).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· I do recall that the master kept asking if the housekeeper/staff if there had been a woman in his room during his illness (fever state) and was told that there was not anyone other them the staff and the heroine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· I wish I could recall if the hero did have a woman he was dating or a potential wife, as he would have been asking if she had been in his room [someone other than a virgin] as I do not believe that he lets himself believe at this point in the story that it would have been our heroine in his bed that night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· However, when the hero does recover from his illness, he is troubled by nagging thoughts that what had happened that night with our Heroine; however, he doesn&amp;#39;t know that it was her [at this point in the story] was not just a &amp;quot;vivid&amp;quot; dream, but it had to have really occurred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· As a result, he is trying to find out who had been in his room that night in order to find this woman;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· He is told that no one other than servants and heroine had cared for him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· He may be seeing someone in this story; however, I do not recall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· I feel as though he dismisses the thought that it would have been our heroine that had shared his bed that night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· At some point in the story, the Hero does find out that it was our Heroine who was in his bed that night during his fevered state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· Not sure why our heroine ran away from the master (estate), but the heroine goes to the home of the young man/grandfather.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· It may have been due to a scheming woman who has designs on the master and wants our heroine out of the way and said something to our heroine to make her run off. [such as, that the young woman is expecting a marriage offer and will make the Heroine&amp;#39;s live hell]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· While the Heroine is staying at this home, the young man declares his feelings towards her and may even ask her to marry. I believe she does tell him that she does not love him, but may agree to marry him in order to have safety and a purpose in her life – care for his grandfather. [the grandfather suspects that she does not feel the same towards his grandson]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· Hero does seek her at the grandfather&amp;#39;s home [not sure what how he felt after she had ran off and if he just shrugged it off or if he ended up learning something from a scheming other woman vuing for his attention and marriage] I believe our hero is developing stronger feelings for our heroine and goes to talk to her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· Heroine does talk to the hero but not certain if she tells him at this time that she is attending to marry the young man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· I believe that our hero does tell her that if she returns to the estate that she will be given importance to the estate and that could be the running of the estate. [I do not believe that he knows that it was her in his bed – but he does want her back at the estate]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· I feel as though the grandfather was in a next room and heard the conversation between the hero and heroine and may have heard the tender feelings she has for this man in her voice. At any rate, I do believe that the heroine seeks the grandfather&amp;#39;s council and I believe it is him that persuades her to return to the estate with our hero. [she does tell the grandson/young man that she will not be marrying him and that she is returning to the estate]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation III&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· The Heroine does return back to the estate and I feel as though the she is pregnant. [I do not know if she tells anyone or if the housekeeper finds evidence that the heroine was the woman in the bed]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· I do recall a scene where the heroine is in the dining room and maybe going through the estates china for cleaning or for getting ready for a dinner, but the hero does seek her in this room and confronts her as I believe at this point the hero knows that it was our heroine that was the woman in his bed. [do not recall how he finds out, but he does]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;· I feel as though it is during this dining room scene that the Hero declares his feelings for the Heroine and she does the same towards him. [I believe he asks her to marry him and she accepts his proposal. I believe this is how the story ends]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Alas, here I have another post, but this one is *solely* dedicated to Sarge, by wonderful boyfriend of seven years and fuel for most of my Reddit posts. Someone recently PM/DMd me and asked  what the what the most wholesome thing he's ever done was. I replied ""I can only pick one?""

I decided to pick this one, since it's the closest one to the plot of an actual fairy tale.

**Some context:** I had an abusive childhood. My parents hated me, my brother was scornful (and the golden child, of course). My birthdays were as they are meant to be- but only when I was little. It was great: friends, cake, the usual. When I got older though, my birthday became a season of screaming and tears. I'd ask for 3 things, and when they couldn't even do *that*, I got upset. Of course they became livid whenever I expressed any form of disappointment. Example:

(Me): ""For my birthday, I only want three things. First, I want to get Chinese for dinner. I don't care where, I don't care how cheap, I just would like some Chinese. Second, I want to pick a movie to watch at night. Third, I want a new jacket- mine is busted."" (Because my brother may or may not have beat it up as a confidence surge.)

(Family): ""Well *we* want sushi (I HATE seafood), you like shitty movies, and we're not buying you another fucking jacket after you ruined the last one, you spoiled, selfish brat!""

Now especially as a *kid,* when people can't even care about a ""you-day,"" especially your *family*, it feels like no one cares at all. Eventually we stopped celebrating my birthday all together. I was thankful that I got to dodge the season of hatred, but the whole thing itself was depressing. When I finally moved out (hoped on a plan to the other side of the country to get as far away as FUCKING possible) at age 17 ish (I graduated early in my Junior year: see r/self post), I made it known to everyone around me that I did *NOT celebrate my birthday*.

My long-term friend from junior high who I reference a lot to, Luna, moved with me and I made her understand this. I made sure any new friends we met at university knew this- bam. I did not celebrate my birthday. I was dead serious when I explained it too. It wasn't like a 'Oh no, I don't need anything! Don't worry about me!' type of selfless attitude, it was just too hard. I wouldn't be able to do anything without feeling self-centered. I know, it sounds so dumb.

Fast forward to when I meet Sarge in France. I am 18. We have a long-distance relationship, and by the time he comes to the US, I am 19. When he asked when my birthday was, I wouldn't even tell him. That was actually one of our first fights. He kept insisting that he wanted to do something nice for me as my boyfriend and lover, but I refused to let him even know the date. ""NO- I'm being serious, Sarge. I *do not* celebrate my birthday, I do not *want* to celebrate my birthday, *will not* do anything for the sake of that day!""

Sarge: ""Look, I know you're selfless and hate putting yourself first, but this is literally ""you-day."" How do you think I will feel when you spoil me rotten and I can't do anything for you?""

Me: ""Whopdie-fucking-do. I honestly could not give less of a shit if we don't celebrate my birthday, it's not just me being selfless, okay?""

Etc.

Since it had been a few years since I actually celebrated my birthday, I actually forgot about it when I turned 20, on January 20th (I guess apparently that's a big-deal birthday, since it's called a ""star-birthday,"" or like if you turn 12 on the 12th or something).

I woke-up like any other day and when I walked into the kitchen, Sarge was making breakfast. I was really surprised -- I still had no idea that it was my birthday -- and happy. I still remember what he made: pancakes with butterscotch chips and syrup, waffles with maple syrup and whipped cream and strawberries, crispy bacon, and deviled eggs with paprika sprinkled on top. My favorite(s).

We exchanged good-morning hugs and kisses and I sat down. From being in a great mood, I was suddenly skeptical. ""You didn't do anything... Did you?""

""Huh?""

""You didn't break or loose anything?""

He laughed. He said there was no reason for making me breakfast, he just wanted to. I pushed any suspicions aside and smiled. We ate together and Sarge mentioned that he wasn't going into work today, that he was taking the day off. Once more I was suspicious. Unfortunately, because of my upbringing, I usually have trust issues/problems understanding that people do nice things just to be nice.

His words were loosely: ""Because I remembered how much I love you last night, and I want to just be in love with you today. No responsibilities, no strings attached. I think we should take a day like that every once in a while, live life fully, yes?""

I cracked a smile and all I could do was kiss him. ""You're perfect.""

""Probably, yes.""

Laughter.

When he said ""I just want to love you today,"" I had thought he probably intended just a whole day packed with sex, good food, and cuddling. I didn't expect for him to take me into town.

We went into all the little cute local shops that get a lots of tourists during holidays, but it wasn't very busy since it wasn't a holiday. We walked all day. We went to a thrift shop to look at all the wierd and fun things and we bought a couple things, but even when the day was over, we had two bags total. Not huge bags either. We didn't go on a shopping spree, it was mostly browsing but it was *perfect*. We went to lunch at a nice place, but it wasn't formal at all. I got a bowl of pasta and Sarge got a sandwich- we split them both. I loved it!

Then, before we went home, Sarge took us to watch the sunset from the pier. When we *did* go home, I was convinced that that was the whole day and completely content with it. But that wasn't all. We pulled up to the driveway and Sarge told me to ""bundle up.""

I looked to him and said, ""What?""

He gave me a cheeky grin, ""Just trust me. I haven't screwed up today yet, have I?""

So I went inside and put on some warmer clothes and a big cozy jacket. Sarge also put on his jacket, but it wasn't very big. I mean he's from Russia, so he doesn't really get too cold. That and the man is like a giant furnace. I swear you can hug him and he's always super warm, which is great for cuddles.

Anyway, we got Comrade in the back seat again and as it was night fall, Sarge began driving again. We listened to some music from the 80's or 90's or whatever like that and just drove for like an hour. I turned the music down at some point and asked, ""Okay... I know you just want to be nice but you know I have suspicions about people who be nice for no reason. Are you *sure* there isn't some holiday I missed? Like national... Couples' day? Or our anniversary- no, see that isn't even until summer!"" I couldn't figure it out.

""No, no. You didn't miss anything. You're so sweet and wonderful on a daily basis and I just wanted to say 'I love you.'"" He took one of his hands off the steering wheel and held my hand in my lap with it.

""Well damn- you could've just bought me a chocolate bar and I'd be all over you,"" I laughed.

He drove us out to the middle of forest, away from everything and everyone. He parked in a semi-cleared area and I asked ""What now?"" I wasn't sure if this was where the sex started or maybe just some making out or something completely wholesome...?

""Now..."" He opened his door and moved to get out, ""we can see the stars.""

""Seriously?"" I couldn't believe it. ""We just get to watch the stars!?"" I beamed. All the ride over there I had been commenting on the stars which we could finally see with no light pollution. ""I *love* you!!!""

We sat on the hood of the car but left Comrade inside so he wouldn't become a pupsicle (Ha ha. I'm sooooo funny.) and just laid back for a while. It was amazing. He had gotten some blankets that he stowed away in the back and a thermos of hot cocoa, but it was white chocolate instead of milk chocolate. Interesting. Really good. I wondered how in the hell he managed to pack everything while I just changed back at the house... Either I take longer to change than I thought or Sarge is secretly the Flash.

 We saw a few shooting stars, too. When we saw the first one, Sarge turned to me and asked, ""What did you wish for?""

""To never let today end.""

""Aww, but if it never ended, we wouldn't get to do anything different. Don't you want to take another day to go skydiving?""

""... MarRY mE.""

And more laughs. We had been there for a while and then Sarge said, ""Oh wait- there's something more.""

He hopped off the hood and went to open the car again. ""More? The hell- let me guess, do you have the Queen of Sheba in there?""

He brought back a basket of muffins, my favorites! There were pumpkin and then Lemon poppyseed. ""JESUS. Did you steal Mary Poppins's bag and hide it in the car!?"" I couldn't believe I didn't smell it on the way over.

""Maybe."" He has a very handsome smile.

He settled back in next to me and for the last time I was suspicious. All the kind gestures aside, I noticed the basket the muffins were in and the smell. ""... Wait a minute... Is that, is that Luna's basket? And her recipe?"" (Luna is my long-term best friend and partner in crime) ""Okay- I'm going to ask you one last time. I love you, I love you so much, and I know you love me too, but for the love of all things holy- *what* is going on today?""

He kept saying he just ""wanted to do something nice"" but I was thinking I had cancer or something and somehow didn't know and he did, which doesn't even make sense.

This time though, he didn't give that excuse. He didn't say anything. He took a single muffin from the basket, reached behind his back and pulled out a single candle and his lighter. I was *really* confused and in shock until he stuck the candle in the muffin, started his lighter, and softly began singing ""Happy Birthday"" while lighting the candle.

I tried to keep my crying quiet, but only partially succeeded. I had forgotten my own birthday. He went around me and bribed Luna for my birth date and a basket of her famous muffins. He set up an entire day of nothing insane, but everything right, meaningful, and leisurely. I guess Luna also explained to him *why* I didn't celebrate my birthday, that I hated the feeling of being a burden and that I was asking for too much since I had it in my head that asking for anything was asking too much (thanks, shitty childhood family). But throughout the day when he kept saying, ""just because I want to,"" not only did it keep me from feeling like a burden, but it made me feel like he genuinely cared. Like he didn't just look at the calendar, groan, and try to set something up... I knew he didn't. I knew he cared.

I wouldn't have expected to be so emotional but I also didn't expect black widows to eat their mates after sex yet here we are (a random off-topic fact brought to you by an ADD mind). After the candle went out, he just put the pastry aside and gave me the biggest bear hug. I don't think I've ever felt so loved in my life.

Since then, we've begun celebrating my birthday again. It's still not a huge affair, but Luna and her boyfriend are usually involved.

Speaking of Luna- when I saw her the next day I greeted her with ""Hey, *bitch*... No I'm not mad, I love you... Nah let's get food so I can tell you all about it!""","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A/N: Jesus my posts are always f-ing long Also sorry for not posting in a minute I&amp;#39;ve been depressed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarge: &amp;quot;Look, I know you&amp;#39;re selfless and hate putting yourself first, but this is literally &amp;quot;you-day.&amp;quot; How do you think I will feel when you spoil me rotten and I can&amp;#39;t do anything for you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

We listened to some music from the 80&amp;#39;s or 90&amp;#39;s or whatever like that and just drove for like an hour. I turned the music down at some point and asked, &amp;quot;Okay... I know you just want to be nice but you know I have suspicions about people who be nice for no reason. Are you &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; there isn&amp;#39;t some holiday I missed? Like national... Couples&amp;#39; day? Or our anniversary- no, see that isn&amp;#39;t even until summer!&amp;quot; I couldn&amp;#39;t figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, no. You didn&amp;#39;t miss anything. You&amp;#39;re so sweet and wonderful on a daily basis and I just wanted to say &amp;#39;I love you.&amp;#39;&amp;quot; He took one of his hands off the steering wheel and held my hand in my lap with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well damn- you could&amp;#39;ve just bought me a chocolate bar and I&amp;#39;d be all over you,&amp;quot; I laughed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He drove us out to the middle of forest, away from everything and everyone. He parked in a semi-cleared area and I asked &amp;quot;What now?&amp;quot; I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if this was where the sex started or maybe just some making out or something completely wholesome...?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now...&amp;quot; He opened his door and moved to get out, &amp;quot;we can see the stars.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Seriously?&amp;quot; I couldn&amp;#39;t believe it. &amp;quot;We just get to watch the stars!?&amp;quot; I beamed. All the ride over there I had been commenting on the stars which we could finally see with no light pollution. &amp;quot;I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; you!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat on the hood of the car but left Comrade inside so he wouldn&amp;#39;t become a pupsicle (Ha ha. I&amp;#39;m sooooo funny.) and just laid back for a while. It was amazing. He had gotten some blankets that he stowed away in the back and a thermos of hot cocoa, but it was white chocolate instead of milk chocolate. Interesting. Really good. I wondered how in the hell he managed to pack everything while I just changed back at the house... Either I take longer to change than I thought or Sarge is secretly the Flash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw a few shooting stars, too. When we saw the first one, Sarge turned to me and asked, &amp;quot;What did you wish for?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;To never let today end.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aww, but if it never ended, we wouldn&amp;#39;t get to do anything different. Don&amp;#39;t you want to take another day to go skydiving?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;... MarRY mE.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And more laughs. We had been there for a while and then Sarge said, &amp;quot;Oh wait- there&amp;#39;s something more.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He hopped off the hood and went to open the car again. &amp;quot;More? The hell- let me guess, do you have the Queen of Sheba in there?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He brought back a basket of muffins, my favorites! There were pumpkin and then Lemon poppyseed. &amp;quot;JESUS. Did you steal Mary Poppins&amp;#39;s bag and hide it in the car!?&amp;quot; I couldn&amp;#39;t believe I didn&amp;#39;t smell it on the way over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Maybe.&amp;quot; He has a very handsome smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He settled back in next to me and for the last time I was suspicious. All the kind gestures aside, I noticed the basket the muffins were in and the smell. &amp;quot;... Wait a minute... Is that, is that Luna&amp;#39;s basket? And her recipe?&amp;quot; (Luna is my long-term best friend and partner in crime) &amp;quot;Okay- I&amp;#39;m going to ask you one last time. I love you, I love you so much, and I know you love me too, but for the love of all things holy- &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is going on today?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He kept saying he just &amp;quot;wanted to do something nice&amp;quot; but I was thinking I had cancer or something and somehow didn&amp;#39;t know and he did, which doesn&amp;#39;t even make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time though, he didn&amp;#39;t give that excuse. He didn&amp;#39;t say anything. He took a single muffin from the basket, reached behind his back and pulled out a single candle and his lighter. I was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; confused and in shock until he stuck the candle in the muffin, started his lighter, and softly began singing &amp;quot;Happy Birthday&amp;quot; while lighting the candle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to keep my crying quiet, but only partially succeeded. I had forgotten my own birthday. He went around me and bribed Luna for my birth date and a basket of her famous muffins. He set up an entire day of nothing insane, but everything right, meaningful, and leisurely. I guess Luna also explained to him &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I didn&amp;#39;t celebrate my birthday, that I hated the feeling of being a burden and that I was asking for too much since I had it in my head that asking for anything was asking too much (thanks, shitty childhood family). But throughout the day when he kept saying, &amp;quot;just because I want to,&amp;quot; not only did it keep me from feeling like a burden, but it made me feel like he genuinely cared. Like he didn&amp;#39;t just look at the calendar, groan, and try to set something up... I knew he didn&amp;#39;t. I knew he cared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t have expected to be so emotional but I also didn&amp;#39;t expect black widows to eat their mates after sex yet here we are (a random off-topic fact brought to you by an ADD mind). After the candle went out, he just put the pastry aside and gave me the biggest bear hug. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve ever felt so loved in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, we&amp;#39;ve begun celebrating my birthday again. It&amp;#39;s still not a huge affair, but Luna and her boyfriend are usually involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Luna- when I saw her the next day I greeted her with &amp;quot;Hey, &lt;em&gt;bitch&lt;/em&gt;... No I&amp;#39;m not mad, I love you... Nah let&amp;#39;s get food so I can tell you all about it!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Boys have approached me in a friendly way but not a romantic way e.g. they never ask for my number.

Unfortunately, I no longer know the title or the author.  This Gothic Romance book would be considered a bit out of date for today's society, but every once in a while I start to think about this story and I have been searching for some time in hopes of finding it to re-read it.  I stumbled upon Gothic Mystery Romance books when visiting a book resell shop towards the late 70s and I did pick up some Harlequin books, as well … not sure what this Trashy story may be classified as, but the following story snippets is what I recall.

**What I can remember of our heroine (virgin): approx. age of 18 to early 20s**

* · a young adult woman who lost her parents (mother probably at an early age), the story starts at the time of her father's death or son thereafter;
* · No male heir, the estate is either entailed to another relative or a complete stranger who has purchased the estate (wish I could remember betters):
* · Heroine is able to stay on and live in the families estate due to she is a relative or out of kindness from the new owner.
* · She is able to keep her bedroom in the estate and I feel as though she is ignored with not a lot to do.
* · I feel as though when she comes back to the estate after she ran away to the neighbors, she is given the role of running the home.
* · It may even turn out that she is pregnant.

**Male (strong) hero: Probably in his 30s (like most of these genre stories)**

* · New owner/master of the estate is an arrogant type of hero and not sure how he came to be the new master after the death of the heroine father;
* · Seems to be an angry man and may have had a bad relationship with another woman or may be forced to get married.
* · I feel as though the heroine and staff may have greeted the new master at the top of the steps, just outside the front door

**Setting:**  I am sure if it is in England or if it is along the eastern coastline in America, but I recall there was references made throughout the book that the heroine enjoyed walks along the cliffs and past the young man’s home (the neighbor to the estate)

**Supporting characters**:

* · A young man but a bit older than her lives next door with his aging father or maybe grandfather.
* · The young man loves our heroine, but she does not know until later;

**Bits I recall of the Plot:**

* · The male Hero becomes ill (not sure why) and our Heroine is nursing him during the evening in order for the housekeeper to get her rest and during one of her night watches with our Hero, he was out of mind with a fever and as she was caring for him, he grabbed her and she ends up in his bed and being pinned under him, he has his way with her and takes her virginity. As it started out as a rape, I believe the heroine ended up being a participant in the act and that is what the master is troubled by of thoughts of a passionate encounter.
* · After that incident, the Heroine must have covered it up so that the staff would not be aware the next morning and she does not say anything about the episode when a staff member arrives that morning after;
* · When the hero/master does recovers from his illness, he is nagged by a sense of something did happen and needs to find the person who was in his room that night;
* · He does not believe it was a dream as it seemed too passionate and real to him to be anything but what really happened;
* · At some point in the story, the master does find out that it was our Heroine who was in his bed that night. (not sure how he finds out and not sure if it has to do with why our heroine runs away, but she goes to the house of the young man);
* · While she is at the young man’s home, he confesses his love for her but she doesn’t feel the same towards him;
* · Our hero/master does go in search of her at the neighbor’s home and he may know that it was her or not until later in the story, but she does return to the estate;
* · I recall her being in the dining room with the housekeeper maybe getting ready for a party, but it maybe when the master confronts her about that night or maybe that she is pregnant and does the right thing by asking her to marry him.

I have a little problem at that moment that’s kind of eating away at me. I’m 13 and I know I’m extremely young to be thinking about romance or having love in my life. But there was a situation that happened a couple months that made me feel really happy. The happiness I’ve ever felt, and I thought that was strange but didn’t think too much of it. I was happy. 

So on this app called “Amino” there are tons of communities. One in particular had my favorite anime/manga so I joined it (in July of 2018). Fast forward to a couple months later (in January of 2019). I met this boy online that claimed he was 15. We started talking and became friends. We had a lot in common when it came to music and life. One day we played a game of +18 truth or dare with a couple of his friends. I dared him to kiss the person he likes online (a different girl), but suddenly he kissed me (online). I was confused, but happy. And I did the same. One thing lead to other and we were in a relationship. It lasted for about a couple weeks until....my dad heard me talking on phone with some of my friends from the app on a voice chat. He got mad and I was banned from ever going back on there again. But before that my mom did attempt to work through this with me but I was too stubborn and very rude. That was when my whole world just crashed. She said I’m never allowed to go back on there and I got my phone taken away from me for a month. I cried and told myself things will okay and if they see good in it then they would let me go back on there. But my hopes were crushed. Those unrealistic thoughts. A childish fantasy that was real and would never happen. 

I wanted to say goodbye to him. Talk to him one last time. I know it’s stupid and extremely immature but I don’t know. I cared about him. I just wished it stayed a bit more longer. 

I know there are dangers to the internet, but still, even after 2 months also 3, it hurts like hell. I just feel empty. 

But I know he’ll forget about me and move on to the next girl...

This is mine :

My girlfriend came visiting. I had prepared dinner for us. The moment was fun filled, we laughed, played fun games, joked about stuffs, smiled at each other, eat then relaxed. The time came for her to leave, it was dark as there was a power failure in the area, so we made use of the torch on my phone, which was not very bright. 

The door entrance is higher than the floor of my room, I was on the entrance while waiting for her to fix up herself. While waiting she gave me a gum to chew, which I resisted, but she persisted. I didn't know what she was up to, sometimes I now feel that I was so dumb with respect to romantic seduction skills. So I took the gum and did chew it. 

She then approached the door and told me about the oil drop (from the food) on her top. I pointed the torch at the distance I was and couldn't find anything of such. She told me to draw closer. Note, she was still in the room, while I was at the door post, that means I was now ""taller"" than her, tho we were really of the same height.

Closer I went but still couldn't see anything. That's when she said I should bend, pointing to her breast region. In curiosity I bent and what I experienced happened at the speed of light:

	  while I  opened my mouth again to say "" I can't find anything...""  I felt her hand on the back of my neck, a pull towards her body , I felt a soft, slender object (that is her tongue) inside my mouth with a movement that created an irresistible sensation all thru my body and a soft lips on my mouth, I couldn't resist it, so I gave in.

Thereafter, she breathed a sigh of relief. ""That was amazing"" I replied, then went ahead to ask for more. Well, at the moment we're no more together.

Two days before the concert, the other schools met at our school to rehearse and get used to how it will be like when we are united. The band teacher that conducted and taught us and the other schools assigned each student/individual to their seats. I looked around who i was sitting by. Because another school had another eighth grade first chair flutist, we had to share first chair (without actually using one chair obviously). That girl that i had to share first chair with was so STUNNING. Shoulder length blonde hair, soft-spoken, and quiet just like me. She even managed to start some nice conversations between us. On the day of the concert, of course everyone had to wear something nice or an aloha shirt. When i saw her again, her looks and my affection for her went from 9/10 to 20/10.

So I’m currently HARDCORE crushing on this girl. Normal stuff, think about her often, (but not exclusively) or anything like “I’d die for my queen and I will protect her” yada yada. Just, I feel a true and genuine connection with her. Here’s the kicker.

She feels the same way.

My brain goes into panic mode. Surely there’s a “but” coming, right? This is too good to be true. Then it hits. She says that while she feels the same about me, she isn’t in the best place right now to be in a relationship and said that even though we’re attracted to eachother, it may be better if we stay “good friends”.

Okay, I can respect that. Over text it’s not the most incredible conversations, and she’s expressed her opinions on PDA and such (mostly negative). However, in private, she wraps herself around my arm, leans on me, kisses my cheek, and so on. 

I haven’t known her for long enough to call it “love”. More so affection. I don’t just want some cheap fling with whatever “hot chick” I can score. I want a truly fulfilling relationship with her, to spend days, weeks, months talking about our favorite shows, music, our lives, and to just be with her. Even past girlfriends have really stuck around because I didn’t want to break up with them, but it’s not like I was invested in the relationships. She’s said she doesn’t want one and I have no problem with that. Even as friends, I still want to spend time with her. 

The only problem is that our time together is limited. Come summer I’ll have to return home and I don’t know that either of us want to try and keep a long distance relationship. In that time I’m trying my hardest to spend as much time as I can now, and I know I’ll see her again. We’ve already made lots of plans. 

It’s a weird feeling knowing that she feels the same but that we just can’t make that happen right now. At the end of the day, to everyone else we’re good friends who just happen to like eachother, but to her, I mean a lot more.

And she means a lot to me.



Am I on the right path here? I would never force her into something she didn’t want, so when I say the “right path” I refer to just what the ideal choices are for me, not necessarily how to ‘make’ her ready.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Titles are hard don’t judge me.)&lt;/p&gt;

I can clean too.. not bragging but I managed to obtain these basic skills at a young age, babysitting included.

So ladies and gents,

Let me know what you think. Is cooking important, a lot of people say takeout is the way to go but it can be pricey and a lazy way out( sometimes if you're busy..but It's good to make your own food in my opinion). Is my skill useful or useless? I have managed to surprise quite a few people, also impressing adults that seem to struggle with cooking for their kids.

Hope I get a good answer!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 1 month away from being 15, I have been my mom&amp;#39;s helper since I was a tot. I started making real dishes when I was 7.. I&amp;#39;ve been practicing, from baking to deep frying. All sorts of dishes, healthy and fattening. The thing is, I&amp;#39;m not super attractive and some guys only seem to want really dumb girls who put out, who can&amp;#39;t heat up ramen to save their life or do anything on their own. I can clean too.. not bragging but I managed to obtain these basic skills at a young age, babysitting included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So ladies and gents,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think. Is cooking important, a lot of people say takeout is the way to go but it can be pricey and a lazy way out( sometimes if you&amp;#39;re busy..but It&amp;#39;s good to make your own food in my opinion). Is my skill useful or useless? I have managed to surprise quite a few people, also impressing adults that seem to struggle with cooking for their kids.&lt;/p&gt;

Met him at my workplace. I was a messed. Had family issues. He invited me over to his place. I lost my virginity to him. We slept 1 more time after that then we lost contact. I dont remember how we lost contact. I even forgot about him. 


Then, he found me. After 4 years. Claiming he ""lost but not forgotten"" me. He said he went back to my work looking for me but I left shortly after we stopped our connection. 

He invited me on a date. Try things out between us. Since we never really had a chance. I initially said yes but changed my mind as for me past is past. No need to bring it to my present.

Then he makes his argument about my way of thinking. I thought about it. Then, agreed to meet him. I won't deny that I was also horny that time. He knows about it that as much as possible I dont want to sleep with him yet but I will likely do. I cant keep my mouth shut. 

We slept together. He assured me it doesnt matter if I sleep with him first date or not. I can do whatever I want. Be real to him.

We saw each other couple more times. I always sleep at his place and he always cuddles with me. Then, I realized I'm starting to like him.

I talked to him about us. Well, I told him I was scared of him because he's good.. too good to be true. Then, we talked. 

Here is some of the excerpt of our convo:

He said he's not good but he was glad I feel that way towards him. Then,

Him: apparently im a fuccboi at least thats what women keep telling me

Me: Is that what you are or what people labelled you?

Him: i dont really do well with commitment i'll be honest. i have bad  history of that

Me: so you dont like commitment?

Him: Not really its too much weight at least rn but ur super chill thats why i havent freaked out i think but i dont want to hurt you at the same time 

blah blah then,

Him: I'm glad you feel that way. I like you too but I just dont want to break your heart if you develop feelings for me. I still want to habg out with you tho but I need to make sure you wont have expectations. Also I need a small break, like 2 weeks to deal with personal issue rn. If you are okay with that we can be good friends as long as emotionally you dont set up disappointment for yourself. You know what I mean?

Me: yeah no problem 

Then I asked him if he is still with his ex. Or anyone exclusively. He said no that they broke up but they talk from time to time.

I told him I would appreciate it if he tells me oncw they get back together or even sleep together since I dont want to cross that line AND we are sleeping with no protection. I know. Bad idea but we both clean tested and all. 

He responded with, ""we can be friends.i'll be honest then you can choose if you dont want to sleep with me"" 

He continued,

""i've had probs with her but she is still bit in my life  tbh but i dont want to lose you coz i havent figured it out yet so id like us to be friends if thats not awkward to you""

Me: So you still have feelings for her and still figuring things out with her but you like me as a friend

Him: I like you as a person



I decided to give him the space and time he is asking. I'm stupid I know. But, I'll take a risk even if I know my chances are not good. That he will ghost me. 100% chances he will definitely ghost me. 

At the end of the convo, he sent me heart emoji. I told him I will let him lead. Let him decide. I dont want to force myself to someone. If he ghosts me, then I move on. If he comes back in 2 weeks, decided that he will be with his ex then kudos to him. For the bravery. For keeping his word. If he comes back in 2 weeks and choose me, well.

Love is something everyone wants and desires. It’s something that we all crave. We all wish to feel loved and to be in love with someone. Love can be described in different ways. There is the way you love your mom or dad. They brought you into this world and would go through anything to protect you. There is the love you feel for a sibling. You would protect them no matter what. Yes, they annoy you and yes you pick on them but you’ll be damned if anyone else does. There’s the love you fee for the rest of your family. They’re your family and no matter how dysfunctional or crazy they will always be your family. Then there’s your friends. You love them like your siblings. You sometimes wish they were your siblings. Then there is the love I’m talking about. Whenever you are this person you smile and get instantly happy. They bring butterflies in your stomach and make you feel okay, even if it is momentarily. They can do no wrong in your eyes. They’re magnificent and beautiful. Love is a weird thing. Love makes you loose all your sense of time and other emotions. You’re trapped in one vision where everything is okay. Love is precious and beautiful. I love, love. You can love someone for their looks. You can love them for their personality, how they make you feel, how they treat you. You can love someone because they’re all of the above. However love can be dark. When you love someone who you knows will never love you it hurts, it eats away at you. You have false hope that maybe one day, but you know it’s not going to happen. You just wish you could be given a chance or be seen in a different light. You just wish you’d be returned with the love you feel. Love is weird and precious. Don’t let it slip away if you can help it. What should you do when the person you’re in love with likes someone who is in love with someone else? Keep your mouth shut and pretend things are fine. Keep smiling because they’re happy and beautiful. They’re happy and you are too because they are... you don’t want to ruin it. Be good to them because they’ve been good to you. Keep it together. Don’t let then get sad again. You love them. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love is something everyone wants and desires. It’s something that we all crave.

After a while, I replied to her story asking about a tv show she watches. She double texts me and says “long time no chat” so I took it she wanted to talk so I talked and I realised we had so much in common. She told me she broke up with her boyfriend. So again, we were going on quite well but I came on too strong so she got distant. A couple months later, she texts me apologising for everything and wants to restart and I felt myself falling for her. She made me feel secure. Bros I even wrote poems for her. And recently she told me that she dosent see a future for us because she still loves her ex. She said, and I quote “you’d make a great bf. I’d love to be with you, but I can’t”. More on, SHES super religious and I’m not and I’m hindu and she’s Christian and she keeps talking about god and how her boyfriend needs to bring her closer to spirituality. So...&lt;/p&gt;

I'm not necessarily shy but I'm not a real 'out their' guy either. flirting has never really been something I think about for as long as I knew it was a thing. I've been described as intimidating and unapproachable-looking and that's why if someone is afraid to maybe start up a conversation, I can be the one to.
I'm in my teens but don't look it, hence the above description. all I'm looking for here is some tips on body language, good conversation starters, maybe how to keep a conversation going and overall, not be a sweaty ball of anxiety when I try to talk to a girl.

I try to keep my smile up in the hope that she understands, that I am actually enjoying this. My heart seems to pound faster with each beat.

She let's go of my hands, they slip back to my side. I stay there, unable to say a word. She just stands there, looking into my eyes with a slight smile.

I told her she deserved better, helped her find help. I should have backed off then, but I didnt. She was hurting, I spent time with her because she said she was lonely, and she felt it blossom into a relationship. I never did, and long story short, I broke her heart. At fhe time, I didn't think I was capable of love, let alone did I want to be in love. 
This is because a year earlier, i was in absolutely what I thought was the greatest relationship of my life. I wanted to marry this girl, she was everything I had ever wanted. I woke up every day with a smile on my face, because i knew I would see her, hear from her. 
Literally, the same day I was starting to look at engagement rings after me and her had talked about engagement, somethimg we both wanted, she called me after I get off work, broke up with me, joined the army, and left my life forever. 
I was blindsided, drank myself into oblivion and closed myself off from the world. In that time I lost two very close family members. It was absoloutely the lowest point of my life so far.

Now, in my last year of my degree, I started going to church again, and through the campus group from the church met possibly one of the most amazing people I have ever met. She from day one has always sat beside me whenever i see her, well into my personal space,- whispered in my ear, helped me find my way into the group. She invites me to things she knows I wouldn't go to otherwise. Shes sweet, innocent and friendly. She embodies everything I see as good and beautiful in the world. Shes a couple years behind me in school, and I'm staring down the barrel of a career that will drag me away from home very often in government service. 

I know, I am falling in love with this girl, because I feel like a damnned child around her. I feel light, i trust people, I let her in. But as good as it feels, i know I cant love her. She deserves someone that doesnt have this baggage I have, someone that shares her sunshiny disposition. Someone innocent like she is, that hasn't given their heart away before, that hasn't broken hearts like I have. She deserves something stable, and as good for her as she is for me. 

Im struggling with this, because selfishly, i want to believe this can work, when I know it can't.

Also really bad at figuring out what information is unnecessary to provide.

So, I'm an 18-year old male, who has the sort of personality that somebody on a discord server I'm on describes as ""Mostly Dandere, but with a lot of deredere."" 

Basically, I've fallen for my best friend, whom I haven't seen in at least a year but we're still quite close. Not just best friend, we were each other's first friends. I first fell for her in elementary school, and she knew about it, and I actually felt heartbreak then, because she and my other best friend were together for a short time, and she friendzoned me as well, but we were such good friends that I accepted it. 

I still do, because I want to keep that friendship above all else, but that first infatuation started to go away in junior high when she changed to the other programme (French Immersion to English), and I had feelings for someone who was in my class for those two years of grades 7 and 8, but looking back on it now it was just an infatuation.

Fast forward to between grades 8 and 9, when she babysat my little sister in the summer (a sister who is only 4 years younger than us, but eh. I think part of it was so that it would be job experience for her, because she's a really good friend of the family as well), and she told me that she saw me as a brother to her. Note that this time I kept my feelings completely hidden.

Anyways, she switched schools right after the beginning of high school, and my feelings began to fade slightly, then they went away again partway through grade 10, when I fell for someone in the same programme as myself (International Baccalaureate). I actually first really took notice of her in geography for an assignment we were paired together to work on....

Anyways, I never had the courage for the entire time I had feelings for her (So grade 10 until graduation, basically. So grade 10 until 7 months ago.) And actually last October I learned that she is asexual, and apparently it was a commonly known thing? Also I had tried to be really obvious about my feelings for her, while also doing my best to hide them. Kind of got overshadowed by the fact that I'm already really polite, I feel like.

Anyways, I never ended up confessing, but I'm sure she knew although she never spoke to me about it. Other's knew for sure though. ANYWAYS, She-Who-Now-Currently-Unkowingly-Has-My-Heart-In-Her-Possession said that she would try to make it to my graduation ceremony (She couldn't; she got called in to work), and just the suggestion that we could spend some time together, well, we still haven't managed to meet up, but my feelings for her are very strong. Whenever I think of her I get this pleasant warm feeling in my chest.

We do text each other on occasion, and I actually talk to her about this, letting her know as much as I can without letting her know that it's her. (Example: Because I kept my feelings for her hidden the second time, I could and did tell her that this is the third time I've fallen for the person I've fallen for.)

But now, well, I'm not the most social person. I can't remember the last time I've really spent time with my peers. I mostly spend my time playing FFXIV with my dad, or going on Discord or watching YouTube or playing other video games. Or browsing Reddit. I've been doing lots of that recently.

Actually, I both kind of hope she does / doesn't go on this subreddit. Because she'll either see it as a huge coincidence, or she'll put the pieces together. I don't know if I want that to happen. I want to confess to her in person, and sooner rather than later, but at the same time, if she puts the pieces together herself then I don't need to worry about confessing, and she can't get upset about figuring it out on her own, but it feels wrong to not confess, and the idea of confessing not in person really doesn't sit well with me.

So, uh, I guess what I'm asking is, uh, what do I do?

Note: I don't currently go to university but I'm planning on it soon, actually need to apply soon, but I don't really know what I want to go into, but my only social interaction outside the house is at work, and I only interact with my co-workers (I work in E-commerce Fulfillment.)

So yeah. What should I do? 

Edit: Huh. Doesn't look like I mentioned that she already is happily in a relationship, so I know and accept that she doesn't reciprocate my romantic feelings.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First time posting on this subreddit and mobile poster, also Canadian.

First thing I should say before I continue with this story is: yes, we have sex but we only have sex once or twice a night before calling it quits and doing other stuff together.

When we first hung out the first few times I thought ""wow, this is my dream guy, but kind of sad he won't like me"" since a lot of times that I have met someone who embodies all of the physical standards of mine end up finding someone else that embodies their needs and wants. But he's been consistently with me and telling me to accept myself and all of this positive stuff. I did tell him that I struggle with seasonal depression (and with my depression comes anxiety) and he's been trying to help me out with it lately by being there for me and getting me out of a routine that makes me feel like I'm stuck in an endless cycle.

Anyways, I keep straying from this story. There is a point to it. He's this 6 foot something 200 something pound guy who keeps in shape and he's sweet, funny, caring and overall amazing. But this dude keeps telling me ""I'm not looking for a relationship. I'm not looking to date"" and neither am I. I broke up with my first long term boyfriend back in October (I really tried the whole long distance but that was out of the door the moment he left back in August. I was already emotionally detached from him back in May of 2018) and I'm not looking to date at the moment. I think I'm more of exploring the different people in my life and having options before I date again. Well, we both established that we aren't looking to date and how we're just riding the waves.

That works for him. He likes not having labels, and enjoys being free and I need a little structure. I need to know if he's into me or if he thinks he is, or if he isn't. I'm not sure if it's me being dense but he does a lot of these cute things to me. I kind of just assumed they were how he treats every other girl he hangs out with, but he kisses my cheek and forehead a lot of the time, he hugs me and he'll give me kisses on my neck, and he smiles and laughs a lot when we're together and doing nothing. And he does this thing where we lay down he'll kind of stare at me as I talk and then he'll rub my ear as a comfort thing he's been doing since he was young. Sometimes he'll move my hair out of my face and he does this thing where he likes to put his weight on me and kind of hold me for a bit before I move.

Whenever I came over and he would play a game I would be quiet because he would be talking to his friends, but lately he's been talking to his friends and me at the same time. I found it pretty weird when he first started doing it, because he did this thing when he took my socks off and it surprised me, so I thought that it was really weird, so one day he reached over towards my leg and I had thought that he was going to take my socks off again, but no, he laughed and thought I was weird, so he said in his mic: ""Dude, she thought that I was going to take her socks off. she's so weird"" and in the same day he goes ""what's a good place in the city to take a girl out on a date?"" then turned to wink at me!

Also, back to my sleep overs with him, I left a hair clip at his place and then left makeup wipes and contact solutions and he says he enjoys that I leave my stuff at his place and that it reminds him of me or something along those lines and it really tripped me up. He's been saying a lot of these things that gets my hopes up. And our vibes that happen between us when we're together is amazing. He seems into me and when we hang out, we exist together and we exist in our own world and sometimes he know's how I feel-- I think. Like, when he looks at me he can feel how I feel towards him.

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I keep straying from this story. There is a point to it. He&amp;#39;s this 6 foot something 200 something pound guy who keeps in shape and he&amp;#39;s sweet, funny, caring and overall amazing. But this dude keeps telling me &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not looking for a relationship. I&amp;#39;m not looking to date&amp;quot; and neither am I. I broke up with my first long term boyfriend back in October (I really tried the whole long distance but that was out of the door the moment he left back in August. I was already emotionally detached from him back in May of 2018) and I&amp;#39;m not looking to date at the moment. I think I&amp;#39;m more of exploring the different people in my life and having options before I date again. Well, we both established that we aren&amp;#39;t looking to date and how we&amp;#39;re just riding the waves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That works for him. He likes not having labels, and enjoys being free and I need a little structure. I need to know if he&amp;#39;s into me or if he thinks he is, or if he isn&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;m not sure if it&amp;#39;s me being dense but he does a lot of these cute things to me. I kind of just assumed they were how he treats every other girl he hangs out with, but he kisses my cheek and forehead a lot of the time, he hugs me and he&amp;#39;ll give me kisses on my neck, and he smiles and laughs a lot when we&amp;#39;re together and doing nothing. And he does this thing where we lay down he&amp;#39;ll kind of stare at me as I talk and then he&amp;#39;ll rub my ear as a comfort thing he&amp;#39;s been doing since he was young. Sometimes he&amp;#39;ll move my hair out of my face and he does this thing where he likes to put his weight on me and kind of hold me for a bit before I move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I came over and he would play a game I would be quiet because he would be talking to his friends, but lately he&amp;#39;s been talking to his friends and me at the same time. I found it pretty weird when he first started doing it, because he did this thing when he took my socks off and it surprised me, so I thought that it was really weird, so one day he reached over towards my leg and I had thought that he was going to take my socks off again, but no, he laughed and thought I was weird, so he said in his mic: &amp;quot;Dude, she thought that I was going to take her socks off. she&amp;#39;s so weird&amp;quot; and in the same day he goes &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s a good place in the city to take a girl out on a date?&amp;quot; then turned to wink at me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, back to my sleep overs with him, I left a hair clip at his place and then left makeup wipes and contact solutions and he says he enjoys that I leave my stuff at his place and that it reminds him of me or something along those lines and it really tripped me up. He&amp;#39;s been saying a lot of these things that gets my hopes up. And our vibes that happen between us when we&amp;#39;re together is amazing. He seems into me and when we hang out, we exist together and we exist in our own world and sometimes he know&amp;#39;s how I feel-- I think. Like, when he looks at me he can feel how I feel towards him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My overall question is: Am I getting played by this dream guy of mine or nah?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sorry for the super long writing without a point. &lt;/p&gt;

I have a real life situation that I feel I've fallen into. Where to start. In 6th grade I met a boy, he was sweet, we talked and eventually started writing notes and letters to each other just back and forth. He was my first crush ever. We were preteens so I didn't think too much of it. One day in band I got an announcement on our pa telling me to pack my things I was going home. As I walked past the courtyard to the front of the school I passed by him. It was pure luck. We exchanged letters that we had on us yet again without realizing it was the last time. I looked cold so he gave me his jacket and said to give it back whenever. Unknown to me.. I got in the car with my little sister and my parents told us to get comfortable and that we would be on the road a few hours. Later we arrived in Austin in a new home. I cried. I read his last letter wrapped in his jacket and never felt so betrayed by my parents and lonely.
Time passed and in the start of high school we connected on MySpace. He found my name and sent me a friend request. I was happy again. At one point our friendship felt so good that I wanted to ask if he would be my long distance boyfriend and we could see each other when I would visit my aunt and uncle in his town where they all lived. Where I used to live.. But I backed out. I was too afraid of the response. We talked on and off for years. Both graduated high school. And in 2012 I broke up with a boy I had been dating for two years. I reconnected with my friend and we talked for a while and everything seemed great. But we fell off somehow. Later in 2013 I tried to message him through Facebook and got a nasty response from a female saying that he was about to get married and have a kid that was not yet born. So I left it alone and cried to myself thinking this was just life.
As the years passed I would get messages on Facebook from him asking how I was and we would let each other in on our lives. We talked about his marriage and his son and the many countries he visited while in the army. I had been in a relationship and living situation with a man myself so we were both growing up.
Now.. At this point it has been almost fifteen years since knowing him. I greatly consider him my best friend. I feel as if I can trust him completely and with anything I tell him. I got a message one day saying he wanted to talk to me about something so we did. He was unhappy in his marriage and was depressed. The advice I gave him was to simply do what is best to save it for the sake of his son and if he didn't feel happy after a few months then talk to his wife about it to work it out so that their son doesn't see how his parents are unhappy. It really affects children. He did so and months passed when he told me it wasn't working. He tried and tried and nothing. So he left her while making an agreement for divorce and a settlement of money he would send monthly as well as how often he would visit and call and face time their son. I wasn't happy that it was the result, but that's life.
As for me, my six year relationship is already at an end we are waiting to have the money to get our own places and move away from each other.
So around the same time me and my friend both are single and talking again. He's still going through his divorce and I'm still living with my ex until things are resolved.
The problem here is I am afraid at this point. At the beginning of the year we met each other for the first time since that last day in 6th grade. I no longer had his letters or jacket.. When he met me in my town we walked and talked. Ate a pizza. He is so handsome and still as sweet as ever. This past month during our talks and video chats he has said he loves me while both drunk and sober. He drinks with his brother which isn't a problem. But I'm worried because he says this over the phone but not either of the times we have seen each other. After our first encounter we met again when he drove almost 7 hours just to see me. No other reason. And no one has ever done such a thing for me before. It felt very romantic and like he really cares enough about me.
Now.. We feel the same about each other and have said this both through text and face to face. And I'm worried that while we are sorting out our situations we will fall apart over the possible six month or longer wait. I've always loved him and I almost feel like we have a magical story that spans over a decade. I'm not sure if I can still trust him in the same way I did as a kid. We're adults now. And as much as I love him that doesn't mean I'm not scared of what might happen or if I can even really expect a man to wait at least six months to be with me. Will he even wait? Or run after a woman in a bar?
Really the reason I posted this is to see what other people think of the situation. I kind of feel bad.. I mean he's still married. I'm still living with my ex for the time being. Are we wrong for this? Was I the cause of his failed marriage? Can I even trust him after all this time to be 100% honest and real with me? No relationship has ever worked for me and this is causing me to panic. I honestly don't know what to do about it now. I would be crushed and broken if this didn't work out simply because I feel as if he may be the one. We have seen each other twice this month and it has been very mild. We have kissed but nothing more. When we kissed for the first time it's like time stopped. I didn't want that moment to ever end. Now I'm left feeling like a pathetic hopeless romantic saying that I feel like I've found the one. Yet I'm so scared and worried that I may be over thinking the entire thing. When all I really want is a secure feeling knowing that I won't need to worry and that I can trust him. There are no guarantees.

We've been together for 5 years, seeing another every few months at best. We mostly saw another *once or twice* a year. We are only *15 minutes apart* distance-wise.

In the beginning we saw another almost every day since we were in school. After I graduated I went to college 80 miles away (commuting by train). He broke his leg shortly after. He was bedridden for about 2 - 3 years due to surgeries (got a rod put in w/ nails, but they hurt, so he slowly got them taken out and had to heal over and over again). Neither of us had a car.

As a result, most of our relationship has happened on FaceBook.

Due to this, we barely have any memories, are rarely intimate, and to make things worse he's someone who has anxiety about being in a relationship - and doing ANY outdoor activity (due to fear of socializing, breaking another bone, or preferring to be indoors). He was a very sheltered child, which may play a role.

I got a car last year and though it would improve things, but his anxiety has proved otherwise.

Recently we started seeing each other more (once every 2 weeks-ish), but we always go to the movies because his anxiety stops him from doing anything else. I've offered alternative ways to spend time in order to bond with him, but he's never willing to try new things. It's almost as bad as it was before.

I've broken up with him a few times due to the sheer unhappiness, loneliness, and disappointment of our relationship. We always fall back together because we care about another, but we are always on a different page when it comes to everything.

I contemplate whether this is a real relationship or one worth having. Any thoughts? We are very different people. I'm starting to realize that, as much as I love him, he may always hold me back if I keep falling back in.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me and my boyfriend are high school sweethearts, but our relationship is far from perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

My fiancé and I have been together for 6 years and engaged for just under 5. It was literally like a week before the 5th anniversary of our engagement that he broke it off. 
We hadn’t been intimate in 2 months, and not for my lack of trying (or begging). I could feel him pulling away, and I tried a sexy maneuver. He shut it down and told me we needed to talk. 

Now some back story; my fiancé suffers from mild agoraphobia and a pretty severe anxiety disorder. He’s held a job for the last 2 years and is going back to school to get his GED, he even has his own car now. But for the longest time I had to take care of him, at the expense of living my life. And I knew this going in, I did it because I was so in love with him nothing else mattered. I never once made him feel like I resented him, because I didn’t. My philosophy was that if you can’t handle the bad times then you don’t deserve the good times. And let me make this clear, when it was good it was so good. Like the movies. When it was bad... you get the picture. 

So he says he wants to take a step back, he feels like he’s dragging me down with him and that he needs to get his life in order before we move forward. And on some levels I get it, I really do. He’s got old school values, he believes the man should be the protector and provider and he feels he hasn’t been that for me. He’s about to be 28 and still hasn’t made anything of himself and hasn’t achieved his dreams. So like I said I get it. What I don’t get is why that means we had to break off the engagement. We weren’t in a rush, yes I have been bringing up that I wanted to talk about setting a date but nothing was set in stone and I wasn’t being pushy. We’d been engaged for almost 5 years, and now he has doubts? It just doesn’t add up to me. I would be inclined to think there was someone else but here’s the clincher... he only goes to work and school and comes home. He never goes out without me. He doesn’t have time. He’s too tired to go out. Etc. 

We’re still together and trying to work on things, but it’s been a month and I think I’ve made up my mind. I’m going to give him just under a year. If we aren’t re-engaged, or haven’t made significant progress by 1/1/2020... I’m done. I love him with every fiber of my being and I’m pretty sure it would kill a pretty big part of me to do it but I’d leave him. I owe it to him and myself to see if this thing can work, I’ve put so much effort into this, being there for him, being his comfort, and loving him that I just can’t throw it away. But ever since I’ve come for this decision I feel different. I still love him the same and all those statements are still true but... it’s almost like a weight has been lifted off me. I can’t imagine my life without him in it but lately I’ve been thinking about it...Making plans about what I’m going to do when it happens...thinking about being single...
I feel horrible and relieved at the same time. 
What do I do? Am I doing the right thing? I don’t know what to think anymore...

Hello everyone!

I have a question. My boyfriend and I are both in our late 20’s, we’ve been together 1.5 years – it has been a relationship filled with a lot of love, travel, great memories and bettering each other. Initially we’d make jokes about what we’d name our children, but it was never serious discussion. We both share the same values on wanting to have children and be married. 

Yesterday I brought up the topic, asking him if he saw a future for us. He said logically he’d want to marry me, however, right now he feels like he has not yet got a direction for his life and there are certain ‘circumstances’ that he feels still have to be sorted, so he cannot give me a ‘definitive’ answer about our future. As you can imagine, this made me feel upset. He says he loves me and that ‘we’ll be fine’, let’s continue to grow, that I’m the most unique girl he has ever been with etc. He says I’m a great person and that if we didn’t end up getting married, it would be his loss etc. But what does all that mean?

He then asked me, how long I would be willing to wait, to which I responded – I didn’t know/have timelines because honestly I’ve never been in this situation before and have never put an expiry date on when I think I should get married. So I couldn’t answer that question. He has often said he wanted to be with me long term, but that was never clear as to whether it meant marriage or not.

From the above, does anyone have any interpretation or thoughts/perspectives on my situation? I really love him and want to be with him; but I also have the fear of ‘wasting’ time. At the same time, I keep thinking, if I walk away prematurely, what if I regret it, what if I leave too soon/early? There’s a whole world of uncertainty out there. The whole thing just makes me very upset. Do I wait and see? Do I go through the heart-break and hope I’ll meet someone else? I can’t imagine life without him, I love him to bits and I’m not ready to let him go, I don’t want to let him go. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

 I've only been in a couple of relationships and now that I'm close to thirty I'm not at all interested in meeting someone for a long term or short term relationship. I have an average life with friends, family, my hobbies and work so a lot of people ask ""what about dating"" or ""go try dating apps"". I've done online dating and speed dating but nothing clicks even if I do end up on a date or two with someone. Its just one of those things that never seem to cross my mind on an average day. Sometimes it feels like if I don't try and find someone I'm left out or people say that you'll find someone because its an important part of being an adult. I know all that but there is something about dating and finding romance that feeling like a horrible mistake or the person feels more like an intruder rather than someone who I want in my life. I don't really want romantic dinners or holding hands in public. If anything I'd rather my partner treat me like a best friend. I don't even know if I want to be a wife. I mean I'm already looking into buying a house in the next couple of years and a year ago my coworker said to me ""What about the husband and kids, you should wait until that happens first."" None of that crossed my mind and its still not a concern. Even my mom said she felt sorry for me for feeling this way and that kind of hurt as it made me feel abnormal. 

So I want to know, is this a normal thing. Is it normal that some people just not want to date and want to be independent or at least not want a husband or wife?  I know that asexuality exists but I'm not sure if I fall into that category.

Also, it’s important to note that I do care for him tremendously and like him for him. He’s not the cutest (I know) or the brightest, but he brings me so much happiness that I forget all of that. Maybe that’s love, I’m not sure. But he makes my heart feel so happy. I’m not sure. If anyone has gone through any similar situations, lmk. &lt;/p&gt;

So I'm in no way a 'romantic' person. I'm in a relationship with a girl I met in high school, we recently had our 4 year anniversary and I love her to bits. We barely argue, we make each other laugh, we live together and everything's great, but we're definitely one of those couples who don't show PDA, and who on a night, instead of snuggling up and having cute chats and stuff we'd be more likely to smoke a joint and watch some Netflix comedy.

I've never considered myself romantic like I said, but that's why I need help with this next bit.

We just recently moved into a block of flats, and I swear to god this is going to sound like it's from a Richard Curtis movie but it's honestly true. \*deep breath\* ... I spoke to a girl on my floor for probably 30 seconds as we were waiting for the lift, and I think I'm in love with her.

All I know is that I saw her smile and something inside me went off (not that!). I feel like I need to tell someone, so here I am. I can't tell my long-term girlfriend I'm infatuated with someone else, least of all someone I don't even know and who lives down the hall from us.

Does this make me a bad person? Is this a sign my relationship isn't working? I've always considered myself to be happy and we have a healthy relationship like I said. We don't argue, sex life is good etc. But what I feel for this girl I have not felt for my girlfriend (nor for anyone ever). It literally was like love at first sight, an insane notion as far as I've always been concerned but I guess ultimately it's just chemicals in the brain right?

In the morning I hope I bump into her again (I haven't yet) and I saw her leave the flat with some guy the other day (her boyfriend I presume) and it crushed me. How? I don't even know her! All I know is this better pass, because I can't be in an honest committed relationship when I feel like this for another girl.

Please someone tell me you've experienced something similar and it'll pass, or that I'm not crazy. WHAT IS THIS? What should I do? I tell my girlfriend everything but I can't tell her this. Please give me some kind of advice!

We barely argue, we make each other laugh, we live together and everything&amp;#39;s great, but we&amp;#39;re definitely one of those couples who don&amp;#39;t show PDA, and who on a night, instead of snuggling up and having cute chats and stuff we&amp;#39;d be more likely to smoke a joint and watch some Netflix comedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never considered myself romantic like I said, but that&amp;#39;s why I need help with this next bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just recently moved into a block of flats, and I swear to god this is going to sound like it&amp;#39;s from a Richard Curtis movie but it&amp;#39;s honestly true. *deep breath* ... I spoke to a girl on my floor for probably 30 seconds as we were waiting for the lift, and I think I&amp;#39;m in love with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I know is that I saw her smile and something inside me went off (not that!). I feel like I need to tell someone, so here I am. I can&amp;#39;t tell my long-term girlfriend I&amp;#39;m infatuated with someone else, least of all someone I don&amp;#39;t even know and who lives down the hall from us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this make me a bad person? Is this a sign my relationship isn&amp;#39;t working? I&amp;#39;ve always considered myself to be happy and we have a healthy relationship like I said. We don&amp;#39;t argue, sex life is good etc. But what I feel for this girl I have not felt for my girlfriend (nor for anyone ever). It literally was like love at first sight, an insane notion as far as I&amp;#39;ve always been concerned but I guess ultimately it&amp;#39;s just chemicals in the brain right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning I hope I bump into her again (I haven&amp;#39;t yet) and I saw her leave the flat with some guy the other day (her boyfriend I presume) and it crushed me. How? I don&amp;#39;t even know her! All I know is this better pass, because I can&amp;#39;t be in an honest committed relationship when I feel like this for another girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please someone tell me you&amp;#39;ve experienced something similar and it&amp;#39;ll pass, or that I&amp;#39;m not crazy. WHAT IS THIS? What should I do? I tell my girlfriend everything but I can&amp;#39;t tell her this. Please give me some kind of advice! Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

I have never been someone who was good at waiting for the guy to make the first move, and to be honest it hasn’t really worked out in my favor. My friends say that my methods are too aggressive. “Let them come to you.” The only thing that runs through my mind though is ‘what if they never do.’ 

How is someone supposed to know you like them if you do not say it? If I decide not to take initiative and nothing ever happens then I will always wonder, what if.

I like a boy. I have not felt this kind of giddy sensation in years. I just have no clue if he is even interest in me.

Here is some background. He is in my class. There is exactly one week left in the semester and only one day left of the class I have with him. After this I will probably never see him again. I only have two options, make the first move, or move on and keep him as a crush of the past. 

I want to tell him how I feel, but I fear that my confession will most likely come as a surprise. We have only ever texted in group messages and I have never hung out with him outside of class. I almost feel stupid for obsessing over a guy that I guess I do not really know.

The first day of class I saw him and I just felt it. It’s not something over the top like love at first sight or anything, but I felt that spark. The more I got to know him in class the harder I fell, but he has no idea.

The worst thing that could happen is ultimately rejection. I have been able to handle rejection in the past. It doesn’t feel good. It never does. However, I have never been rejected by a boy I truly have feelings for. 

I’m scared of being rejected, but I’m also scared that I will never talk to him again. He makes me excited to go to class, which is insane because college kinda sucks. It is hard and stressful, but everyday when I had that class I felt happy. 

I was planning on texting him when the semester ended. However, I want to go into my last day of class with him knowing how I feel. Too bad I do not have the balls to actually do it.

I was hoping that if I waited long enough maybe he would eventually make some kind of move or a sign that he is at all interested, but he hasn’t. This means that my confession will most likely end in rejection. If it does then I just have to remember that one day someone will want me and this guy just was not the one. It will happen. I am just tired of waiting for the day when it does.

Update: for anyone who wants to know: I asked him to hang out and this is his exact response “Yeah I’d be down to. But I don’t want to give you the wrong impression. I’m not looking for anything “ 
So yeah I’m currently feeling pretty bad. He said we will talk more about it in class on Wednesday 
Thanks for the advice everyone at least now I know 😕

   The ability to think in a practical way and make sensible decisions is the definition given to the term commonsense by the OALD (8TH Edition).

   Like water and oil, it's quite amazing that some people still believe in this day and age, that the term has no place when it comes to pure, genuine, profound and sincere love, that if sense and reasoning is very much alive and kicking in the relationship, that the relationship cannot be said to exist based on true love, that true love makes one think, say and do stupid things, like if one isn't making among other wise choices, unreasonable choices, then one is most probably not is love. Because thought and reason tend to give way for the vehicle of love when it's fully in motion to pass through, it is important therefore that one teaches oneself by training the brain to prepare proactively and not reactively to the eventual swift and forceful passage of the vehicle of love in other for the strong emotion of love not to continue to overpower the very essential commonsense when one is in love. 

   Every living organism no matter how infinitesimal has an organ for reasoning commonly known as the brain.

We all look forward as we move ahead in life. We seldom look backwards to see what's behind us because looking forward is the most essential part of moving forward. Imagine having to look forward while walking or driving on a busy street. even if you have a justifiable reason for doing so. You'll most likely end up creating more problems than  solutions for yourself. Also, although we tell ourselves that we do not choose the person with whom we fall in love, it just happens randomly, I never really saw myself liking someone like him or her, etc. The truth is that we do very well choose that person we like, the person with whom we fall in love, subconsciously however and not necessarily consciously. The subconscious act of choosing the person we're attracted to and would like to date is based on our soft spots, opinions, views, ideologies, wants and desires, all of which can be said to be based on our level of wisdom, knowledge, exposure, experiences and enlightenment.

LOve oNlY mAtTeRs In rEAl LifE"" just listen...

I have an online best friend, I have been talking with him for just over 2 months now.
We met on an online game and we progressively developed from texting to talking on the mic to doing face time occasionally.

We are around the same age range (I'm 3 years older) recently I felt myself feel rather connected to him. I trust him with a lot... As does he trust me.

So here's my dilemma...
I felt myself falling in love with him...I hate long distance relationship...they make me feel rather lonely...

He lives in Portugal and I live in the UK. He said once him and I finish education he's moving down to England.

I stupidly said to him tonight ""I want to stop talking"" you can imagine his distress as he relies in me for self esteem and he feels very connected (to the extent that he admitted to crying once I said this)
He was confused so I explained that I didn't want to fall in love with him and I felt myself doing just that. I explained I had a long distance relationship before but the last guy cheated on me....my trust for LDR's decreased then...
He then promised me that he would not cheat 100%.

He says ""I love you"" a lot...(sounds dumb but whatever lol) he says he didn't know that I liked him and he was happy...he was very very happy once we were talking on mic only one hour after having the long discussion about my last LDR.

How can I bring it up to ask if we are dating...I'm so confused...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you all start saying &amp;quot;nO. LOve oNlY mAtTeRs In rEAl LifE&amp;quot; just listen...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an online best friend, I have been talking with him for just over 2 months now.
We met on an online game and we progressively developed from texting to talking on the mic to doing face time occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are around the same age range (I&amp;#39;m 3 years older) recently I felt myself feel rather connected to him. I trust him with a lot... As does he trust me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s my dilemma...
I felt myself falling in love with him...I hate long distance relationship...they make me feel rather lonely...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He lives in Portugal and I live in the UK. He said once him and I finish education he&amp;#39;s moving down to England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stupidly said to him tonight &amp;quot;I want to stop talking&amp;quot; you can imagine his distress as he relies in me for self esteem and he feels very connected (to the extent that he admitted to crying once I said this)
He was confused so I explained that I didn&amp;#39;t want to fall in love with him and I felt myself doing just that. I explained I had a long distance relationship before but the last guy cheated on me....my trust for LDR&amp;#39;s decreased then...
He then promised me that he would not cheat 100%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although he never did specify... I&amp;#39;m confused...
Would you say we are dating now...
He says &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot; a lot...(sounds dumb but whatever lol) he says he didn&amp;#39;t know that I liked him and he was happy...he was very very happy once we were talking on mic only one hour after having the long discussion about my last LDR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I bring it up to ask if we are dating...I&amp;#39;m so confused...&lt;/p&gt;

Should It Be Blind?

 From the sentimental point of view, one might say yes. True love is blind. But commonsensically, true love does not necessarily have to be blind.
 
   Love itself has to do with sentiments - feelings based on emotions. If one claims to love someone or something, one has automatically declared his sentiments for that thing or that person and will therefore react and relate towards it/him/her accordingly. But because when true love is blind it can be more destructive than productive, it is commonsensically unadvisable. This does not in anyway take anything away from the fact that true love being blind implies that it's unconditional and anything short of it may arguably be said not to be true love.
 
   In summary true love by simple definition is blind but doesn't necessarily have to be. It can be blind but not reckless nor careless (as is characteristic of people who are literally blind). Nothing beats true love mixed with a good dose of commonsense. One must therefore  learn to be...

She woke up and saw her brother sleeping on his writing table in the room. They were not rich enough to have a large house with many rooms, they only could afford this small flat with one room and squeezed everything the needed in it. He usually slept on the table while writing when could not fight with the sleep any longer. Last night he worked for longer hours and gave in to sleep, she could not tell when because she never woke as late as he. She approached him, kissed his head and took a page he fell sleep writing last night, he had no work and contributed to income only through writing short stories online, sometimes they got long and he had to finish them on another day. The page was not completely filled so she thought maybe she can peak into the ending of the story and began to read because there was still time for her to be ready and go to work.

""How can love for something drive you crazy day by day slowly, slowly. When you really want something but it is just out of your range.

It is same with me dear sister. I know that you have brought me up and have been taking care of me ever since our parents and are like a mother to me. You worked two jobs only to feed me when I was little and unable to earn any money, hell I still am, and these writings are not very well accepted because somehow my own self creeps into them, my passion is expressed and society does not like it.

I have to say something to someone, anyone, since I couldn't say it to you I started writing hence most of my stories base on the subject. I am sorry for hiding it, but I feared that you would hate me for what and how I feel about you. But this feeling is just uncontrollable and I can't hold it any longer but before I do anything that would discern your disapproval, I am going to go away from you. I am going to leave you, because I can't stop loving you.

Her heart was thundering her hands were trembling, her body was shaking her head was aching. Tears dripped from her eyes as she realized that her brother was deeply in love with her but she could not respond in kind. She had to maintain herself and him as well, otherwise the society would not let them live. They will be driven away and hunted down. As many before them were hung, burnt alive, thrown in pits and executed in most horrible ways thinkable. They will forever be named demons and children as abomination their legacy a curse, they will not find a place to hid and there will be no escape from their plight. She shook her brother up to wake him up but he did not move and his head slipped from table. Horrified she looked at him for a second and began to sob. She dare not touch him and only hoped that it was not true, she only hopped that he was alive. She wanted to call his name out loud but she had lost her voice, frozen in her step her body was paralyzed. When she broke off it she leapt on him checked his pulse, tried to find it, failed and let out a howl. Her body began to convulse rapidly and fell on him, face close to his. She closed her eyes, put her arm on his head and kissed him on lips.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;She woke up and saw her brother sleeping on his writing table in the room. They were not rich enough to have a large house with many rooms, they only could afford this small flat with one room and squeezed everything the needed in it. He usually slept on the table while writing when could not fight with the sleep any longer. Last night he worked for longer hours and gave in to sleep, she could not tell when because she never woke as late as he. She approached him, kissed his head and took a page he fell sleep writing last night, he had no work and contributed to income only through writing short stories online, sometimes they got long and he had to finish them on another day. The page was not completely filled so she thought maybe she can peak into the ending of the story and began to read because there was still time for her to be ready and go to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How can love for something drive you crazy day by day slowly, slowly. When you really want something but it is just out of your range. Like a good video game for a kid who passes by the video store every day and desire it, looks at it, but just can&amp;#39;t buy it. If that happens to you long enough you will eventually give into madness. It is same with me dear sister. I know that you have brought me up and have been taking care of me ever since our parents and are like a mother to me. You worked two jobs only to feed me when I was little and unable to earn any money, hell I still am, and these writings are not very well accepted because somehow my own self creeps into them, my passion is expressed and society does not like it. But what can I do, I can&amp;#39;t keep it in.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Mom, thanks for making me a strong woman who knows how to think logically and independently. Thank you for showing me how to work a kitchen, clean until my fingers cracked and how to place on perfect makeup. 

For showing me I can be as smart, nerdy, and confident as I want...unless there's a man around.... 

Training your daughter to become an idiot in sight of an attractive man to appear cute. Scolding her whenever she beat a boy at a video game or match of wits. Beating her into repeating sexist phrases about women in kitchens and  men needing to be worshipped the moment they walked through the door. 

Thanks mom, all that worked and now your 27 year old daughter had to go on a damn trip to discover herself and struggles with men. Believing she will never be considered beautiful because you told her that her apparence was lacking anything desirable. Telling her to submit so she can be loved. Your daughter now runs to becomes a studdering fool whenever an attractive male even appears near her! Did you know your daughter hasn't dated in 5 years because she enjoys seeing a man clean and has been conditioned to think that's wrong!!! 

Or how about teaching your daughter to worship the male body in bed? Forgot about your needs and desires, it's all about them! Well now your daughter has developed a BDSM fetish and panics whenever she is touched! oh yeah, your daughter can't stand casual touch because you groomed her to accept any man's advances no matter how creepy! 

Thanks mom. I enjoyed this journey of self discovery. I worked out some of these problems, kind of. I still adore men and worship their form like a pervert behind closed doors. However, your daughter has gotten burned and has not experienced being loved...

She was treated as a pet in all her relationships. She was kept because she cooked, clean, and couldn't say no. 

She's afraid now mom. She's afraid she will end up alone, used or unwanted. She hid her real self from friends because you trained her to hide if she was around people. 

You're daughter is 27, working on her masters, creating beautiful works of art, beating up monsters in table top rpgs and video games. She talks about her love of books and philosophy now. She loves metal and European pop. She is even considered a weeaboo, like you would ever know what that is. 

But she is very lonely. Most of her friends are married now or in a relationship. She doesn't like hanging out because she feels like the 3rd wheel. She still can't talk to guys, it's almost painful. Sometimes she thinks about those past boyfriends and wonders if it was because she stopped listening to you is why she will always be alone. 

She hasn't felt loved.

We had had a wonderful time together. Out and about in Atlanta just enjoying the city. It felt great to have a friend. Someone I could go out with or sit on the couch and talk about nothing with. I felt comfortable with him, but I also had my reservations. I knew he liked me. The way I would catch him stealing glances. Or the way he would flash me that sweet little crooked smile whenever our eyes would meet. But I just couldn't say anything, and as shy as he was I doubted he would either. Nevertheless, I was plagued by my insecurities. My last relationship ended in complete and utter heartbreak. I had loved in a way I never before. But he told me he could never be happy with me and like that he was gone. Just a memory. A love lost. A culmination of what I foolishly thought was forever, ending in a puddle of tears. 

Fast forward, so here I am walking down peachtree street. Laughing and feeling comfortable with this man. The chemistry between us almost as thick as the notorious Atlanta humidity. But whenever I would look at him and feel so alive, so enthralled, I couldn't help but feel afraid. I couldn't imagine another broken heart. I wouldn't make it through another broken heart.

 ""Did you hear that?"" I said. ""Yeah"" he replied ""it sounded like thunder."" We lock eyes for a quick second and both look away as we sheepishly giggle. ""If only he knew how fast my heart was beating right now. ""That wasn't  thunder fool that was my heart beating loudly for you, duh."" I say jokingly.
In his crazy good English accent he replies, ""Oh, well my dear pardon my mistake. How could I possibly confuse the sound of thunder with that of the human heart.""

""It's ok,” I say, “just don't let it happen again."" I turn to look at him again we smile and I wink. 
It was silent for a moment, however it seemed like an eternity. I thought to myself,  ""Quick Summer, say something."" 

""Wouldn’t it be funny if it started to......"" No sooner had I opened my big mouth did the rain begin to pour down on us. Why couldn't I just have enjoyed the silence? He grabs my hand and we make a mad dash for the nearest covering. 

Feeling both annoyed and excited, I scream. ""Ahhhh, this sort of stuff only happens in movies, what the hell!"" Then it hits us, uncontrollable laughter. There we are just taking it all in laughing because honestly, we were silly enough to go without an umbrella. In a mocking English accent  recounting an earlier conversation and between bursts of laughter I say to him, ""I checked my weather app, there is only a 20% chance of rain, we don't need an umbrella."" 

I laugh again, this time my forehead gently rests on his shoulder. ""Oh shoot"" I think to myself, ""when and how did we end up in this sort of embrace?"" That is when I realized I was the only one still laughing. I could feel his hands slowly tightening around my waist. His embrace was sending chills down my lower back straight to my toes. But I couldn't bring myself to look at him. As my hands rested on his shoulders and his hands wrapped around my waist, I stood there staring down at my feet. Listening to the rain pour and the thunder clap. Why couldn't I look at him? I was afraid that the moment I looked into his eyes, he would be able to read my thoughts. He would discover my secrets.He would see the past hurts and insecurities that have kept me at a safe distance. He would undoubtably see the fear. He would know in that instance, in that moment that I loved him. ""But he can't know?"" I thought to myself, my heart beating ever so quickly. I don't want to be hurt again. “Still looking down, I moved to take a step back, but he held on tighter. ""Look at me"" he whispered. I shook my head. It was my last attempt at guarding my heart. 

He gently placed  his hands under my chin and lifted my face upward. I was looking right into his eyes, searching hoping to find answers to questions, questions that at the moment were irrelevant. ""Can I kiss you?"" He asked. I knew if he kissed me things between us would never be the same. But I didn't care because in that moment as the rain fell around us, as I looked into his eyes the world became still and I felt no need to fight ""it"" any longer.I hesitantly nodded and slowly closed my eyes.

Her imperfection was her own perfection.
She is very socially awkward, I was the first guy to approach her and try to connect on a deeper level with.
This is/was new territory for her but she handled it well.
Like just today while we're talking in the halls, she asked me why I liked her. She could not believe I liked her. 
I said these halls aren't long enough for me to give the explanation you want.
So after school, we talked over text about that one thing for three hours.
She said to me ""Why to waste your time with me,"" ""I don't believe I am worth your time,"" ""I am most likely nothing you expect or want.""
I said to her, ""I expect nothing of you and want nothing of you but yourself.""
And I explained to her that I the reason why I felt strongly about her was that she was a real person.
She had problems but didn't hide them. 
In my eyes, she was beautiful, cute but herself took the ten to a two hundred.
Most of the people will mask it and conform to what is occurring around but not her.
Her imperfections were the perfection that finished her smile and made her laugh like a beautiful sound of nature.
Weird enough we both like Disney stuff.
From movies to tv shows we could talk about it forever.
I never told her that the quote from Good Luck Charlie is something I will always believe in.
Bob Duncan (the Dad) said to PJ (the son),
""Son, if you truly love something set free because if it comes back to you its meant to be.""
As creepy as this sounds, She might as well be the most influential person I've met.
And if I stood by that quote then, 
I hope to see you down the road and try this again someday.
Paths cross in more ways than one.
Who knows if we are meant to be or if we are not but time will only tell.
I don't think I'll have a problem letting go in the future, however,
as we walk down the halls even once a week in school, I don't think I'll let go just yet.

Never have I ever been interested in dating in High school until I met her.

She said NO. She said NO because she does not want to date in High School. I understood her perspective and said that&amp;#39;s fine. But we still talk as friends.

I hate you because I love you

We talk a lot and I say mean things

I'll just cut off your pair of wings

Just so my heart doesn’t bleed

I know I love you and I hate myself

You make my small heart sing

But you haven’t noticed a single thing

I look at you

And You look at me

You make me laugh and smile

And it’s totally worth my while

I don’t think that I regret it

Because our hearts beat together 

Do you like me too I wonder

And I’ll never know the answer

So I’ll settle with talking every day

As long as it’s with you, anyway

I hate you because I love you

We talk a lot and I say mean things

I'll just cut off your pair of wings

Just so my heart doesn’t bleed

1. When you win your heat in swimming (8 people) you get a rubber ducky.
2. We are all swimmers.
3. When you go into someone’s lane you have to stay with them for three hours (all of practice).
4. There are time intervals that you leave on in swimming, the leader of this lane is in charge of when to leave.

I’ve liked this girl for about 4 years and have been friend zoned, she’s a tan chinese girl who is about 5.9 ft, pretty face and good body, she’s really social being friends with almost everyone I know. We first met when i was 12, we both swim for the same swim team, when I first met her she was shy but very kind to me, we eventually became friends and nothing happened for like a month, until this guy asks her out (on a date) and she says yes I was watching it as this happened but did nothing, it was at this moment I got really jealous and mad, I never realized it but I guess I liked her. From then on it became a competition between me and Tyler, who could be the nicest to her who would talk the most to her, who’s lane she went in (it’s a swimmers thing) who could give the best presents. I started off by getting close to her friends, which was easy because I actually got along with them really well. Then I started coming in her and her friends lane and leading it, this became our close little group of friends I became labeled as the “gay guy” in the group of females. But hey... it worked. Her birthday comes around and I go totally overboard, I give her a cap, with Micheal Phelps, Ryan Lochte, Nathan Adrian, missy franklin and Ariana cougars, and a iTunes gift card, Tyler gives her a Mickey Mouse plush toy.  I get a text from her about how sweet I am you know whatever, nothing really happens for around another year besides me and her hanging out in the group together nothing really happening. Except for Valentine’s Day, Tyler got her nothing and she gave him a card, we have a swim meet on that weekend, so I win a total of 7 events in one day (one was against Tyler) so what I do is I get the 7 duckies which are all holding big hearts, and I carry them to her and our friends group and just dump them all on her lap. Informs of Tyler and his friends and just walk away. Fast forward to her next birthday, she’s been dropping hints to Tyler about how she wants some candles form this really really really expensive place, he gents her an mint mouse plush, and she’s like “wow... thank you!” But then I walk into practice with a big basket of her favorite candles and bath bombs and she drops the plush and takes the candles, she’s so happy, her days made my days made. (Throughout this entire time period she’s been coming in my lane we have been hanging out with friends and it’s been good) fast forward to January, I here from one of my guy friends that Tyler’s planning to breakup with her, what’s more is he has been cheating on her with Patrick’s (my close friend) girlfriend. I’m conflicted I want to tell her but I just can’t bring myself to do it. So I watch as slowly the rumors leak and he breaks up with her, she is completely fine, like even smiling a bit. But she also stops talking to me, she starts leaving my lane and responds to my texts a lot more rarely now. One month later she leaves my team completely, and from there we basically stop seeing each other. This all happened around March so we come to the summer and I see her at a Swim meet, she hunts she’s been cooking a lot, and I hint that she should come over sometime. She sends me a text later that says we should hangout during the summer it takes an entire month for us to get together at my house, alone. We decide to go paddle boarding on the lake talk about what’s happened since she left. We laugh fall into the water a couple times, she of coarse looks amazing in her one piece and braids. We decide to head back and dry off I let her change in my bed room, and then she says I can come in and change and then I make a joke about her to get out because I have to change and she says “ok, ha I wasn’t planning on staying” and then leaves with a smile on her face. I change and walk upstairs where she’s waiting on the coach, we decide to watch a movie together. We decide on the other women (she choose it)  and after we watch it we decide to make salmon, we cook it together and eat it, not Awful, it’s 9pm by this time and her mom calls to say she can’t find my house, so she decides to walk to the main road, I of coarse escort her and wait with her for her mom, I made a joke about something I can’t remember what, and my crush starts talking about how this old Chinese guy was hitting on her at her brothers wedding, and I of coarse respond with a omg what! That’s awful I’d never do that to you, and as a joke and a sort of I’ll defend you thing I asked what his name and where he lived she laughed and said it was fine and she didn’t know, her mom picks her up and leaves. The last and final meetings I’ve had with her was a week ago, when I asked her out and she responded with a ya! Lets invite Riley, a mutual friend of both of ours. I say ok because I want to hangout and I like Riley. Me and Riley make it there but Allison’s late, we get to talking and I find out that Allison had asked Riley to come because she felt super awkward with just me and her there, of coarse I’m really saddened by this because I thought our last hangout went great, but I just answer with a haha ya it would have been awkward, Allison finally arrived at the mall and we go get some food we are all talking happily but I can feel that Allison doesn’t really feel comfortable talking with me, and when she does it’s kind of a humiliating tone, mocking me, like when I would say I was going to look up a random persons insta Allison said “if you can spell their name” and other insults like that. At the end of our hangout I get a text from Allison, I open my phone and expect to see a “I had a great time” or maybe a “let’s do it again” but just to see her mock me for a comment I’d made earlier. We haven’t talked since then and I have no idea what to do, on one hand this girl has kept me up at night, I think about all we could be, how much I love her and that I’d take a bullet for her. On the other she seems not interested and never gives me much attention, and all she’s done lately is be mean. I really really love her, but I don’t know what to do, can you guys help me?

I am confident in my looks (I'd say a 6-7 easy(not to sound like a pompous fool)) and stand 6'2. Personality wise I am often quite good at making others laugh and seem to be the type people will confide in. However, I come from a particularly hairy family and sit uncomfortably under average in penis size at around the size of a toilet paper tube. The underwhelming nature of my member is a fact about myself that left me in a deeply depressed state for a while until realizing it's not the end all be all, though, it still haunts me and greatly robs me of any and all self-esteem.

It is needless to say I consume a lot of romance based media and porn with the singular constant being that smol peened men are nothing but jokes. One of my greatest fears in finding a woman I was interested in is that I would not be able to properly satisfy her the way another man could due to my condition. The only thing apparently worse than being ill equipped is inexperience as it seems you are expected to come in hitting home runs.

As a result of the aforementioned physical insecurities as well as the rapidly decreasing regard for men in society I have acquired a number of quirks.

I immediately assume the worse when women approach me despite logically knowing it couldnt possibly be so bad and will tense up as if I was staring down a bear. The few women I do regularly communicate with I realize I am only able to do so because they are either attached to other men or I simply view them as one of the guys.

The older I get with no experience at all with women has lead to the formation of complexes that can force me into what I could only describe as panic attacks. Ever since I was a teen I justified my own patheticness by saying that I would never  afflict myself on a woman as that would rob her of finding a better man. I might jokingly claim I am okay with becoming a wizard at 30 do to my virginity, but the reality couldnt be further from that. 

From what I can tell my window of opportunity is closing rapidly as no sane woman, from what I understand, could ever possibly want a shrimp-dicked terrified virgin as a mate the stigmas of which I feel get worse by the day.

I am okay with sharing any other information within reason, i am just looking for any advice to break the terrible mental walls i have formed and to possibly gain some light at the end of the tunnel if possible..

Earlier in the relationship, when we didn't live together, I had more time to come up (and execute) ideas. We got married, have toddlers running around the house, and I work semi-full time.

Between furthering my skills for work, being a decent father, and fixing up an old property we took on together, I feel a bit strained to do it all. Any time I have for me is between 11pm and 2am, and then if I wake up with the kids, I have no energy.

My wife oft complains that I am unromantic, that she wants to feel good. I feel like anything I do nice (whether it is take over a few chores, do nice things like light candles or give complements) is always met with a semi-sarcastic ""thaaaaanksss."" It feels like my effort was wasted and I often feel stupid for doing so. I've mentioned this before and she says that I'm stupid for thinking she doesn't like romantic things, she also tells me they don't have to be expensive (I mean, we do a -lot- together, we travel often with the kids and so on).

We do not live close to family or friends, so it is near impossible to find somebody to take the kids even for a brief amount of time, and even when we do, we simply rehash the lack of passion or romance or other ""outlier deliverable"" in our marriage, be it chores, who we think each other has a ""crush"" on, etc. It's like prime time to settle the score instead of enjoy each other's company.

Since she also called me out on not being romantic, it makes me not want to be romantic because then she'll assume I'm just doing a kneejerk and not actually being romantic or giving it thought. She is incredibly thoughtful, and is a fantastic mother, and I want to make her happy and feel good. Because of this, I'm hoping some people have ideas that do not cost much money (her request) that we can do with almost no time. It seems like the creative/functional inputs are limiting the ""romance product"" here.

I've wrote songs, made ""mix tape"" CDs, all of the high school stuff, we're a bit older now (mid 30's) and I'm trying to find better ways of connecting. TIA for reading all of this.

I hate to compare, but throughout the 10 months I’ve been with my bf he has only given me flowers and surprised me a handful of times. Once on my bday, when I graduated, and only once this time I told him to pick out a flower for me. I appreciate every time he does it for me and I even tell him how much it means to me and how I feel when he gets them for me. 


However, he hardly does it. I don’t know what to do. I’m tired of giving him hints of what he should do for me. He doesn’t understand that I don’t care about how the flower looks or if they’re from the dollar store, he just doesn’t get it. 

Im his first official girlfriend, the other 3 were just girls he was basically friends with benefits with. None of them were like me according to him, as in they didn’t expect the little cute stuff from him. I told him of course not. I’m different from them and he needs to learn to be more of what I like.

I always compliment him and tell him how lucky I am to have him.... but i feel like that isn’t enough for him to understand I need more of that. Our conversations through text are dry, when we’re out together he takes out his phone although I tell him how much it bothers me . 


I broke up with him once before in the beginning of our relationship because he wasn’t putting effort, and I feel like he’s doing the same now.

I'm a male introvert in my early twenties and I had a close best friend with benefits relationship with a guy in his mid thirties. We hung out together, watched shows together, slept in the same bed, etc. At the start of the relationship I had told him I wasn't looking to date anyone until I was a little older, and I don't date guys (just never had romantic feelings for guys). He is completely gay and developed romantic feelings toward me I explained to him I just didn't have the ability to reciprocate those feelings. We have known each other for about 2 years.

The problem is this...

I recently started dating again and I'm hanging out with a cute girl who I'm very likely to start a romantic relationship with. I recently brought her over to the house, I introduced her to him, etc. After dinner and drinks had settled down, we went off to the guest bedroom and he went off to the main bedroom. Needless to say, we were enjoying each-other's company in the guest room but it was blazing hot. I went over to the main room (which has full AC), and asked if we could barrow it for all of 30-40 minutes. (Before you think this is a little weird of a request, he constantly mentions the house we live in as our property, etc. So he thinks of it as our bedroom. And he also uses the room with other people for the same thing the girl and I would be doing.). I told him it was totally fine if he didn't feel comfortable with it... He agreed, got his stuff, and we all switched rooms... Fast forward about 30 minutes and we get dressed, and I go over to get him. He looks somewhat sad, so I tell him the room is clear and clean for him to go back over there. He replies with it's in use etc. I go back to the room, repeat 30 minutes later tried again... same response. No eye contact. Nothing. We decided to give him some space because he might be a little upset from the sudden request or maybe some third party thing.

Fast forward to this morning...

We slept in, woke up, chatted for a bit, then I went over to check on him and he was playing a game on his phone. I say hello and the usual, and he doesn't really respond. I sat down on the bed with him and asked him if he was feeling okay ... he just responded ""it doesn't matter""... I told him he can have the room... we were fine with him having it from the moment in the night before. He just said ""you still have someone over""... He never made eye contact. He just looked so sad. I may have feelings for him as a lover, but he is my best friend. I hate seeing him like this, but I have no idea how to help him. I don't want him to slip into a suicidal depression. I think he feels like I was his last real relationship and that I'm going to abandon him, despite all the things I've told him counter to that.

If anyone knows something or some approach, I would really appreciate the insight and help. He is an introverted gamer, who likes in general nerdy things, food, and anime. I just don't want to lose my best friend while trying to start the steps to having a family...

I am currently completing some research on romantic desirability, and I figured I may find some interested participants here. I would really appreciate if you could participate!

We are seeking English-speaking females, aged 18-45, who are attracted to males (whether you are heterosexual, bisexual, or other) to complete a brief (10-15 min) survey on romantic desirability.

Participation is completely voluntary and anonymous.Those who do complete the survey can enter the drawer to win 1 of 4 $50 (AUD) GiftPay or Amazon vouchers.

There is further information at the start of the survey, and links to some relevant papers in the final de-brief section.

Feel free to ask any questions in the comments, or to send me a DM. I hope this is an interesting topic and relevant to the sub :)

I wish I could have made you happy. 

I remember one of the first times we ever hung out together, we decided we were going to be running buddies. That didn't last but we had a conversation about how the men in your life tend to become addicted to you and then attached in an embarrassingly clingy way. Fast forward and...

We slept together a handful of times between my loft and my bull St house and I tried unbelievably hard to not show how I felt. I refused to fall for you because I didn't think it would end well and couldn't deal with losing any part of you. As a friend you are creative, spontaneous, adventurous and bold. As a lover you are as graceful as anything I could imagine, like a swan in the moonlight. My absolute definition of beautiful. 

Years ago, when you came to see me in New York, we went out with a friend of mine. I went to get drinks and when I came back you were in the bathroom. I sat down and he said ""my God she loves you!..."". No matter how many times I asked, Liam refused to ever tell me what he meant by it. The only thing he would tell me is that it had to do with something you said. Maybe he lied I don't know. However, immediately I remembered what you told me when we were jogging and became scared that I would lose you. 

Funny thing is that I fell for you back during our brief attempt at the running lifestyle. Unfortunately, I wouldn't let myself say anything because I was afraid you would run away thinking that I was just another one of the guys that caught feelings and was obsessed. 

Our time together in DC was an immense amount of fun however, I felt a significant amount of sadness coming off of you and it killed me that I couldn't make you happy. Holly, you are still every bit the graceful swan that I remember and grew to love in all aspects (mind, body and soul). 

I love you!
I wish that at some point we ever found a groove because you are perfect and I hope that one day someone makes feel as perfect as you are. 


You probably won't respond and that's ok. Most of the time when this much information comes in all at once it's rather overwhelming. But like I said, this had taken me a rather long time to word correctly and have the courage to even put into words. So, do with it what you will.

Tldr is she into me or do Greek women just behave this way.

Are greek woman naturally more touchy feely? A work colleague seems very comfortable with being close to me and often puts her hand on mine when talking, sometimes even my leg. She has not always been like this but i could put it down to her being more comfortable with me as we have become more freindly. I have not noticed her like this with anyone else.
  Desperately don't want to read it wrong and make fool of myself!  There are other things she has done that make me thinks maybe its more than just being friendly.

Thoughts?

&lt;p&gt;Tldr is she into me or do Greek women just behave this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are greek woman naturally more touchy feely? A work colleague seems very comfortable with being close to me and often puts her hand on mine when talking, sometimes even my leg. She has not always been like this but i could put it down to her being more comfortable with me as we have become more freindly. I have not noticed her like this with anyone else.
  Desperately don&amp;#39;t want to read it wrong and make fool of myself!  There are other things she has done that make me thinks maybe its more than just being friendly. Catch her looking and smiling at me a lot, she brings in food she has made at home to share with me at lunch. And it seems like she puts herself forward to work with me on a lot of projects. &lt;/p&gt;

It started off entirely innocent. Years ago, she had an apartment next to the college I had just enrolled to and needed a roommate so it seemed perfect. A lot happened. My girlfriend at the time left me for someone else, so I was, extremely depressed. Time went by. She graduated.I flunked out.

Love is fluid, we both take things as they come. She’s beautiful. Even objectively, she’s attractive to a large majority. I’m ok. I might be hard on myself, and I definitely look unique, dark skinned with hazel eyes.  But she’s gorgeous, the most beautiful person I’ve ever seen. Mixed with green eyes that will melt your soul. We’re living together again and she’s doing fantastic. She just became a teacher. I’m not doing so great. Recently I think I’ve accepted that I’m in love with her. It hit me like a brick shithouse, and here I am, entirely unsure of what to do. I want to tell her I love her. And I do, unconditionally. I don’t need her to be with me, as long as she’s in my life I’ll be ok. I’m strong, strong enough to truly love her, even when it hurts. But I won’t forgive myself if I never try. I’m not afraid of rejection, I expect it to some degree, but im simply not good enough for her. Not yet. She’s...amazing. I want to be too for both of us, and I believe I will be. She’s the sort of person that drives one to greatness so I’m optimistic of the future...at least in that regard. I’ve decided to tell her exactly how I feel. That I’m more than a best friend.  That I someone to consider. Someone she can love. But I’m terrified. I’m strong enough to lose her, but I’ll do anything to keep her, even as a friend. Even as her lowest friend I will endure for her. I must tell her. I won’t betray my feelings even if it brings great suffering. But even so I don’t know how to tell her. I don’t want to lose her as a friend for both of our sakes. We do love each other and we do need each other just not exclusively in “that” way. Ultimately I’m going to tell her. It would be up a betrayal of my own soul not to. But it never hurts to seek the guidance of others. So please, I am entirely open to your beliefs, opinions, and experiences. Maybe it will help, bit it absolutely will not hurt. So please let me know what you think. I have no set date to tell her but I feel like I must soon. I can’t Contain this for so much longer. For better or worse I must be entirely honest if not for her but myself. In the meantime there is great wisdom in the world and I wish to hear whatever I can. Thank you in advance. Made great fortune bless us all. 

Update: 

          I told her. I haven’t been home for work recently and I won’t be back again until this Thursday, but I had one day where I had time to come back home to see her. I figured not seeing each other for a few days afterwards would give us a lot of time to process everything. Anyway we hung out like always but started talking a little more seriously. She’s been thinking and in three years she wants to move out out NYC. We’ve talked about leaving for a while and I’m all for it, but I need to get myself together first, and so I was considering moving next year to finish school. I have some family I’ve recently reconnected with and so I think it would be my best chance of finishing. She was understandably upset. She wants to be with me for as long as possible but knows I need to achieve the things that are important to me. Long term it’s for the best, the more established I am, the more likely I’ll be able to be with her where ever she goes. We told each other how much we love each other and then I left, thinking that it wasn’t a good time to bring this up as well. On my way to the train station she texted me a few times how much she loves me and how important I am to her. I couldn’t wait anymore, I thought this would be as good of a time as any so I can back to talk to her. I explained as much as I could. How I had been feeling lately, why I might have been acting a little bit off, and then I told I loved her, that I was in love her. And, well, she sort of already knew. In hindsight it may have been fairly obvious, I’m not the best at hiding my feelings. We talked about where we were in life, where I was, how  I can be a little hard on myself. We talked a lot about each other but not as much about “us” as I’d hoped. She asked me if I wanted to date her and I said no not now. Which is true, I don’t right now, but eventually yes. I do love her, platonically, and romantically. We agreed that if it’s meant to be it will happen. I told her this doesn’t need to change anything, that I have no expectations of her reciprocating any of these feelings. I should’ve ended here but I felt like I had to do something for her to take me seriously, something to break the boundary of what we already had. So I kissed her...and I really shouldn’t have. I was selfish. I had time to think about this, I knew this was a boundary I wanted to cross. This was all just thrown at her, she didn’t have time to process this all and it just confused her. She’s crossed this boundary with other friends before and something worse has always followed. She said she doesn’t like when things are foggy, that it couldn’t happen again. We talked a little more and told each other how much we love each other and I left. I don’t regret telling her, I don’t even regret kissing her. It honestly played out more or less how I thought it would and I thought I would feel better afterwards, for accepting my feeling, for being entirely honest...but I feel horrible. It feels like a breakup, it feels like I’m in love with someone that can’t love me back. It feels like like my hearts broken, again. I’m glad it will be a few days before I see her again, I need to process and grieve. I do love her unconditionally, I will be with her for the rest of my life regardless of what our relationship is. But fuck, I’m going to suffer, at least for a while. Watching her be with other people, trying to fall in love with someone else, trying to maintain our relationship while looking her in the eye without showing her how much I still love and want her... it’s going to be hell. But I’ve been through this once, I can do it again. I’m staying focused. I’m exercising regularly, I’m staying healthy, I’m getting a better job, I’m writing, I’m pursuing my passions, I’m living. But I don’t know what to do next. Do I pretend this never happened just get through this until it doesn’t hurt as badly? Do I hold on to hope? Do I go on believing that if I achieve all I want and show her I can be a lover, that she’ll see me this way?Do I leave, something I could do so easily even though I promised her I never would? Or do I simply try not to love her that way anymore, is that even possible, to purposely fall out of love with someone. I’m just hurt, I’m confused, and it feels like there’s no real solution to this. It feels like no matter what I’m loosing some part of her and some part of myself. I appreciate all of the support everyone has given me through this. Please share your thoughts, tell me your stories, your wisdom and guidance inspire me. Thank you.

Will light up the entire place with artificial battery operated candles. I am planning a small table with a flower pot near the canopy and a couple of wine glasses.

Will have some light music and I am right now working on my proposal speech. Will take pictures of the thing and share if feasible.

I don't really crush on people because they all feel the same to me nowadays (and can't keep their fucking eyes off their phones for a second). I did attempt to come out of my shell and become friends with him and we joked around in class and he was always very encouraging nice and always reminded me to speak up.

I found out a lot about him including his real first name (he gave me the name he prefers to be called be he doesn't like his own), where he's from, and I played along with all of his strange antics and jokes. I had meant to ask him for his number, but shied away from doing so.  About a week after that encounter, he stopped talking to me, moved seats and purposefully avoided me at all times. I had no clue what I had done wrong and I managed to stop and ask him once and he said that I began distracting him and I was a bit too fun during class. I said okay, thinking we were on good terms, but when went back to avoidance and all again. I even bought food in because I missed a party and he refused to eat any of it. I have no idea what in the world I could've done wrong. So we pretty much ended off on silent and bad terms. During the last month of the class, I began trying to find information on him, but I only had his first name to go off. About 4 weeks into my searching I ended up finding his full name, phone number (which I later found out was the house's landline), his address, his family members' names, who he lives with, his father's business, and his facebook profile that he doesn't really check. 3 weeks ago, I found out where he went at the end of his summer job last year and figured he would be there this year again (carnival)(found out today that he's working the same one). I would like to go to the duration of the carnival and wait out for him.  It's pretty much the only chance I have left at getting to know him. I was wondering if i should do it or not. Please let me know your opinion.

I'm 19.
My perfect guy would wear 1920s vintage round fully circular glasses (I think they're called Wilhelms.

When I say that he&amp;#39;s the man of my dreams, he&amp;#39;s absolutely perfect (read below what my definition of that ). He graduated this year and I&amp;#39;m got extremely upset at myself for not getting to know him better after the year ended.  I&amp;#39;ve been through an extreme amount of things in life and oddly enough, not trying harder to be friends with him is my biggest regret. I&amp;#39;ve never met someone like him.

I was uncomfortable at the notion that another person could make me feel this way, but what caught me most off-guard was the fact that nothing particularly romantic was happening at the time. In fact, we were simply exchanging the most unflattering pictures we could take of ourselves while going about our separate lives. The time and place didn't seem appropriate for such a realization, yet the feeling persisted.

I allowed myself to dive deeper into this thought process as the rest of my 12 hour night shift droned on. She, in fact, had been the one encouraging me to become more in-touch with myself. 

Being on opposite schedules limited our opportunity for interactions, and being 120 miles from each other offered a unique perspective. Was I romanticizing the bond?

      5th grade- I wasn’t a cute kid. Not ugly per say, but ordinary. I remember the twenty minute walk home from the train, with my face in a book. My little brothers bickered ahead of me. I drove through stinging nettle patches on my bike with my them. We climbed trees... you get it. Late bloomer. I didn’t notice that I wasn’t unnoticed, and therefore I was unaware. Ignorance is bliss right? Maybe in this case, perhaps not. 
I had always little crushes on guys for as long as I can remember. I was sheltered, and naive, however. Nothing came of anything...

      That is until the new guy came to my little private school. Not just any dude. Imagine a non sociopathic version of Zack Morris from Saved By the Bell. Even better- imagine Leo from Titanic, minus the whole dying thing. Just the first tape...He was dreamy. He was witty, charismatic, best of all, a wonderful artist. He was a cool middle school kid, as I was just a 5th grader. He was in 7th grade. He had dirty blonde hair, blue eyes and a brilliant smile. He was Julian. I’d sneak through his files in art class. My hands would shake, and I’d stare in awe at his work. He was perfect. 

      I noticed that after school, he didn’t typically take the underground like everyone else had. He walked another way, and would then disappear. I had to find out where he was going. It was my little twelve year old dream that he would walk with me there, to the train, (or his secret place) and hold my hand. I hatched a plan. My then only real friend outside of school was recruited to stalk this kid with me, along with my youngest brother. It’s oddly easy to follow someone in a city. It is smarter to do so when familiar with the area. 

      He, and his friends turned a corner, as we followed from a distance. Naturally, my heart pounded. We giggled and speculated all the secret things he could’ve been doing. There was a brick arch way that turned into a small flowery court yard. I peered around it, and saw him smoking a cigarette... ‘There’s his little secret,’ I thought. My naive brain was rattled. Not that he smoked, but that his older brother noticed me. The whole group, including Julian, saw me. There was no point in hiding, and no way of being able to casually pass through the court yard. It was a dead end. 

      “Hey Nicole,” he said, slightly confused. Still friendly, and so charming. 

Nicole Autopilot:

      “Hey Julian... you know, it’s crazy- my brother ran away...and I was just looking for him.”  The embarrassment radiated through me- like it had been injected directly through my veins.

      “Isn’t that your brother right there?” Julian nodded knowingly towards him- My brother stared blankly... 

“Yes, yes...that’s him, I’ve found him.” 

      I wrote all about the hilarity, and humiliation in my diary that night. My head spun. ‘Now he knows I like him-so screwed.’ 





Part 2 - One year goes by- 

      Sixth grade rolled around, and I couldn’t wait to see him again. I even pondered about him in my diary that hot, un-air-conditioned summer. When school started, I walked by him, standing coolly with his friends. Our eyes locked, it hurt to look at him. I walked on- he watched me pass by. I could hardly feel my legs carry me.

Nicole autopilot. 

      During school enrollment period, was the first time I ever saw him. I remember how he walked, I couldn’t believe this gorgeous Austrian boy I had witnessed. I couldn’t look back up at him. It seared my blown eye sockets when his eyes met mine. I could smell him as he breezed by. My ears went hot. I outed the idea of him quickly. The school was small. ‘Every girl will be all over him,’ I thought. I just knew there would be no way. I was very right. Girls would gush about him, not only at school, but to my own 13th birthday party. I went with a lot of girls from school to paddle boat on the Danube river. They wouldn’t have spoken to me, had there not been an occasion to do something. Plus, I was allowed out of the house. Teen goals... 

      We laughed on the water. Topic Julian came up, and I froze. It was another American girl much more developed, and less naive than I. Molly, along with several others admitted to liking him. They spoke of all their magical encounters with him. I sat there paralyzed. In the autumn Austrian sun, I played it off until the fan-girling fest was over. I cringed every time his name came up, unless it was one of the hundred times I’d written about him in my diary. I didn’t know how to take this infatuation of mine. 


      This year was different. I started wearing lipstick and mascara. My body changed from lanky to shapely/slender. In my mind, I was still just a kid, but hormones were kicking in quickly. Boys called out to me in the city. Love notes, and poems came my way. Still a total nervous, dorky mess in my mind. The attention took me by surprise.

      I remember the first time Julian spoke to me. He made me laugh, but so insanely nervous. ‘Surely, he’s fucking with me,’ I thought. I started seeing him more, and I would look forward to passing him in the hall after art class. “Hey Nicole!” He said. Being the stubborn ass that I was, I walked on. He was never short of female attention, why me? 

      My International private school separated boys and girls physical ed. Our school didn’t have a gymnasium. The rented fields were a good 15 Minute walk away. This was a rare time in which we weren’t supervised. The walks to and from the field was everyone’s fun time to talk about whatever we wanted. I should say whatever ‘they’ wanted, because sometimes, I’d walk with my one friend. I commonly walked alone. 

      Julian caught up to me from these walks. We would talk about where we were from, and whatever else. It shook me completely. He was 2 years older than myself, and clearly less naive. He would slide his finger over the back of my bra. Putting on my act, mixed with being paralyzed, 

Autopilot 

      I rolled my eyes. I couldn’t believe he was paying attention to me. He was a funny guy, and I was still awkward and weird. I still had to show him I wasn’t like the rest of his fan club. I secretly savored every bit of his attention. He was just so cool. Too cool for me. Not just conventionally cool. Savvy, confident, and ingenious. Our last phys-ed walk that I remember, he held my hand. It was a truly beautiful walk. Just like a movie, my dream came true. He held my trembling hand. I worried he’d noticed. My life long bully followed behind, hitting me in the ankles with a hockey stick. I didn’t feel it. Julian held my hand. 

      I still never let on. I basically secretly played our interactions in my head over, and over. I fantasized about him in any way that my pre pubescent mind could. He gave me a reason not to hate school. I had few friends, and didn’t do well in general. 

      He was so smooth. It was time for phys ed, and I headed down the large, old stair case towards the exit. I smelled him behind me. Only God in Heaven knows what scent he wore, because I swear, that’s where it came from. Before I could fall down the stairs, (simply from the mini panic attack of his presence) I felt a light touch on my shoulder. From behind me, he moved his hands in a way from my neck down to my ankles, mimicking an hour glass, hardly touching me. Kid had moves... I continued down the stairs, clinging to the old railing for dear life.

      I once left my diary (full of his name) at his bus stop. In horror, I grabbed my little brother’s hand, jumped off the metro, and sprinted back. I cried, and just knew he’d find it. Somehow, I found it where I’d left it. There, in it’s floral pattern, it sat neatly on a wooden bench seemingly untouched. Interestingly, being at his bus stop was the only attempt I’d ever made to approach him. Not out of spite, but when I finally had the nerve- he was never there. 

      Toward the middle of the year, there was talk of certain Austrian students having to leave the private school. My heart sunk. It was true after all. It turned out to be a technicality of accreditation. Julian came to school less and less. I still didn’t have what it took to hide my grief. I rarely spotted him after school, but the last day he attended. I was on my usual way to the subway when he caught up with me. My friends walked ahead, the path was narrow. Before I could get the nerve to ask him if I’d ever see him again, I completely ruined it. 

      Julian slowly moved his body towards mine, as we were pressed against an old brick wall. I’ll never forget how close he was to me- I’d never been close to any man like that. My ears rung, and I was on fire. I remember the cold brick on my back, and his scent. Fire and ice surged throughout me. I looked down, and nervously laughed. When I looked up, he went to kiss me. To this day, I’ll never know why, but I slapped him. He immediately walked ahead with everyone else, and wouldn’t look at me. It was as though it’d all happened in less than a second. I didn’t know he was kissing me. I didn’t have the time to process what had just happened. Before I could apologize, his train came, and I never saw him again. Sort of...

      Some time later, perhaps a year or even more, my school held an event. He was long gone. Never from my mind, but it had been some time since his departure. I suppose we’d grown up a lot. I didn’t know he was there, until the event was over. The school gossip informed me that he was outside. Unsure why to this day, but my only reaction was ‘why.’ I couldn’t stop wondering why he attended, while I face checked myself before seeing him.  The cold Austrian chill jacked me in the face, as most days, and my hair flew back as I exited the building to ‘leave,’ (aka see him.) This would be my last chance, and I knew it. Then, there he was, cool as ever. He wasn’t animated though, I couldn’t say hello. His demeanor was different. It was defeated. Maybe perhaps even resentful. I’d slapped him after all. I don’t know why I’d assumed that he’d conveniently forget about the whole, slapping thing. I’ll always wonder why he’d looked solemn that night. I didn’t think it was because of me. I wondered a lot about everything, but specifically him. The first guy that ever noticed me. I remember so much, that I’ve become accustomed to people not remembering what I remember. It was charming. Sad, but charming. Just like the very last time I saw him. I’ve always felt in tune with other’s feelings. It took a lot of years to truly process what happened; to this day, I still wonder. I nonchalantly waved at a distance, as I made my way to the tram. He watched coldly as I disappeared from the corner to the tram. 

I was 16, school friend and I were flipping through Maxim mag on the subway. I stumbled across an Axe ad. 

 “This could be Julian,” I laughed at my horrid eyesight. Haley snatched my copy.

“That is Julian.” 

He is now a brilliant artist in his field. 





","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;When ignorance wasn’t bliss. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  5th grade- I wasn’t a cute kid. Not ugly per say, but ordinary. I remember the twenty minute walk home from the train, with my face in a book. My little brothers bickered ahead of me. I drove through stinging nettle patches on my bike with my them. We climbed trees... you get it. Late bloomer. I didn’t notice that I wasn’t unnoticed, and therefore I was unaware. Ignorance is bliss right? Maybe in this case, perhaps not. 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had always little crushes on guys for as long as I can remember. I was sheltered, and naive, however. Nothing came of anything...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  That is until the new guy came to my little private school. Not just any dude. Imagine a non sociopathic version of Zack Morris from Saved By the Bell. Even better- imagine Leo from Titanic, minus the whole dying thing. Just the first tape...He was dreamy. He was witty, charismatic, best of all, a wonderful artist. He was a cool middle school kid, as I was just a 5th grader. He was in 7th grade. He had dirty blonde hair, blue eyes and a brilliant smile. He was Julian. I’d sneak through his files in art class.

I’m usually not one for the heartbreak stuff and expressing my feelings especially when it makes me vulnerable but this girl she broke down that wall. I used to be the guy who didn’t believe in love anymore. I never was one to fall relatively easy as it was. Usually when things ended with a girl I moved on and didn’t look back and honestly didn’t care. I didn’t think that there was ‘the one’ or a soulmate. Because how could there be just one person who is meant for someone with all these people in the world? I’ve had my shares of heartbreak even as far as being engaged and it ending because of an affair. This one though, this one hit hard and hurt bad. 

It was one of those moments that you think back on and wonder how it even happened. One of those nights where you are working until almost 11pm on a Saturday night, all you want to do is go home shower and hit the bed. That was my typical Saturday night. I get a phone call from my best friend who moved out of state a while back so when we are in each others area we try to catch up. He happened to be down in my hometown for the weekend and told me to come out with him. I hesitated because I was exhausted and I know the nights him and I have when we are together…holy hell. None the less I meet up with him and he is with a (girl) friend of his and her two friends and there she was….

There she was standing there all 5 foot of her, deep brown eyes, hair a mess from a long day of partying but still cuter than any girl in that place. Standing in a corner in the back of the bar by the pool table. We were introduced, she commented on a tattoo of mine and that was that. As the group moved to the dance floor I think that’s when I actually got hooked. She started dancing and rapping to some song which now after knowing her she probably didn’t know half of the words but still nailed it, all eyes on her. It was exactly what I’ve been looking for in a partner. Someone who can have a great time and not care what others thought. We ended up going to the casino and I ended up back at her hotel. The next day I contacted her on social media and sent her my number…up until a couple weeks ago we talked every day and I couldn’t even tell you half the things we talked about. There were times I would have a Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Text message notifications within minutes of each other and vice versa. i can honestly say she was my everything for those 3 months and me meeting her was the best thing that happened to me. She made me fall. Fall hard and quick. 

I know it sounds absolutely crazy that in that short amount of time someone can feel the way i feel about you. All i can say to y'all is you haven't met her. And to the lucky ones who have gotten a chance, will get a chance and will get another chance to make her yours understand what you have. Not everyone is as lucky as us to come across someone like this. So appreciate her…everything about her and don’t let her go because you will regret it. 

Let her be the weird goofball that she is. She’s gonna wanna dance like theres no tomorrow or until she starts complaining about her feet hurting because she loves wearing cute heels and sexy shoes. “It’s hard being a girl.” There may be times when you are walking in the mall or outside and the music is playing, most likely she’s gonna have the urge to sing it or dance a little too it. NO matter who is watching or how many people are there…embrace it and join her. Be a goof with her. Be weird together. Remember she's choosing to be that way with you and because when you are with her it shouldn’t matter. Its just you and her and those random strangers watching you are just happen to be in the right place at the right time to witness a connection like that.

She sometimes likes to cause scenes in public…not the scenes you are thinking about. She’ll start arguing over something that is completely made up just to make you uncomfortable and others reactions but she’s completely joking. You can either look at her like she’s crazy, be embarssed and walk out or you can go along with it. Don't walk out. Admit that you are wrong in whatever she is yelling about or deny it, but keep going. Whatever story she comes up with to a stranger and includes you in it…go with it. She once told a stranger on our second date that we had a child together….our story went on for about 15 minutes. 15 minutes of not knowing what the other one was going to add to the story. We still laughed about weeks later. After you walk out you won’t be able to stop laughing about it. Thats who she is. For most people that could be too much but why? Life is to dull as it is we need someone who is always going to keep it fresh and fun. If you can’t handle a little embarrassment she’s not the one for you! She loves it. She can also take it too. 

She is like no\-one I’ve ever met before. In the time that we talked and saw each other I always wondered and often mentioned how I didn’t understand how nobody could want to be with her and how the ones who had a chance to be with her let her go. Her response was always either, i don’t know, they all end up hating me or they couldn’t handle me. So she wants to go out sometimes and close the bar down and dance till the lights come on. Sometimes she just wants to go out with coworkers or her girlfriends. She is a the type of girl who likes commitment and having someone every night but also is independent and needs her own time and space. Chances are shed rather spend the night with you watching a movie or show then going out and partying, but when she does want to go out you have to be okay with it and let her have her fun. She will be back. 

She’s the girl you want around your friends. They love her. It’ll get to a point to where they invite you out or to do something and they ask if she’s coming. You can wander off for a few minutes knowing that she is perfectly comfortable talking to your friends and carrying on a conversation without you up her ass and vice versa. She'll make fun of you along with them and even start some of it. In fact its almost like she’s known them for ever when she mingles with them. She cares about your friends and who they are. Honestly she is the first girl who before she met my friends, when i would talk about them she asked to see what they look like so she knows who I’m talking about when i talk about them. It may sound stupid but for me that shows that she actually does care about you and your friends.

She makes you feel like you can tell her anything and it feels so good when you do. She’ll be your best friend. She’ll be the first thing you think of when you wake up and the last thing you think of before you fall asleep and everything in between. This girl will drive you crazy. Make you feel like you never thought you could feel. When you lose her you will feel like there is nothing left…and just lost. Don’t lose her. Don’t give her away. Love her. Love her hard, every day. Love her for EVERYTHING that she is. The cute. The Sexy. The beautiful. The Funny. When she’s not funny but thinks she is. The brains. The rude jokes. The insults. The compliments. The weirdness. Her obsession with documentaries. The obnoxiousness. The independence. With make up. Without makeup. The good and the bad. 

Appreciate everything about her. She needs someone who she can be herself around. Let it all out. So when she wants to crank the radio up and sing to a song she knows all the words to or only the chorus, don’t turn it down. Turn it up louder and sing with her if you know the words and if you don’t make em up she does half the time anyways. Like i said..dance with her in random public places to that song, be obnoxious with her, have fun with her make her feel that weird is normal. Show people that she is yours, you are that lucky son of a bitch that gets to be weird with her. People will look at you and be jealous of what YOU have, not what she has, but you. She is incredible. Amazing and deep down inside has a heart of gold. She will make you wanna drop everything just to be with her. Drive hours just to spend the night with her because with her its right and she makes you feel complete. You will never live life the same after you meet her, without her it will always be incomplete. She will make you fall in love with her and if she doesn’t then you don’t deserve her. 

That girl…..she was my soulmate. She was the one. But now she’s gone. And she’s gone before we had a chance. Our situation wasn’t ideal, we lived 2 hours away from each other and she’s the type of personality that needs someone every night so that worked against me and although i tried it just wasn’t enough. Thats why this one hit hard and hurt the worst. It’s the fact that a connection that her and I had didn’t mature and grow because of distance. It kills me every day knowing that we could have had a happy life together and we didn’t get the chance to see it. We can cling to that ol saying that ‘if its meant to be then we will end up together’ but the only problem with that is it could be too late. And that right now is my biggest fear. Its not losing her because that is done. Its her realizing what we had and it being too late to make it work. To the lucky ones after me, appreciate her and love her for who she is. She’s worth all the awkward moments in public. Theres no other way to put it other than that she’s pretty fucking great. Like i said when she’s gone you will regret it so don’t let her go. Do everything you can to keep her. I promise you won’t be disappointed.

I don't care if we only had known each other for a few months, what we felt was real. I thought it'd lead to something.. something more than that awkward in between stage of not being together, but not being just friends or just a hookup either. You can be with a person for 3 years and feel nothing….you can be with a person for 3 months and feel everything. Every time my phone goes off I just pray it's you and my heart sinks every time it's not. I realize that to this day I would still do anything for you. I would have dropped anything and everything on the spot for you, and if I had a .0001 percent chance of being able to have you I would have left my life for that. I'm an idiot for saying all this and I most likely scared you off. I'm not crazy but I may be a little crazy for you. Its’s only been a few weeks and it feels so much longer than that and it feels weird to know that you’re somewhere out there and despite all the different ways we used to communicate it like there’s an invisible force between us preventing us to do that. It sucks. It’s just weird because everything seems just like a distant memory and you’re just a stranger again after just weeks of this. I can’t even begin to think what my life is gonna be like without yo in it still to this day. At the end of the day I’m just glad I even had the opportunity to ever have met you. If a soul mate was real, you would probably be the one. I’ll always remember you (unless I get Dementia or Alzheimer’s). 

\*\*\*Two months with little to no communication and we ended up together. She moved from her home state to mine and we are currently living a pretty happy life in our own apartment. Sometime's love takes time and space for you to realize certain things....don't ever give up or change who you are. The right one will come along...you just have to be patient. 

OneLoveYall,

\_5L1M","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I find myself feeling lost in these long uneventful days without her, I still can’t seem to stop thinking of how lucky I was to spend the short amount of time I was able too with her. I’m usually not one for the heartbreak stuff and expressing my feelings especially when it makes me vulnerable but this girl she broke down that wall. I used to be the guy who didn’t believe in love anymore. I never was one to fall relatively easy as it was. Usually when things ended with a girl I moved on and didn’t look back and honestly didn’t care. I didn’t think that there was ‘the one’ or a soulmate. Because how could there be just one person who is meant for someone with all these people in the world? I’ve had my shares of heartbreak even as far as being engaged and it ending because of an affair. This one though, this one hit hard and hurt bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was one of those moments that you think back on and wonder how it even happened. One of those nights where you are working until almost 11pm on a Saturday night, all you want to do is go home shower and hit the bed. That was my typical Saturday night. I get a phone call from my best friend who moved out of state a while back so when we are in each others area we try to catch up. He happened to be down in my hometown for the weekend and told me to come out with him. I hesitated because I was exhausted and I know the nights him and I have when we are together…holy hell. None the less I meet up with him and he is with a (girl) friend of his and her two friends and there she was….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There she was standing there all 5 foot of her, deep brown eyes, hair a mess from a long day of partying but still cuter than any girl in that place. Standing in a corner in the back of the bar by the pool table. We were introduced, she commented on a tattoo of mine and that was that. As the group moved to the dance floor I think that’s when I actually got hooked. She started dancing and rapping to some song which now after knowing her she probably didn’t know half of the words but still nailed it, all eyes on her. It was exactly what I’ve been looking for in a partner. Someone who can have a great time and not care what others thought. We ended up going to the casino and I ended up back at her hotel. The next day I contacted her on social media and sent her my number…up until a couple weeks ago we talked every day and I couldn’t even tell you half the things we talked about. There were times I would have a Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Text message notifications within minutes of each other and vice versa. i can honestly say she was my everything for those 3 months and me meeting her was the best thing that happened to me. She made me fall. Fall hard and quick. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it sounds absolutely crazy that in that short amount of time someone can feel the way i feel about you. All i can say to y&amp;#39;all is you haven&amp;#39;t met her. And to the lucky ones who have gotten a chance, will get a chance and will get another chance to make her yours understand what you have. Not everyone is as lucky as us to come across someone like this. So appreciate her…everything about her and don’t let her go because you will regret it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let her be the weird goofball that she is. She’s gonna wanna dance like theres no tomorrow or until she starts complaining about her feet hurting because she loves wearing cute heels and sexy shoes. “It’s hard being a girl.” There may be times when you are walking in the mall or outside and the music is playing, most likely she’s gonna have the urge to sing it or dance a little too it. NO matter who is watching or how many people are there…embrace it and join her. Be a goof with her. Be weird together. Remember she&amp;#39;s choosing to be that way with you and because when you are with her it shouldn’t matter. Its just you and her and those random strangers watching you are just happen to be in the right place at the right time to witness a connection like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She sometimes likes to cause scenes in public…not the scenes you are thinking about. She’ll start arguing over something that is completely made up just to make you uncomfortable and others reactions but she’s completely joking. You can either look at her like she’s crazy, be embarssed and walk out or you can go along with it. Don&amp;#39;t walk out. Admit that you are wrong in whatever she is yelling about or deny it, but keep going. Whatever story she comes up with to a stranger and includes you in it…go with it. She once told a stranger on our second date that we had a child together….our story went on for about 15 minutes. 15 minutes of not knowing what the other one was going to add to the story. We still laughed about weeks later. After you walk out you won’t be able to stop laughing about it. Thats who she is. For most people that could be too much but why? Life is to dull as it is we need someone who is always going to keep it fresh and fun. If you can’t handle a little embarrassment she’s not the one for you! She loves it. She can also take it too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is like no-one I’ve ever met before. In the time that we talked and saw each other I always wondered and often mentioned how I didn’t understand how nobody could want to be with her and how the ones who had a chance to be with her let her go. Her response was always either, i don’t know, they all end up hating me or they couldn’t handle me. So she wants to go out sometimes and close the bar down and dance till the lights come on. Sometimes she just wants to go out with coworkers or her girlfriends. She is a the type of girl who likes commitment and having someone every night but also is independent and needs her own time and space. Chances are shed rather spend the night with you watching a movie or show then going out and partying, but when she does want to go out you have to be okay with it and let her have her fun. She will be back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s the girl you want around your friends. They love her. It’ll get to a point to where they invite you out or to do something and they ask if she’s coming. You can wander off for a few minutes knowing that she is perfectly comfortable talking to your friends and carrying on a conversation without you up her ass and vice versa. She&amp;#39;ll make fun of you along with them and even start some of it. In fact its almost like she’s known them for ever when she mingles with them. She cares about your friends and who they are. Honestly she is the first girl who before she met my friends, when i would talk about them she asked to see what they look like so she knows who I’m talking about when i talk about them. It may sound stupid but for me that shows that she actually does care about you and your friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She makes you feel like you can tell her anything and it feels so good when you do. She’ll be your best friend. She’ll be the first thing you think of when you wake up and the last thing you think of before you fall asleep and everything in between. This girl will drive you crazy. Make you feel like you never thought you could feel. When you lose her you will feel like there is nothing left…and just lost. Don’t lose her. Don’t give her away. Love her. Love her hard, every day. Love her for EVERYTHING that she is. The cute. The Sexy. The beautiful. The Funny. When she’s not funny but thinks she is. The brains. The rude jokes. The insults. The compliments. The weirdness. Her obsession with documentaries. The obnoxiousness. The independence. With make up. Without makeup. The good and the bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appreciate everything about her. She needs someone who she can be herself around. Let it all out. So when she wants to crank the radio up and sing to a song she knows all the words to or only the chorus, don’t turn it down. Turn it up louder and sing with her if you know the words and if you don’t make em up she does half the time anyways. Like i said..dance with her in random public places to that song, be obnoxious with her, have fun with her make her feel that weird is normal. Show people that she is yours, you are that lucky son of a bitch that gets to be weird with her. People will look at you and be jealous of what YOU have, not what she has, but you. She is incredible. Amazing and deep down inside has a heart of gold. She will make you wanna drop everything just to be with her. Drive hours just to spend the night with her because with her its right and she makes you feel complete. You will never live life the same after you meet her, without her it will always be incomplete. She will make you fall in love with her and if she doesn’t then you don’t deserve her. &lt;/p&gt;

This starts in the beginning of year 12, but little did I know I knew this from before year 12 like around year 8 year 9. This boy I saw when me and my friends where in a shopping centre stood out to me. I don't know if it was because he was asian (fyi I have a thing for asian boys, like kpop asian). But I genuinely felt my heart shrivel, I knew he had a bad hair cut and ge looked beautiful at the same time. I guess he had a trending haircut, but let's move on. I saw this boy and his name is (for the sake of the story) Bamon. 

Ok. Here is how it goes. I like this Bamon, because he looks good and mostly because he was different to all the other boys, he genuinely expressed himself if he had to. In the beginning of the school year he was in my English class and I would constantly wear make up (I've never done that) and do my hair nice, sit in the front of the class room and any chance I get I indulge in looking at his face once in a while, so I had a MEGA crush on this boy. Honestly I was meant to keep it a secret and not tell anyone til the end of year 13 because I wasn't one of those people who wanted to splay the fact I liked a boy, especially because I am (believe it or not) ugly. To be honest people found out that I liked him and the loudest person in my year group (a friend but she's still loud) went around the common room shouting that I liked Bamon (I think his gf must have heard it). 

So year 12 finished and I never once talked to him and even if I had wanted to I wouldn't because I was so nervous words wouldn't come out I would blush, sweat and make bad jokes. Beforw you think there's a chance, he was going out with a girl called (for the sake of the story) Penny. Year 13 came and I summoned the corouge during summer before the start of Year 13 to talk to this boy, well just sort of pop up to him on social media. And gradually we started talking. At this time I knew his relationship with his girlfirend was rocky because my friends would tell me, and I thought this was my chance to talk to him up and personal (after a while he broke up and got back together with this girl). We got so close we talked to each other about depression and etc. He would tell me how much he loves Penny and how he would get jealous if anyone touches her and this would obviously hurt me a little because all this while, all they ever do is fight or have conflicts. We became sort of friends through this, and he did say some dodgy stuff along the way during this friendship. 

I knew he didn't like me because he wouldn't be the first to approach and obviously knowing that I would distance myself accordingly, also he deleted his profile on the social media we talked on and it was huge conversation. I didn't even have the chance to reply to him. I felt that was a huge sign. 

But every now and then I always wish I could have a glow up and somehow he would like me more than his girlfirend Penny, even though I know that they are happily going out, I want him to somehow turn his attention to me. I would probably do everythig he asks me to do. All I ever do is snoop around his private life, only because I want to help him out and by doing that he would realise that he might like me (but this is impossible because he's a loyal boyfriend). Today I donated £10 to his go fund me charity, because it's something close to his heart. I don't even know. I wrote a message on the go fund me that might make him recognise who wrote it. But I know he doesn't care that much, because he probably won't even recognise my personality. He's always surrounded by beautiful girls and so many friends, despite him saying that he doesn't have any friends. I don't know if he would or not. I just want him to notice me. Even as a close friend would be fine. But he probably won't try to acknowledge me as anyone special because he has a girlfriend. 

I know I should stop but somehow I can't. I liked him even before I knew he had a girlfriend.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Context: England&lt;/p&gt;

I love people. All the time, every day, every message, every call, every talk online in voice rooms and group chats. I love all my family. My friends. My closest of companions. 

But none of them are for me to love... without holding back. 

There are few who have touched my inner self. Caught a glimpse of the rarest creature they could have ever encountered - the truest me I could ever know. 

She grew up in a house. A dirty one. A smelly one. A loud one. A broken one. Roaches crawled into her bed every so often. Food laid around, wasting, for days sometimes. Items spewn about the ground, some intact, some broken, some dirty, some clean, some so beyond their original state is was a wonder if you could tell its prior purpose. Some were Mom's. Some were Dad's. Some were hers. But none of it was really hers, she thought. No toy was really hers, no game, no device, not her bed, not her clothes, not her fish in the tank next to her bed, not even her bed. Not the room where she was relecated. Not the home she grew up in. All of it could be taken in an instant. Because she said something wrong. Did the thing the wrong way. Missed a question on the test and didn't get it right all the way. Forgot Mom was sleeping. Bothered Dad too much after work. 

The house was always smelling bad in some way. Rotton things, putrid things, smell of cat and dog and human and plant. musky, humid, horrid. 

The house was always loud. Very loud. Machines not working right. Cars with loud engines. Loud grass cutters. Loud Mom. Loud Dad. Very Loud Mom. Screaming Mom. Yelling Dad. What did they yell about? Why couldn't they be quiet? Did they not like each other? Did they not like her? They talked about her, yelled about her, a lot. Food? Money? House? Bills? Her. Her. Always her. 

Was it her fault? She reasoned, maybe. If she wasn't there, there wouldn't be as many bills. There wouldn't be as many arguments about money for food or for that thing called ""rent"". Maybe they could be happier without each other, someone else maybe? No, they had to stay together ""for her"". For each other? For her. Always for her. Why though? They were always mad at each other. Mom would Scream at Dad a lot. Scream so loudly and so hard that she'd lose her voice, break and turn purple in the face and spit would fly and her eyes would go wide. 

After all that, The Real Me wished for something she wasn't getting from her parents. But what?

After going through Elementary and Middle School, passing grades with ease and making some friends here and there that came and went, little did she expect anyone to show her some attention past what her school mates and teachers showed her. 

Then came The First. 

He was tall, a head higher than she was. A full head of hair that fell softly to his shoulders, a wide jawline and a smile that stretched across the globe, with teeth as pearly white as they could be naturally. A chest and arms that could pick up anything he wanted. Legs that carried him for days and leagues with every confident step in his military-influenced stride. His charm was as clear as his cream colored skin. 
Something awoke in The Real Me, little thing that she was. Something warm, then hot, burning bright and quick and raging. A crush? First Love? Dumb Young Romance? Something close to the first kind of affection she felt she could get without having to beg for it. It felt... nice. 

The relationship bloomed and gave her some comfort as the shit at home got even shittier (somehow). Two years and four months later, everything came. Crashing. Down. 

Spiraling out of control, The Real Me kind of.... gave up. Died a bit. She fell into a bout of Depression that lasted maybe five months or so. Barely eating or drinking fluids, not even showering for two weeks solid at most. Being tossed aside so easily after finding someone that cared, that felt like her best friend, was more than she could bear. 

In the last bit of those five months, came The Second.

You could tell I wasn't really looking at physicality this time by the way he looked. He was heavy set, only half a head taller than me, with a big belly and a soft round face. Cuban descent, pale as could be, Nerdy as they came, with a big poof of curly black on his head. His teeth weren't straight, his hands shook with uncertainty, and his glasses always sat a milimeter crooked on one side or the other. He came from a Mexican/Cuban Family that was sort of like mine. 

That should have thrown up some red flags REAL QUICK. But, as it turns out, ANY excuse to get out of the pit that was my depression was a good one. Even this guy. 

He became my best friend. He showed me his friends. We all hung out and shared jokes and were part of the beginning of the meme culture that has now blossomed in today's world. I graduated in Maroon and Silver, with my boyfriend cheering me on and whooping and hollering the loudest as I walked across that stage, my two colored tassle with the number 14 hanging in front of my left eye swinging back and forth. I entered the world of College. And he cheered me on, even through the resentment that he had failed college himself, wishing he could go back. 
Through financial strain, family problems, and my growing desire for physical intimacy, it was hard for us to find peace in anything but each other. Take his Mom's car, ride around town for hours, up and down Montrose, Westheimer, Richmond, from River Oaks to Bellaire, back to the Galleria, Spring Branch, Northside, even Midtown. Eat at every place we saw that fit our budget. Play games together on the Playstation or the computer. And Sex. Lots of it. 

But, having been watching our respective families show their real colors, and getting even harder on us individually, it took its toll. I was beginning to resent the control my parents wanted to still impose on me, and the choking nature his parents wanted to watch us, like buzzards circling roadkill. It was maddening. 

But then I started to notice something that had been going on for most of my relationship with this guy. 
I started to see him cracking. And remembered that he'd been acting this way for a long time. Clinging to me, making remarks when I said someone looked good. Wanting Sex a LOT. Even when I wasn't wanting it. And pressuring me and convincing me to do it anyway. There was a lot of insecurity. And I couldn't fix it. I tried, silly me, but I shouldn't have. And I began to distance myself from the rose colored glasses and saw the relationship for what it was. And after two and a half years of being with him, I had had ENOUGH. I ended the relationship, knowing that I was essentially the confidence boost to his very underdeveloped ego. 

After all that, I went forward in college trying to stay motivated. But the depression came back. It hit me hard, smacked me down, dragged me across the pavement, and kicked me out of college to start living my life as a wanna-be citizen of this country working hard for little pay. I fought with my mind, my heart, my physical desires for about a year, making friends and then promptly throwing them into my issue-ridden closet for them to see me for what I was back then. 

Something Else. 

The Real Me was chained up in the darkest corner of my mind, of her own free will. She was scared of the light, shaking, pissing herself, with the Dark Thing lording over the body and terrorizing her newfound friends. Including the ones that I was interested in romantically. Kinda. I was growing to want to be in a romantic relationship again. But this time I was so focused on having friends and getting to know people BEFORE I dated anyone that it seemed every friend I made just wanted to stay friends. And even though I still have most of these friends, the close ones (at this point there's only really  4) they are the only ones I'm close to. Therefore the only ones I trust the most. And it leaves me in a predicament. 

I am fearful to open myself up again. To try and let The Real Me out once again. The little one that felt love and wanted more, and has always loved everyone in the purest way. The one that looks at her friends with the dearest care and respect. The one that is starting to thirst for the real world again. 

She loves strongly. She sees her friends, close and otherwise, and tries to give them what support they need and want, as little or as much as they ask, but I always keep her in check to make sure it's not wearing her down like before. And she always wants to be close, intimate in sweet ways, like hugging, holding, cuddling, giving little kisses on the cheek, saying ""I love you"" without fear of rejection. She always looks for the romantic side of life. The cheesey jokes, the cheeky inuenndos, the lazy days on voice chat with a friend all day while they're at work or at home doing their thing but wanting company. She's pure and sweet and never gets jealous, never gets too angry, never thinks in absolutes. She's grown a bit. 

But she's still so fresh.

I have seen a lot in so little time, it seems. Being 22, you'd say ""Oh, give it time, you'll find someone!"" You're right, I can give it time, and the opportunity will come along, and I can enter a romantic relationship again. But who will it be? Will we make the right choice this time? Let the right one in? 

Maybe. 

But the little one, the pure one, wants to say something to her close friends, the ones she loves the strongest. The ones she wishes she could give the world to. 

Hey there you guys and girls. I'm so happy to see you. Your hair, short, thick, long, curly, sitting on your head, brown, blonde, firey orange, hidden under hats and bound in ties. Your eyes, hazel, brown, blue, green, golden even. Your stature, always somehow taller than me! I will never tire looking up at you. I'd share a hug with you, either with arms that comfortably wrap around me at the same sort of height, or that completely engulf me in the embrace of a giant. When we go swimming in the heat, your bare chest shining in the sunlight, barely a whisker on you, or the times we lay there shirtless, I in my bra, you showcasing your wonderful fluff! Or, maybe even lazly lounging on the couch, your soft peach fuzz covered self, a bit bigger than me, giving me a comforting cloud of friend to lay against. All of it is so wonderful! I love making you laugh, guffaws that vibrate my bones, high pitched giggles that send me into fits, light hearted and pure sounds of joy as they rapid fire from your shaking frame. I can even get you wheezing sometimes, unable to contain yourself, falling silent as you fail to take in enough air for a proper laugh! Tears fall from my eyes, my stomach aches, I can't breathe either, as we share in some joke or stupid comment or wonderful moment!

There are moment's when I'm down, or you are, and we give each other hugs, I may kiss your cheek, I will squeeze you tight, or while I'm on chat with you I'll send you every sweet sticker I can find on my device, hugs and glomps and full on jump tackles! We talk about the issue, we sort it out, I get myself right or you do. We may disagree, but we come back. We settle down. We sort it out. And we will walk away happier, good, or just better than before. I will never tire of talking, texting, messaging, voice chatting, especially when you need me, or I may need you. I hope my friendship with you means something good, something important. Because yours matters a lot to me! And I will always love you. No matter where life takes you or me! 
Maybe you're the best friend I haven't made yet. Maybe you're the one I grow to love later on than this! I hope we're best friends regardless if I am in a romantic relationship with you or not. I just wanna have fun and be merry. I wanna sort out problems and work together and I won't get upset and quit at the slightes sign of struggle. I won't give up so easily again. I will let you do your things and you'll let me do mine, and then we'll do stuff together! 

What I want, in this whole world, now that I've been born, died, and came back, and learned, is this: 
I want to love, be loved, and have fun. Friend, Lover, Family, even you Stranger. Take some love from me. Pass it on. Show the world the care and affection it deserves. Don't give out too much all at once, you'll burn away like I did. Worry not for how people will judge you. People say I loved too much, do hard, too many times. Too many chances, too many times I've forgiven and let go. 

But I'll never stop loving. I'll never stop giving to those I care for. Because I have so much of it now, all within me, wishing to burst forth, that if I don't, I might surely explode! And I don't expect all that much in return. The simple things in life fuel me now. And I will always be here. 

I will always stay strong.

I entered the world of College. And he cheered me on, even through the resentment that he had failed college himself, wishing he could go back. 
Through financial strain, family problems, and my growing desire for physical intimacy, it was hard for us to find peace in anything but each other. Take his Mom&amp;#39;s car, ride around town for hours, up and down Montrose, Westheimer, Richmond, from River Oaks to Bellaire, back to the Galleria, Spring Branch, Northside, even Midtown. Eat at every place we saw that fit our budget. Play games together on the Playstation or the computer. And Sex. Lots of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, having been watching our respective families show their real colors, and getting even harder on us individually, it took its toll. I was beginning to resent the control my parents wanted to still impose on me, and the choking nature his parents wanted to watch us, like buzzards circling roadkill. It was maddening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I started to notice something that had been going on for most of my relationship with this guy. 
I started to see him cracking. And remembered that he&amp;#39;d been acting this way for a long time. Clinging to me, making remarks when I said someone looked good. Wanting Sex a LOT. Even when I wasn&amp;#39;t wanting it. And pressuring me and convincing me to do it anyway. There was a lot of insecurity. And I couldn&amp;#39;t fix it. I tried, silly me, but I shouldn&amp;#39;t have. And I began to distance myself from the rose colored glasses and saw the relationship for what it was. And after two and a half years of being with him, I had had ENOUGH. I ended the relationship, knowing that I was essentially the confidence boost to his very underdeveloped ego. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all that, I went forward in college trying to stay motivated. But the depression came back. It hit me hard, smacked me down, dragged me across the pavement, and kicked me out of college to start living my life as a wanna-be citizen of this country working hard for little pay. I fought with my mind, my heart, my physical desires for about a year, making friends and then promptly throwing them into my issue-ridden closet for them to see me for what I was back then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something Else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Real Me was chained up in the darkest corner of my mind, of her own free will. She was scared of the light, shaking, pissing herself, with the Dark Thing lording over the body and terrorizing her newfound friends. Including the ones that I was interested in romantically. Kinda. I was growing to want to be in a romantic relationship again. But this time I was so focused on having friends and getting to know people BEFORE I dated anyone that it seemed every friend I made just wanted to stay friends. And even though I still have most of these friends, the close ones (at this point there&amp;#39;s only really  4) they are the only ones I&amp;#39;m close to. Therefore the only ones I trust the most. And it leaves me in a predicament. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am fearful to open myself up again. To try and let The Real Me out once again. The little one that felt love and wanted more, and has always loved everyone in the purest way. The one that looks at her friends with the dearest care and respect. The one that is starting to thirst for the real world again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She loves strongly. She sees her friends, close and otherwise, and tries to give them what support they need and want, as little or as much as they ask, but I always keep her in check to make sure it&amp;#39;s not wearing her down like before. And she always wants to be close, intimate in sweet ways, like hugging, holding, cuddling, giving little kisses on the cheek, saying &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot; without fear of rejection. She always looks for the romantic side of life. The cheesey jokes, the cheeky inuenndos, the lazy days on voice chat with a friend all day while they&amp;#39;re at work or at home doing their thing but wanting company. She&amp;#39;s pure and sweet and never gets jealous, never gets too angry, never thinks in absolutes. She&amp;#39;s grown a bit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she&amp;#39;s still so fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen a lot in so little time, it seems. Being 22, you&amp;#39;d say &amp;quot;Oh, give it time, you&amp;#39;ll find someone!&amp;quot; You&amp;#39;re right, I can give it time, and the opportunity will come along, and I can enter a romantic relationship again. But who will it be? Will we make the right choice this time? Let the right one in? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the little one, the pure one, wants to say something to her close friends, the ones she loves the strongest. The ones she wishes she could give the world to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey there you guys and girls. I&amp;#39;m so happy to see you. Your hair, short, thick, long, curly, sitting on your head, brown, blonde, firey orange, hidden under hats and bound in ties. Your eyes, hazel, brown, blue, green, golden even. Your stature, always somehow taller than me! I will never tire looking up at you. I&amp;#39;d share a hug with you, either with arms that comfortably wrap around me at the same sort of height, or that completely engulf me in the embrace of a giant. When we go swimming in the heat, your bare chest shining in the sunlight, barely a whisker on you, or the times we lay there shirtless, I in my bra, you showcasing your wonderful fluff! Or, maybe even lazly lounging on the couch, your soft peach fuzz covered self, a bit bigger than me, giving me a comforting cloud of friend to lay against. All of it is so wonderful! I love making you laugh, guffaws that vibrate my bones, high pitched giggles that send me into fits, light hearted and pure sounds of joy as they rapid fire from your shaking frame. I can even get you wheezing sometimes, unable to contain yourself, falling silent as you fail to take in enough air for a proper laugh! Tears fall from my eyes, my stomach aches, I can&amp;#39;t breathe either, as we share in some joke or stupid comment or wonderful moment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are moment&amp;#39;s when I&amp;#39;m down, or you are, and we give each other hugs, I may kiss your cheek, I will squeeze you tight, or while I&amp;#39;m on chat with you I&amp;#39;ll send you every sweet sticker I can find on my device, hugs and glomps and full on jump tackles! We talk about the issue, we sort it out, I get myself right or you do. We may disagree, but we come back. We settle down. We sort it out. And we will walk away happier, good, or just better than before. I will never tire of talking, texting, messaging, voice chatting, especially when you need me, or I may need you. I hope my friendship with you means something good, something important. Because yours matters a lot to me! And I will always love you. No matter where life takes you or me! 
Maybe you&amp;#39;re the best friend I haven&amp;#39;t made yet. Maybe you&amp;#39;re the one I grow to love later on than this! I hope we&amp;#39;re best friends regardless if I am in a romantic relationship with you or not. I just wanna have fun and be merry. I wanna sort out problems and work together and I won&amp;#39;t get upset and quit at the slightes sign of struggle. I won&amp;#39;t give up so easily again. I will let you do your things and you&amp;#39;ll let me do mine, and then we&amp;#39;ll do stuff together! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want, in this whole world, now that I&amp;#39;ve been born, died, and came back, and learned, is this: 
I want to love, be loved, and have fun. Friend, Lover, Family, even you Stranger. Take some love from me. Pass it on. Show the world the care and affection it deserves. Don&amp;#39;t give out too much all at once, you&amp;#39;ll burn away like I did. Worry not for how people will judge you. People say I loved too much, do hard, too many times. Too many chances, too many times I&amp;#39;ve forgiven and let go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;ll never stop loving. I&amp;#39;ll never stop giving to those I care for. Because I have so much of it now, all within me, wishing to burst forth, that if I don&amp;#39;t, I might surely explode! And I don&amp;#39;t expect all that much in return. The simple things in life fuel me now. And I will always be here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will always stay strong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[honestly I don&amp;#39;t know where this was going, but hey, someone might relate.]&lt;/p&gt;

Things are going wonderful with him, perhaps to good. At this point I would be in fear, like fear of losing this but.... Oddly I have none. It may be hard to believe but he has filled me with so much love that there is no room for fear. I've discovered that both emotions can't coexist in our hearts. Try feeling love and fear at once.... You can't! You either feel one or the other (try it). Like all women my emotions aren't stable and can vary in intensity and range. Yet when I come to him with my many moods he crowns them all with hugs and kisses. He knows that feminine nature is just like actual nature. Get it? It's not always sunny, sometimes there's storms and even disasters... He is my masculine stability and I can come to him however and find that stable Love that allows me to relax in his arms. He is different indeed, time passes and there's never any boredom with us. He keeps an element of mystery at all times that keeps me guessing. He shows up sometimes unexpectedly and tells me and shows me different things. I love it.  Also, the courtship phase never ended. How does he know that women want to live in a "" romantic novel"" forever? Idk but it keeps things alive when he constantly creates adventures and plots for me where I can remain young and beautiful forever for him. I think he lives for this... If he is feeling down all I have to do is wear something sexy and be affectionate and instantly his eyes light up. Sometimes a smile and a wink can inspire him to move the world for me or create me those love stories I love so much. I'm ranting now but I just feel the world needs romantics to inspire us all sometimes... Adieu

We left from my friend's place together.
Conversations on the cab ride home we're deep, like we spoke vaout how we cope with the issues we have.

She was ovulating and all my 5 senses knew it. My eyes were hungry today and she came to work dressed in a dress that provided a banquet.

Some women were placed on this earth to rattle men to their core and she was one of them. If these were prehistoric times I would've ravished her on sight. Of course, she knows all of this. Women of her beauty know that they cause ruckus where ever they go. Weak, insecure women hate on and envy them. Men on the other hand will risk it all 😂😂 but they dare not fuck her outside the confines of their minds, silly daydreams.

It stood confidently and by its graceful and feminine movements, I could tell a beautiful woman hid behind that shadowy mystery. She is the one today I thought and so I gathered my drink and thoughts, and walked towards her. Ernesto the bartender smiled and winked at me, he knew me so well by now. When I stood directly infront of her she was already greeting me with a smirk and careful eyes. ""You look stunning, mysterious and......you're not drinking anything? whats you're name pretty""?  She said nothing and just looked at me the way someone looks at a piece of unusual art. We exchanged gazes which meant we exchanged thoughts. When you carefully look into a woman's eyes she will reveal things to you. In this exchange her eyes told me she was happily taken. The smile that slowly accompanied, told me she appreciated the compliments because now she felt prettier. After our silent quick conversation I turned to walk away. ""KHAROLYNNE, my name is KHAROLYNNE "" she said. I smiled at her and walked back to Ernesto for an encore beverage.

At around 10:00 I finally realized they kept looking at us and giggling. When 11:45 rolled around, people started questioning new years kisses.

He said ""It's not THAT big of an age gap, same as Adara and I"" I ended up just refusing, and we just continued to hang out.
     Then, about 2 months later, we went skating, and once again, Heyley was home from college. The entire way to the skating rink, we talked. Obviously there was some giggling in the back I wasn't understanding at the time. My older brother Mike(18) was there too this time though.

Actually, thinking about it on the way to my father's home gave me the closest thing to a panic attack I have ever had.

I once met this Girl in the room of my guy when she came to charge her (only God knows what), then I fell partially in love with her. I collected her phone contact and I started courting her on WhatsApp which she consented.

In the space of a weeks, she demanded for airtime which I innocently sent her an amount of N1500(Naira, Nigeria currency). I believed we where flowing not until she asked again another airtime in the space of 5days, not that I hadn't the cash to send but I was just trying to use my common sense by telling her I will send but not immediately.
It was during this time I had a rethought about this and stop replying her messages on WhatsApp. We didn't communicate for about 2 months not until yesterday, she called me and said that she was angry with me for not contacting her for a long time. She said I should come to her hostel to see her.

I decided going to the hostel because I had in mind that after I see her, I will go to my Friend's lodge around that area.

Before i reached her hostel, i branched to a bank around my area but the crowd was enormous, I had to see her like that because I can't wait.
When I reached her hostel, i entered, she was on bum-short. She was like, where is my Valentine gift, I told her when I would be going home, we will branch to the bank, that I had no cash right there with me.

Her mood suddenly became gloomy but she didn't wanted making it obvious.

She asked if I would eat, I said no, she started using indirect means to make sure i lavish on her. Our conversion was like
She: My phone is really bad
Me: oh, really?
She: Yea.. It's a techno phone
Me: oh, nice phone.
She: but I can't use it because it's bad, I need a new phone
Me: No response*
She: you can get it for me as a Val gift.
Me: lol.. Yeah sure.
She: please let go to the bank now, Diamond bank(a bank in Nigeria) is very close
Me: The line is to much, I can't stand under the sun
She: You will wait here, I will go for you
Me: C'mon I can't give you my Atm
She: OK, you have Mobile App(a money transfer app) right? Please transfer some money for me so I will buy the phone
Me: I don't have a Mobile App
She: OK.. What about your sim? I can transfer with your sim, hope you registered your bank account with this sim?
Me: no, I didn't

I waiting for like 5min, and all she was talking was Money Money Money. I felt so uncomfortable And I told her to be ready that, on Saturday, I will send her the money and even take her out. I Collected her account details and boom, off I go.
I think, today would be the very last day I would chat or even communicate her again.

The kettle is whistling at me, letting me know that my much anticipated tea is ready. A small gesture from her part that brings a smile to my face. As I sip my tea,  another beautiful creature of the same essence  comes to mind......Violette. You see,  just like Violette the kettle is decorated with beautiful features. Rainbows, flowers and a sunset are illustrated on its cylindrical body. The arch that makes the handle is a clear substance with delicate little streaks of pink. Just a decoration? Not to me, what I see is inspiration, that particular inspiration that comes from the beauty of feminine energy. I like to think that the artist just like me had a keen eye for beauty. That the artist came  across his own Violette, and  that she stopped him dead in his tracks and stole his breath. At the same time she gave him the inspiration to create this kettle that at the moment is serving me my tea. The thought makes me smile. Today I will see her, oh Violette.... and I think she knows that I've already started an affair with her in my mind. Yes, she is married. Happily? Oh I don't know. Emotions are fickle they change day to day. What I do know is the look of unfulfillment in the eyes of Violette, curious eyes. I look in her eyes and see a thunderous storm at night time. You know, the kind with heavy rain, and a dark purple sky. Beautiful..... Violent winds and bright streaks of thunder illuminating the darkness. A storm that warns everyone to run for shelter..... but not because its dangerous but because that is all the storm knows and she is used to it. Oh Violette I am different. I will run outside and bathe in your violence and gaze at you're streaks of lightning with a smile on my face. I will stand there drenched for hours until your storm dies down. Then I will kiss the top of your head, and then hold your fragile little hands and unleash the wrath of the beautiful masculine. The thought makes me smile. I unplug my kettle and put my cup away then I head for the door.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Violette&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

I will run outside and bathe in your violence and gaze at you&amp;#39;re streaks of lightning with a smile on my face. I will stand there drenched for hours until your storm dies down. Then I will kiss the top of your head, and then hold your fragile little hands and unleash the wrath of the beautiful masculine. The thought makes me smile. I unplug my kettle and put my cup away then I head for the door.&lt;/p&gt;

I often think to myself how nice it would be to hold hands with a girl and walk through a forest or a park. I also think about how nice it would feel to hug a girl tightly. 

I want a girlfriend but at the same time I don't as most girls my age are unpleasant to be around. I also go to an all boys school, so that's a problem. I think of going to an all boys school as a good thing and a bad thing because I can't talk to girls at all. But I think it's also a good thing because I'm scared all the girls and boys that are complete assholes will make fun of me. I really don't what to do. I'm conflicted. 

There is a girl called Becky I see every now and then because her school is close to mine. (She goes to an all girls school btw) and she's really cute and nice and I'd really want to get to know her more but everytime I see her, the only thing I can do is say ""Hi"" like the awkward idiot I am. I think about her sometimes and I even fantasised about us being married once. 

I'm not trying toot my own horn but I think I'd make a good boyfriend. I'm willing to her 100% of the time, even when she's being an idiot. I'm willing to give her space if she needs it. I'm willing to treat her like a princess and do a fuck ton of other things. I'm not just talking about becky btw. But this will likely never be the case. I'll probably never find anyone. I have low self esteem, I'm chubby, annoying, unapproachable, stupid and plenty of other things. 

I really need help. As you can clearly see by this post, I'm not good at communicating with anyone. Any solutions on how to fix my loneliness? Any help would be appreciated.

UPDATE: 17th March - thank you to anyone who has responded to me so far. I've read every response but haven't replied to them all as I'm kind of awkward and don't want to repeat myself because then it looks like I'm not really being grateful.

TIBETE – o novo romance de Silas Corrêa Leite – E quando você não quiser mais ser gente?
-O novo romance do escritor Silas Corrêa Leite, lançado ao final do ano passado pela Editora Jaguatirica, RJ, vem bem a calhar, tendo em vista o tenebroso momento em que se resta o Planeta Terra, e particularmente o Brasil também em crise sem precedentes históricos, em que há uma falência generalizada de valores e estruturas sociais, terrivelmente depondo com o que deveria ser o público fito ético-plural-comunitário da  sociedade nesses tempos de falta de qualidade de vida e de uma convivência humana de baixíssimo nível. Fugir seria a melhor estratégia? Loucos escrevem. Céu ou inferno moram nos desfechos?  O personagem principal do livro, nesse contexto todo relata sobre as tormentas de um ex-escritor marcado, com altos e baixos na vida, mas, afinal evoluído socialmente falando, e que num estranho súbito momento, um bendito dia saca que não é feliz; avalia que o que conquistou não o satisfaz, quando conclui que “vencer na vida” não é tudo, não significa nada, não faz sentido, e, parafraseando Caetano veloso se questiona: tudo o que conquistou, a que será que se destina? Fechamento de ciclo.
De cara resolve pular fora do sistema, da redoma de infernos que é seu meio conturbado. Larga tudo e vai em busca de um lugar para chamar de céu, um infinito particular que seja. Quer um canto para se esconder de ser gente, de ver gente, se tratar de si, se reconciliar, cavar uma trilha, um buraco, antes que faça uma besteira... Estresse e paranoia de finalmente se descobrir sendo uma coisa que não quis ao final de tudo, passando da idade do lobo.
Volta para sua aldeia, Itararé-SP, foge de existir. Lá vai morar no mato, mal sabendo lavar um par de meias, um lenço, ou fritar um ovo. Terá que, numa emergencial e improvisada cultura de subsistência, adaptar-se na marra, longe da urbanidade tantã e da civilização em derrocada, para repensar o caminho que fez, como se numa espécie de jornada espiritual de recolhimento temporão, de reconciliação e mesmo de depuração de sua interioridade ferida, de sua sensibilidade lixada de ver, fermentar, engolir sapos, aceitar regras, chorar, sofrer, conviver, sobreviver... Com o mundo num labiríntico caos, com sua crise de identidade de turrão, concorrente, sedentário, já obeso, calvo e com problemas de saúde, além de síndromes pintando num campo minado de cobranças ridículas, entre boletos de posses e sachês viciados de poses insatisfatórias, mais doenças paraexistenciais e questionamentos de neuras, o personagem enquanto se adapta num barracão dentro de um manto de selva, vai relembrando o que sofreu, as perdas e danos, idas e vindas, traições e incompletudes, cartéis e cassinos, bolando artes loucas dentro do funil da crise de perquirir, ao mesmo tempo em que compactua com o recanto que ergueu pra si, e confronta a natureza primária pertinho o abraçando e sustentando, na sua  busca de paz, o terrível encontro consigo mesmo, pela frustração com tudo, o nada que é tudo, feito um desorientado cidadão pós-moderno num mundo corrompido, procurando se achar enquanto há tempo. 
Na capa do romance de 382 páginas, o aviso: “Destruam este diário, ou destruam suas vidas”. A obra é isso mesmo, uma espécie de diário de resistência e luta, de busca da reformatação do ser, de uma transformação radical, mais, a de busca de um buraco para se encaixar depois de questionamentos, se isolando feito um Tibete íntimo, uma guarita, uma cápsula de nave, um jardim secreto, um esconderijo, uma Pasárgada, uma Shangri-lá, que é na emergência da situação de conflito e confronto, a periferia rural de Itararé, na lonjura distante de um lugar em que o judas perdeu o All-Star. 
O deslocado personagem meio eremita que sonha um Mosteiro Ateu ou um Monastério Lico, as vezes introspectivo, de acordo com a lua, as vezes anarquista libertário, ou romântico sonhador da pá virada, quando não incendiário, perigoso, detona tudo, registra, narra, incendeia irrazões. E o leitor sendo testado, também vai acabar fazendo uma viagem de recolhimento que o livro Tibete faculta e induz, antes que venha o cometa ou o cavalo amarelo do Apocalipse. Vai nessa toada o romance.
Lendo o Tibete você sofre, se encontra, revolta, se confronta, assusta mas se requalifica, a repensar melhor sua vidinha merreca e seus infernos de grifes, impropriedades, consumismo e obrigações piradas de meros vazios existenciais. E pode clarear a mente adubada pela mídia abutre; deixar de ser bovinamente refém do consumismo irado, começando assim a vitimizar conquistas espúrias, pois, como diz Raul Seixas, “Quem entra em buraco de rato/De rato tem que transar”. Nesse mundo insano, vencer numa sociedade assim não significa nada, muito menos mérito notório.  Liberte-se também. Leia Tibete e também Tibete-se. Eis o verbo

So here i was again a place i know almost too good , the beach, being lifeguard was an escape i tend to run to everytime i feel life gets a bit too heavy.As a lifeguard girls come and go, at least is what i thought before i met HER.
It started like every other boring morning on the beach only this day they moved me to new station, few hours of chatting with my partner ,and oh my... i was not prepared for what is about to happen, there she was, she passed next to me just out of arm reach as like she knew this game way too good, for a meer second i caught a glance of her eyes as we made eye contact, somehow our smiles got erased as like if we where in shock of seeing someone you knowed all your life but lost contact with a lifetime ago... I felt some overwhelming attraction i never wanted to touch someone so much in my life before, but thats not how the game is played so i had to act cool.I waited for her to go on her sunbed gave her some minutes to rise her interest, and here i go making my lion walk towards her, having an emotional chaos in my head,some panic attacks some excitement and an ounce of arousal.So here i was standing next to her in all my lifeguard ""glory"" making sentence from combining words from 3-4 languages as i was trying to understand where she was from.She responded in russian. Her voice was just as i imagined to be like if i knew her from a dream or a past life.The shock was still there we spoke like strangers but our eyes spoke like we had few lives together behind us.I asked her if she wants to go for a ride with the lifeguard boat, she refused just to show me where my place was, and that im not in control of the situation yet. My heart was pounding but there is no way i was backing off, so i proceeded to as her out after work hours gladly she left me without answer but gave me her instagram which was enough ""yes"" for me.The work day was over i went to gym like i did every other day for the entire summer, but i couldnt focus i was excited so much to see where this will go so i finished with my halfish training session and here i was on my mobile all sweaty not from training but from being nervous about going out tonight with this girl, that stranger i knew since forever, so i send her some casual icebrakers, i didnt want to look too cocky as i usually do.She agreed on going out with me and i asked what she prefers talk and drink on the beach in the night or go to clubs/bars and she chose beach and i hoped she did, loud bars and clubs end up in one night stands, and there was just something more in that girl.So we arranged a meeting in front of her hotel in 19:45 i was there 19:45 waited for her ~1 minute, as both of us knew that the game rules have changed and we aint playing.Here she was standing in front of me with her dark deep brown eyes, her amazing lips that looked so tasty i focused on them for a moment , and she knew what she had and she smiled in approval.The conversation started in an ease all the right questions followed by all the right answers, as we where proceeding to a very special place i had and i shared only with people i trusted because it had it all it was very close to the sea and no one ever went there because it was lifeguard area and it was hard to reach.So here we where some DeepHouse/ChillStep songs from my BT speaker some scotch in plastic cups and just two souls connecting after long time apart.I was amazed of how this girl was looking at life she was nothing like all the other girls i have spoke with and here is the time i will tell you her name...
Anna was a Belarusian girl from humble family on vacation in Bulgaria that was arranged by her brother as a gift for her 21th birthday.
...We continued drinking and speaking no on felt the need to take control or advantage over the other we where just two souls speaking and vibing on the same level no one was superior in any way.As the night was growing older and the scotch was getting lower, the excitement got me adventurous and i started getting  my clothes of not to make my move towards her but to go in for a night swim, i asked her if she was ""free enough"" to come and swim in the moonpath (we had a full-moon this night of course).She was a bit scared of the idea i jumped from the edge of  the lifeguard station and i here i was on the sand only with my underpants going towards the water with my back facing it because i had to see what she will do in the situation, she tried to jump too from the station but a bit unsure so i reached to help her and before i knew it my hands where on her ass (station was 10ft tall) helping her go down safely as i lowered her to the ground she stood in front of me looking me in the eye, it was the time for that so waited kiss but i thought if we are in the flow lets just make it a bit more interesting for her. and i turned around and started running towards the water i jumped and submerged and started swimming underwater just to make her uneasy and to play with her. 1-2 minutes after i emerged from water and there she was standing in knees deep refusing to get undressed and i had no problem with that because she looked amazing under the moonlight with her skirt not too short and her plain white shirt fitting her like it was made for her body exclusively.I proceeded towards her slowly fixing my hair playing with water making the moment longer for maximum affection and here i was in front of her wet , half-naked smelling like booze , sea-salt, and just enough leftover from my cologne to make the combination perfect. I asked her with deep voice if she was afraid to get wet in answer she just smiled and said she dont want to get her clothes wet, in that moment i grabbed her waist and pulled her towards me firmly she didnt mind that i made her all wet she was afraid and excited in the same time.As my hearth was allover the place i proceeded towards her tasty lips but just when i was about to kiss her i stopped and prolonged the moment giving her choice if she wants this or not... i looked in her eyes and i saw that she want this as much as i do and we kissed, it was not only a kiss it was a memory of something that happened before something that striked you once and disappeared leaving you searching , craving... it was a moment of reunion of two souls lost in past life it was my nirvana.We stayed like this for some time kissing under the moonlight knees deep in the sea.After we went back to the lifeguard station all wet and cold stayed together under one blanked to keep eachother warm... I craved her touch as she was kissing me gently i was answering with a bit harder bites just enough for her to feel the pain but enjoy it as well. I was losing control the urge to be closer to her was so gigantic i felt overwhelming need to fuck her, i wanted it so much but i was afraid that it may push her away, but at that point my mind was blurred by passion, booze and the sent of her skin, i started bite her neck kiss her shoulders she was seating in such way that her back was towards me she felt that my dick is hard and smiled playfully about it... in this moment i was sure we are fucking tonight and it will be the best night of my life.I turned her around and put her legs around my waist she was playing along in this time, i felt how wet she was when i touched the heart of her femininity, she was ready for me as much i was ready for her but no... she kept saying no, she said it needs to be more than this, and i knew its going to be more than this but i knew i cant make her believe it with words so i backed off. we kept cuddling and watching the moon that night.I went in my room somewhere in the morning few hours before work time (didnt sleep a minute).
I couldnt wait to go to my station i knew she was going to be there and her smile will cure all my pains.There i was opening my station looking at her hotel every few minutes expecting to spot her coming. It was few hours before she woke up and wrote me that she is coming soon, i felt relief.Here she was in all her grace going down the stairs slowly and after her was her brother who as you may have guessed was overprotective as fuck... so we acted a bit like nothing has happened the other night... She texted me if i want to go for a swim and before i saw what else she was texting i was galloping towards the water in such mather as if someone was drowning and im going in to save him. She followed right after but gracefully with patience a patience i didnt have at this time. The moment she stood in front of me i felt like my heart will stop , i took her hand underwater and pulled her towards me and started kissing her she didnt mind her brother looking and it was perfectly fine with me.We stayed in water for hour or so speaking again just this never ending conversations that i couldnt have with no one else and i knew her only for 24h.We spoke about books she likes and mysteries of the world.In all this time i was afraid to ask how much time is she going to stay in Bulgaria,but i had to and i did, the moment i asked the question her face went grey like if the alarm clock pulled her out of her dream on a monday morning.She said it was her last day here and we have to make it count, i needed a moment to stop all the thoughts that where flooding my mind, and i answered, ""YES!!!"" so the day continued we talked for some hours more kissing in the water hugging occasionally ass-grabbing boner play and just overall play with eachothers arousal.We made a plan for date but only this time it would be in a restaurant, and i knew the perfect place it was a small restaurant hanging over the sea on a cliff with some amazing view.And here i was waiting in the same place i waited last night but this time i was not nervous i felt like i wait for my girl as i was waiting for a person i knew since forever, dont get me wrong my heart was everywhere i felt it in my neck.The revolving door of the hotel was in motion and i felt a slight disappointment every time a person came out that was not her, the few minutes i waited felt like forever but in the end it was all worth it here she was once again stunning me from the second i see her, this time in tight grey dress again fitting her like if it was act of magic.We proceeded towards the restaurant which was a 20min walk away, those 20 minutes i cherish every day since, it was the time she just repeated everything that was going tru my head these 2 days , she said that it felt like we know each other from other life and that she feels some overwhelming emotion towards me that is a bit scary and exciting at the same time, that she was looking for me all her life and she dont  know what we should do once she goes back to Belarus, and we decided not to think about this until the last hour so we can enjoy every moment like if it was going to last for eternity, so here we are beautiful inlove and stupid in this amazing restaurant drinking white wine eating whatever the sea provides prepared with passion. Hours where flying and no wonder it was just like puzzle where i had half of the parts and she had the other everything just few in place, after the third bottle of wine we where drunk enough to go and do some stupid shit and enjoy it, so we went to the centre where all the clubs bars and places are and for few hours we keep bouncing from bar to bar dancing drinking shots kissing and just enjoying eachother to the fullest, and as we where ordering the next round of shots i caught her looking at me with wet eyes and i just froze in place i asked her what is wrong, she answered that she dont want this to end and that its not fair that we can have this only now at this moment i made a decision to not let this be only a summer fling and i said to her we will keep in touch and we wont let it die, after i said this she asked me if we can go back to ""our place"" it was the place on the beach we went last night, so we went the night was young so we had some time to be happy and sad in the same time.As we approached the place i was thinking of a way to fuck her brains out but in the same time to show her that i mean good that im not a fuckboy and that all i spoke about before was words from deep inside me. I wasnt able to think of something so i chose to go with the flow again we kissed a lot we spoke a lot... i started advancing towards her soaking wet pussy and this time she let me... i was so excited my dick was 110% hard my mind was blurred again by all the booze and the chemicals my brain was pouring from the overwhelming emotion this girl was provoking in me... i enjoyed every moan i enjoyed every bite so was she... in one time she gave up and grabbed my dick and started stroking it super slow as she was enjoying it as much as i do, she never broke eye contact with me she knew exactly how she make me feel and she was high on that feeling.She made me cum in some minutes and said that its all i will get for now. I felt like a little boy but still i fell even further inlove with her. The other morning i felt like crap i knew she will come on the beach for 1-2 hours and after she will go back to Belarus and who knows what will happen. So i got to the beach and waited for her she came we spoke she dropped i tear and something in me broke and tears where running down my cheeks she started smiling with wet eyes we laughed together without too many words we understanded how beautiful stupid and perfect the situation is... It was time... I was saying goodbye to the best thing that ever happened in my life (tear goes down my cheek now writing this).I was standing there watching how she goes back the stairs for the last time the same stairs i watched with hope i now watch with broken heart i knew its not the end but still it felt so bad, the moment i lost sight of her i sat on my station looking at the sea with a bit of disgust i wanted to ask it where all its beauty went. Few days i stayed numb didnt ate much didnt slept much, the brief moments we text or speak make the pain go away but it was just a short pain relief, after the pain was coming back stronger and stronger... one week like this got me questioning all my decisions before i understood that i was focusing on the wrong shit in life...After that one week i got to conclusion that i was ready to regret my decision but i was not ready to not make a decision and have questions without answers all my life. So i called Anna and asked her how we can see each other soon and we spoke about it she was super excited and i asked if its ok if i come to Belarus and she was so into it... But for Belarus i need visa and it would have taken more time that both we wanted to wait. So we decided that she come again because its easier and the plan was there... I felt so good of the idea that somewhere in the time i have a date in which i will see her eyes again it made waiting easier.So i find this nice place in Bulgaria - Velingrad its ""The SPA Capital of EU"" (as said in ad :D) i booked a room for 6 days... 
The date was 13 Sep. The airport.Waiting. My heart is pounding i still cant believe this girl will come again to see a guy she met for 2 days in a summer vacation, it was just surreal. 
...The door of the airport GATE opens some old lady with funny hat with her little dog and her little grandson... it open again several times every time mini heart attack... and finally it was her i havent seen her in quite a while but she was there it was her the girl from the beach the girl from my past life the missing part...
She looks at me with confusion the same happens with me i can only guess she felt the same like me its overwhelming emotions in all directions its like some wicked drug hits you in all the right places , in my head is ""noodle soup"" i dont know what to do should i run and hug her should i cry should i smile and i felt like i want to do all this simultimously...and i did i was smiling and crying but her hair was all over my face and its all that mattered.As we where going towards my friends car(he was going to drive us to Velingrad and after take us back)we couldnt brake eye contact it was so surreal that we where afraid that if we look somewhere else even for the slightest moment it will disappear like a mirage in scourged desert.We sat in the back of the car just speaking with eyes kissing and being grateful for being able to feel alive again.We went to the hotel it was all nice and the room was amazing (will provide videos and photos).So we made a plan to get dressed and go to take food in the hotels restaurant and we almost did... so im getting dressed putting some shirt with my black slim jeans while she was putting make up, i was staying there ready and watching her put make up in the mirror when suddenly she looked at me tru the mirror and winked... This got me mental i lost all control and just took her by the waist and threw her on the bed she looked me with excitement and for a mere moment i was all over her i dont even remember removing her clothes or mine i just remember when i start going down from her neck towards her breasts down the stomach and slowly approaching the core... The moment my dick managed to reach the sweet spot she grabbed my head and forced it deep inside her i was so into it and she was so wet i continued to eat her out until she came after that i turned her around on her stomach put a pillow under it and started going inside her very slow while kissing her back and going towards her neck only when i reached her ear i started talking dirty and penetrated her fully i felt her storm of emotions when she clinged my dick with her thighs she wanted me as bad as i wanted her and all else ceased to exist in that exact moment... For the next six days it was all pure passion nothing unnecessary... order food for the room bottle of wine every now and then. primal fucking, throw some ""I love you"" and that cute little girl that i grew so fond of just became everything i have ever dreamed about, she was good talk good fuck good vibes she had it all, but like anything good it had to end sometime.
Here we are again at the same airport that gave me everything now waits there grey and cold to take it back away, we stood for 2 hours until her gate was almost closed , just staying together looking in eachothers eyes just replaying all the moments we have just experienced in these six days.""LAST CALL FOR...""  The voice on the speaker yelled with ugly voice as if it was some stone cold judge in a court serving the death sentence to you for something you didnt do... but this time i knew we have future and that gave me energy to change my life entirely to want to be better for her we saw again around Christmas and our next meeting will be in april when i will go to Belarus to meet with her parents and pop the question. I text a lot with her best friend and we teamed up to make everything possible. The problem here is i dont make enough money for everything i need for the proposal but i work my ass off and i hope all will be good i Work on 2 jobs and try to buy and resell some shit in order to get some cash for the ring and surprise... Wish me LUCK. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I dont know how to start this and im sorry in advance for bad english every here and there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here i was again a place i know almost too good , the beach, being lifeguard was an escape i tend to run to everytime i feel life gets a bit too heavy.As a lifeguard girls come and go, at least is what i thought before i met HER.
It started like every other boring morning on the beach only this day they moved me to new station, few hours of chatting with my partner ,and oh my... i was not prepared for what is about to happen, there she was, she passed next to me just out of arm reach as like she knew this game way too good, for a meer second i caught a glance of her eyes as we made eye contact, somehow our smiles got erased as like if we where in shock of seeing someone you knowed all your life but lost contact with a lifetime ago... I felt some overwhelming attraction i never wanted to touch someone so much in my life before, but thats not how the game is played so i had to act cool.I waited for her to go on her sunbed gave her some minutes to rise her interest, and here i go making my lion walk towards her, having an emotional chaos in my head,some panic attacks some excitement and an ounce of arousal.So here i was standing next to her in all my lifeguard &amp;quot;glory&amp;quot; making sentence from combining words from 3-4 languages as i was trying to understand where she was from.She responded in russian. Her voice was just as i imagined to be like if i knew her from a dream or a past life.The shock was still there we spoke like strangers but our eyes spoke like we had few lives together behind us.I asked her if she wants to go for a ride with the lifeguard boat, she refused just to show me where my place was, and that im not in control of the situation yet. My heart was pounding but there is no way i was backing off, so i proceeded to as her out after work hours gladly she left me without answer but gave me her instagram which was enough &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; for me.The work day was over i went to gym like i did every other day for the entire summer, but i couldnt focus i was excited so much to see where this will go so i finished with my halfish training session and here i was on my mobile all sweaty not from training but from being nervous about going out tonight with this girl, that stranger i knew since forever, so i send her some casual icebrakers, i didnt want to look too cocky as i usually do.She agreed on going out with me and i asked what she prefers talk and drink on the beach in the night or go to clubs/bars and she chose beach and i hoped she did, loud bars and clubs end up in one night stands, and there was just something more in that girl.So we arranged a meeting in front of her hotel in 19:45 i was there 19:45 waited for her ~1 minute, as both of us knew that the game rules have changed and we aint playing.Here she was standing in front of me with her dark deep brown eyes, her amazing lips that looked so tasty i focused on them for a moment , and she knew what she had and she smiled in approval.The conversation started in an ease all the right questions followed by all the right answers, as we where proceeding to a very special place i had and i shared only with people i trusted because it had it all it was very close to the sea and no one ever went there because it was lifeguard area and it was hard to reach.So here we where some DeepHouse/ChillStep songs from my BT speaker some scotch in plastic cups and just two souls connecting after long time apart.I was amazed of how this girl was looking at life she was nothing like all the other girls i have spoke with and here is the time i will tell you her name...

Here we are again at the same airport that gave me everything now waits there grey and cold to take it back away, we stood for 2 hours until her gate was almost closed , just staying together looking in eachothers eyes just replaying all the moments we have just experienced in these six days.&amp;quot;LAST CALL FOR...&amp;quot;  The voice on the speaker yelled with ugly voice as if it was some stone cold judge in a court serving the death sentence to you for something you didnt do... but this time i knew we have future and that gave me energy to change my life entirely to want to be better for her we saw again around Christmas and our next meeting will be in april when i will go to Belarus to meet with her parents and pop the question. I text a lot with her best friend and we teamed up to make everything possible. The problem here is i dont make enough money for everything i need for the proposal but i work my ass off and i hope all will be good i Work on 2 jobs and try to buy and resell some shit in order to get some cash for the ring and surprise... Wish me LUCK. &lt;/p&gt;

If you want love,  your main priority is *not romance* in the relationship. It's *longevity*. Romance is just one of the many ways to keep the relationship fresh or interesting. Romance on its own *should not be a crutch*.

Keep in mind that this ranty post isn't on the sub either. From what I've seen, this sub is doing just fine. In fact, romance can help open up a relationship.
However, I would assert that once you get close to them, romance should be put on the back burner unless it's agreed upon.

Too many times I see people around me relying on romance because *they don't understand the person they're with*. Once again, romance should only be used if you *know* that your lover is the romantic type, but not as a last resort to try to prove to your partner you love them.

My perspective may be skewed because I am only a teenaged boy, so I would love any and all feedback.

I also made a video on a similar topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nfb9G6MZsO8","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello there.

And the real happiness lies in making others happy.

As said by Someone: “A good Life is a collection of happy Moments !”
Here are some ways to Woo your beloved on this Valentine Season:

1. One Rose says more than the Words! Put a strong impression of your Love by gifting a bunch of Red Rose and capture the smile on your partner’s face .

2. Why not give him/her a memorable gift ? The greatest gifts are not wrapped in paper but in love ! Whats best other than jewellery or accessories. Jewellery is the exclamation point of a girls outfit and same way accessories for men.

3. Add Some Sweetness to your love by variety of Chocolates. All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn’t hurt !

4. Give your Love the Token Of Promise, the promise to be with him/her for life time. But do not Forget to give a Hug ! They invented hug to let people know that you love them without saying anything.

5. The best gift you can give to someone is your Time ! Feel the Warmth of love and celebrate your cute and Personel moments with your partener by booking a Special Date OR short trip to some romantic place.

6. Book a candle night dinner and Spend Quality Time with your love and Celebrate the season of love and make the life time memories.

I am offering heartfelt, personalized cheap valentine notes, letters, phrases for cards, and poems based on **A.** Some
background on your partner/crush provided by yourself so ""stolen or ghostwritten"" becomes a lesser possibility and
**B.** Whatever vibe you're trying to get across: sexual, you are so the one I swear-ish, profound and emotional -
I can do it all; Just ask.

I am more than willing to provide examples of my work so that you can see if the technical craft
matches your needs.

I accept payment via Paypal and Bitcoin. The product will be in your hands after payment has been confirmed/received, and within 2-3 days, depending on what type of writing you've requested, you will receive a piece of my heart that is now your heart sent to your e-mail, messages, and so on.

Pricing is as follows:

 * Short note (Like you might leave on a pillow or on a card for a bouquet) **$3 USD**

* Poem (Will be about 3/4ths of a page-- you provide me with circumstances, details, memories; 
All of that. I'll make it happen. Even if your partner is suspicious that you wrote it, I can circumvent 
that by placing a false author name on it-- ""Nah, I couldn't write that. That's just a poem that's 
always reminded me of you) **$10 USD**

* Long Letter or E-mail (I will require some mundane writing samples from you so I can get a sense
 for how you write. Other than that, you inform the general sense of what the content is.) **$16** 
or market price dependent on length

This is not a drill or some fanfic bullshit. I teach English Comp and Lit at a university that has me work far too much for far little pay. I had this idea as both a way to make a little spending money and do good unto the world and all of that great shit.

(Also, I hate the name Patrick, that's what my mom was going to call me, so my friends started saying it because I hate it. These passages come from my own personal journal, and aren't edited because I'm lazy)

Faith is the most special, fragile, yet incredibly headstrong girl I have ever met. She is smarter than me, incredibly funny, and even stunning at times. She can be so adorable when wearing my jacket. For someone so fragile physically, she is the most untouchable person emotionally I have ever met. I admire (or enjoy) all of these characteristics. But beyond that, she's even better just to be around. She is so innocent yet not at the same time, you never know what you're gonna get with Fai. Like yesterday (11/28/17) after we had gotten home, I was showing Grant how light she was, and I was gonna pick her up, and she sees this and just wraps her legs around my waist as if that's perfectly normal. Then, when she's down, insists on a piggy back ride. Physical contact is her thing; I find it awkward, and she uses that to her advantage. If she's ever upset that she didn't get her way, she'll give it one last shot with a pouty face and a ""pwease Patwick?"" Before just forcing the physical contact. So basically she just lays on me till she gets her way. Lately she's added another last resort, the cold shoulder. In other terms, I'm ""whipped"" by my friend.
I guess this needs to be out there. Faith and I flirt. We don't intend to flirt, but we do. We also argue ""like an old married couple"". We overall, act a lot like a couple. We kinda cuddle, always touching when together, argue like an old married couple, flirt, and know each other well enough to make references that fly right over anyone else's heads. Sometimes I get the self awareness to see it too. Such as last night (11/28/17) when after the scholar's bowl meet Fai was telling MY embarrassing stories, while saying ""It's okay Patrick"" and running her fingers through my hair just the way I like. However, I chalk this up to our social awkwardness, rather than Fai liking me. I do see how we would look like a couple though. We do everything I've already said, we have what from the outside looks like pet names for each other, are each other's top bestfriends on snapchat, she pretty much has a reservation for my jacket, are always calling each other different forms of hoe, and are nigh inseparable at times. Even from the inside one can tell our relationship isn't normal. But honestly, that's why I love Faith and I's relationship so much; It's rather fitting. Neither of us are normal, so why should our relationship be? Just because it's an abnormal relationship doesn't mean it's a romantic one. People just don't understand that part. They find it so hard to understand that we aren't a couple, even though we act like one. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could write a 500 page book on this woman, but I&amp;#39;ll spare you the pain and keep it simple.
(Also, I hate the name Patrick, that&amp;#39;s what my mom was going to call me, so my friends started saying it because I hate it. These passages come from my own personal journal, and aren&amp;#39;t edited because I&amp;#39;m lazy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faith is the most special, fragile, yet incredibly headstrong girl I have ever met. She is smarter than me, incredibly funny, and even stunning at times. She can be so adorable when wearing my jacket. For someone so fragile physically, she is the most untouchable person emotionally I have ever met. I admire (or enjoy) all of these characteristics. But beyond that, she&amp;#39;s even better just to be around. She is so innocent yet not at the same time, you never know what you&amp;#39;re gonna get with Fai. Like yesterday (11/28/17) after we had gotten home, I was showing Grant how light she was, and I was gonna pick her up, and she sees this and just wraps her legs around my waist as if that&amp;#39;s perfectly normal. Then, when she&amp;#39;s down, insists on a piggy back ride. Physical contact is her thing; I find it awkward, and she uses that to her advantage. If she&amp;#39;s ever upset that she didn&amp;#39;t get her way, she&amp;#39;ll give it one last shot with a pouty face and a &amp;quot;pwease Patwick?&amp;quot; Before just forcing the physical contact. So basically she just lays on me till she gets her way. Lately she&amp;#39;s added another last resort, the cold shoulder. In other terms, I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;whipped&amp;quot; by my friend.
I guess this needs to be out there. Faith and I flirt. We don&amp;#39;t intend to flirt, but we do. We also argue &amp;quot;like an old married couple&amp;quot;. We overall, act a lot like a couple. We kinda cuddle, always touching when together, argue like an old married couple, flirt, and know each other well enough to make references that fly right over anyone else&amp;#39;s heads. Sometimes I get the self awareness to see it too. Such as last night (11/28/17) when after the scholar&amp;#39;s bowl meet Fai was telling MY embarrassing stories, while saying &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s okay Patrick&amp;quot; and running her fingers through my hair just the way I like. However, I chalk this up to our social awkwardness, rather than Fai liking me. I do see how we would look like a couple though. We do everything I&amp;#39;ve already said, we have what from the outside looks like pet names for each other, are each other&amp;#39;s top bestfriends on snapchat, she pretty much has a reservation for my jacket, are always calling each other different forms of hoe, and are nigh inseparable at times.

I was hoping for some input on a love letter I'm sending to a girl I have had a charged friendship with for several years. I essentially lay everything out in the letter if you have any questions let me know.

Dearest T,

I’m sorry if I did something the other night that put you off. That being said I just wanted to put my feelings onto paper so that hopefully you would understand.
    I have known you for the better part of 8 years, even though we didn’t really talk to one another in Jr. High other than from musicals. When I saw your post from way back when and decided to message you, it was not by any stretch out of pity. At that time you were more mature than me and you gave me an ideal. You inspired me to better myself at first, and through that I was able to grow to the point where I could care about myself. Previous to our date I had only ever been on awkward dates that were no fun at all, because of that it blew me away when we had so much fun so easily. We hung out a few more times and talked every night. Each day adding to my motivation, fueling my fire.
    Not too much longer after that you got back together with Gavin and I was a bit confused but I understood. There was no anger or anything of that nature in my heart. Then I moved up to Ogden, we kept in touch but it always seemed strained so I decided to focus on growth as an individual and left you to do whatever you wanted to do for the rest of your senior year.
    The summer of 2016 I took a big risk and decided to take a job on the other side of the country. This job tore me down and stripped me of any confidence I had built up over the last year since being an adult. I was rejected everyday, sometimes close to a hundred times per day. It got to the point where I was barely able to eat. At my lowest point over there I decided to hop on facebook and I saw that you were hurting too. I decided to message you just to say hey and see how you were holding up. For the next few weeks you kept me going. Just you messaging me and being nice to me when nobody else was, was enough for me to stay out on the doors. The thought of you made me want to be as successful as I could be, so that I could come back home having made enough money just to spoil you. In the end I buckled under the pressure and couldn’t go on any longer. By a stroke of magnificent luck I made it back to (REDACTED) without too much struggle.
    When I got back however,  the only thing I could think about was taking you out. We ended up going to 25th street and just walking around. That day still stands out in my mind as one of my favorite dates just because I could tell you cared at least a bit. I know I should have kissed you in that cave, and who knows what could have happened. Nonetheless when it came time for your graduation party, you having gotten back together with Gavin, I was still a shell of who I was before I left but I decided to go regardless of my feelings for you just to wish you luck and prosperity. 
I even now harbor no ill will towards you. I’m sure you didn’t realize how much you helped me but I wanted you to know that no matter what happens, no matter where life takes us, I will always care about you. You have inspired me many times to push myself to grow. You were the only source of light when my world was at its darkest. I can’t just idly sit by when I know you’re in so much pain.
    I know that you’ve said you’re a grenade but honestly T. I would jump on that grenade for you in a heartbeat. I owe a lot of who I have become, to you. You may believe that you’re beyond help but you’re not. I don't want to change you, I want to be there for you, to listen and hear about what’s stressing you out or what’s making you happy, to show you the light that you’ve shown me and to make you smile big toothy smiles so I can see the adorable gap in your teeth. I believe in the person you want to become. I know that you need space and I’m more than willing to give you as much as you need but please, let me be there for you like you were there for me. 
                    Cordially yours, and always extra

I stood against the wall trying to distance myself from the grotesque scene playing out before me. My gaze moved down to the floor watching the pool of dark crimson liquid growing larger and nearing my Jimmy Choo’s. I stepped to the side avoiding the advancing blood and tried to keep my food down. At times like this in my job, I try my best to tune out and focus on something..happier. Most of the time it doesn’t work. Like now. All I hear is the second man being interrogated and tortured whenever he doesn’t answer correctly. I can’t imagine what he is feeling right now. But given the accusations, he does deserve it. I glanced up seeing tall men on either side of me, their hands behind their backs. It’s not like I’m going anywhere. If I do, I’ll either be blackmailed or killed. My whole body jolted as a shot fired and I heard the thud. That sure didn’t last long. I kept my gaze down to the floor as even more blood painted the surface. 
“We are done here,” a low husky voice said. Black Oxford shoes walked past mine and the door opened. “Lena.” He demanded. Everytime he talks to me, a shiver runs through my spine. And not in the good way. 
“Yes, Boss, “ I answered quickly. I turned and followed after him. Now you must be thinking. How the hell did I get in this situation? Have you ever regretted a decision you made?  In my case it was a couple months back. I wanted to be a freelance photojournalist taking the jobs only I wanted. But then my old boss hired me for one last job, the wrong job, and shit went downhill from there.

Chapter 1
Lena

A few months ago. 
I woke up from my deep slumber, the sun hitting my eyes instantly. Guess I forgot to pull down the blinds again.  My eyes were irritated from the glaring light. I sat up in my cotton sheets, sliding out of bed and rubbing my feet on my furry white rug. I glanced over at my nightstand. 6:00 a.m. Sometimes I really just want to go back to sleep and never go outside in public again. But there is a thing called a job and bills that will not pay themselves. I groaned in annoyance and stood up ruffling my long, wavy, black hair that stopped almost at my waist. After doing my normal routine of brushing my teeth, washing my face and taking a quick shower, I got ready for my work day. I work for a private investigator - for now - since he is doing a case about recent murders happening in the city. I guess you could say I am an investigator too given I’m taking the photos. But sometimes I really am worried that I’m going to get shot one of these days. I walked over to my dresser and pulled out a simple white v neck, a black hoodie and some denim washed skinny jeans. After I pulled on all my clothes, I tied the laces of my black converse extra tight today. I glimpsed over at the mirror on my wall fixing a few strands of my hair pulling them behind my ears. My pale skin and brown eyes stared back at me. I checked the time on my phone and cursed, grabbing my backpack. It had my Canon, a few rolls of film, charger, and some notes.

**EDIT 02**  - The girl is independently wealthy and can leave whenever she wants This is in no way an attempt to force/extort physical contact from here. Please read my post in detail.

**The Story**
I posted an ad for a free room for a pretty girl. She moved in and things went extremely well and we got a long really well and started having sex. We have the same psychological damage and history and our personalities go together really well.

She is bi and was open to a threesome so I posted an ad to Fetlife. Got absolutely destroyed for being a creepy perv, I have personal image issues, it affected me deeply. When I'm hurt that badly, I pretty much always drink.

So I did. I drank until I blacked out. Apparently I flipped out on the girl saying she wasn't very caring because all these people just shit on me and she couldn't even be bothered to stick her head in and see if I was OK. I mean I know we just met but is that expecting too much? Just to stop in and see if I'm OK? Anyway, it ended with me kicking her out saying she was mean and cold and just made me feel worse because she didn't care. Or so I'm told, I don't remember any of this.

I woke up the next day and remembered nothing. She was gone, half her stuff was still here. It looked like she left in a hurry. I just assumed she had decided I was a creep or something and left. I can get pretty dark when I medicate being triggered with alcohol.

I felt terrible. I had no idea what had happened. I remembered nothing except that I started drinking early that day because I hurt so bad. She eventually shows up and we talk and she seems OK. I am actually shocked and in disbelief. In a bout of drunkenness, I said who-knows-what to this woman and she is back, and she doesn't seem even remotely phased by what happened. She spent the night in her car. I am utterly astounded by this reaction. I mean that, in the most literally sense, I could not believe that she was not at least a little mad about what I put her through. It was beyond comprehension. She said it was because I ""was a good person"".

So after a couple days I realize she doesn't like to touch me anymore. Whenever I touch her she pulls away. If I try to hug her she breaks the hug. Whenever she crawled into bed, she would always make it a point to touch me, even with a toe, which she stopped doing. She would always fall asleep in my arms. I am not super surprised after what I did; I didn't expect everything to go back to normal after 1 night. I can't imagine I am the most favorite person int he world to her at the moment.

After a few days, in the least threatening way I can possibly muster using the most gentle words and tone of voice I can think of, I tell her that when she does that, it hurts. It's a trigger and I'm already triggered by what happened on Fetlife and it's making everything so much harder. I told her, again without threat and in the gentlest tone, that I have limits. I can only take so many of those punches before I won't be able to handle it anymore and if we get to that point, she will have to move. I made sure to be clear that I did not want that, and to make sure she knows she will not just be kicked out into the cold, she will have time to save money etc to get out in as safe and comfortable a manner as possible (I am not a c**t), but she can't continue to live here because she'll just remind me of how repulsive she thinks I am; I can't handle that. I fight those demons every day; I can't live with someone who gives them ammo.

A couple days pass and things are greatly improved. She is touching me again and not recoiling. I don't expect things to be perfect but at least this this part isn't making it 300x harder to process all the other stuff and work through that.

Then she goes back to being the same way. Not really touching me. Pulling away. I try to talk to her but I don't ever get anything but (what strike me as) excuses and lies, not the truth about what's going on.

One night I suggest a remote-controlled vibrator as a way to maybe spice things up again. She says ""well why don't we have sex instead"". So we did. She gave me an HJ that screamed ""when will this be over already"". The look on her face made me feel disgusting and repulsive, and as such I couldn't get hard. I played nice and smiled and blamed it on an ADHD medicine I take that can caused ED. So she asks me if its OK if she gets off. I'm hurt and I feel disgusting and would much prefer maybe if she did something that make me feel like she wanted me to be in the same room with her, but I don't want to make it weird so again I smile and say ""sure"" and hand her the toy and she gets herself off, then hands me back the toy to be put away. She says something about ""better luck next time"" and then rolls over and goes to sleep. I am left feeling utterly worthless and disgusting and emasculated (because I couldn't get hard).

Last night I went to bed with her and put my foot on hers and she turned over on her side into a little ball and stayed in a little corner of the bed. That one hurt really, really bad. So I got pissed, and yelled that if she does not ship off to the Marines on 1/2 as planned she will have 30 days after that to find some place else to live. I grabbed blankets and pillows and went and slept in the living room.

This morning I spoke to her and apologized for yelling what I did through the door last night and wanted to try again while I'm calmer. Again, in the plainest, gentlest language possible I told her the problem; that when she pulls away from me it hurts a lot. I told her I did the best job I could explaining to her how much it hurt and I apologized if I did a poor job explaining it. I told her I do not want her to move, that I do enjoy her company, and I want things to continue but I cannot continue with the way things are. I don't even touch her any more because I can't handle it when she draws away from me. And now when she touches me, I feel like it's pity or something and not affection or desire. I told her if she wants to stay that's the problem that needs to be fixed - she doesn't have to touch me if she doesn't want to but she has to stop making me feel repulsive.

I have no idea what to do. It's likely this relationship is destroyed. I take responsibility for it, I know what happens when I get triggered and then drink but I was so hurt by what the people on Fetlife said to me I wasn't thinking. I don't know what to do. I really like her and she says she likes me, but her body language says she can't stand me and thinks I'm slime.

Please help.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 01&lt;/strong&gt; - I&amp;#39;m aware I&amp;#39;m an ass. You don&amp;#39;t have to downvote my post. How about maybe giving some advice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 02&lt;/strong&gt;  - The girl is independently wealthy and can leave whenever she wants This is in no way an attempt to force/extort physical contact from here. Please read my post in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Story&lt;/strong&gt;
I posted an ad for a free room for a pretty girl. She moved in and things went extremely well and we got a long really well and started having sex. We have the same psychological damage and history and our personalities go together really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is bi and was open to a threesome so I posted an ad to Fetlife. Got absolutely destroyed for being a creepy perv, I have personal image issues, it affected me deeply. When I&amp;#39;m hurt that badly, I pretty much always drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did. I drank until I blacked out. Apparently I flipped out on the girl saying she wasn&amp;#39;t very caring because all these people just shit on me and she couldn&amp;#39;t even be bothered to stick her head in and see if I was OK. I mean I know we just met but is that expecting too much? Just to stop in and see if I&amp;#39;m OK? Anyway, it ended with me kicking her out saying she was mean and cold and just made me feel worse because she didn&amp;#39;t care. Or so I&amp;#39;m told, I don&amp;#39;t remember any of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up the next day and remembered nothing. She was gone, half her stuff was still here. It looked like she left in a hurry. I just assumed she had decided I was a creep or something and left. I can get pretty dark when I medicate being triggered with alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt terrible. I had no idea what had happened. I remembered nothing except that I started drinking early that day because I hurt so bad. She eventually shows up and we talk and she seems OK. I am actually shocked and in disbelief. In a bout of drunkenness, I said who-knows-what to this woman and she is back, and she doesn&amp;#39;t seem even remotely phased by what happened. She spent the night in her car. I am utterly astounded by this reaction. I mean that, in the most literally sense, I could not believe that she was not at least a little mad about what I put her through. It was beyond comprehension. She said it was because I &amp;quot;was a good person&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after a couple days I realize she doesn&amp;#39;t like to touch me anymore. Whenever I touch her she pulls away. If I try to hug her she breaks the hug. Whenever she crawled into bed, she would always make it a point to touch me, even with a toe, which she stopped doing. She would always fall asleep in my arms. I am not super surprised after what I did; I didn&amp;#39;t expect everything to go back to normal after 1 night. I can&amp;#39;t imagine I am the most favorite person int he world to her at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few days, in the least threatening way I can possibly muster using the most gentle words and tone of voice I can think of, I tell her that when she does that, it hurts. It&amp;#39;s a trigger and I&amp;#39;m already triggered by what happened on Fetlife and it&amp;#39;s making everything so much harder. I told her, again without threat and in the gentlest tone, that I have limits. I can only take so many of those punches before I won&amp;#39;t be able to handle it anymore and if we get to that point, she will have to move. I made sure to be clear that I did not want that, and to make sure she knows she will not just be kicked out into the cold, she will have time to save money etc to get out in as safe and comfortable a manner as possible (I am not a c**t), but she can&amp;#39;t continue to live here because she&amp;#39;ll just remind me of how repulsive she thinks I am; I can&amp;#39;t handle that. I fight those demons every day; I can&amp;#39;t live with someone who gives them ammo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple days pass and things are greatly improved. She is touching me again and not recoiling. I don&amp;#39;t expect things to be perfect but at least this this part isn&amp;#39;t making it 300x harder to process all the other stuff and work through that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then she goes back to being the same way. Not really touching me. Pulling away. I try to talk to her but I don&amp;#39;t ever get anything but (what strike me as) excuses and lies, not the truth about what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night I suggest a remote-controlled vibrator as a way to maybe spice things up again. She says &amp;quot;well why don&amp;#39;t we have sex instead&amp;quot;. So we did. She gave me an HJ that screamed &amp;quot;when will this be over already&amp;quot;. The look on her face made me feel disgusting and repulsive, and as such I couldn&amp;#39;t get hard. I played nice and smiled and blamed it on an ADHD medicine I take that can caused ED. So she asks me if its OK if she gets off. I&amp;#39;m hurt and I feel disgusting and would much prefer maybe if she did something that make me feel like she wanted me to be in the same room with her, but I don&amp;#39;t want to make it weird so again I smile and say &amp;quot;sure&amp;quot; and hand her the toy and she gets herself off, then hands me back the toy to be put away. She says something about &amp;quot;better luck next time&amp;quot; and then rolls over and goes to sleep. I am left feeling utterly worthless and disgusting and emasculated (because I couldn&amp;#39;t get hard).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I went to bed with her and put my foot on hers and she turned over on her side into a little ball and stayed in a little corner of the bed. That one hurt really, really bad. So I got pissed, and yelled that if she does not ship off to the Marines on 1/2 as planned she will have 30 days after that to find some place else to live. I grabbed blankets and pillows and went and slept in the living room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning I spoke to her and apologized for yelling what I did through the door last night and wanted to try again while I&amp;#39;m calmer. Again, in the plainest, gentlest language possible I told her the problem; that when she pulls away from me it hurts a lot. I told her I did the best job I could explaining to her how much it hurt and I apologized if I did a poor job explaining it. I told her I do not want her to move, that I do enjoy her company, and I want things to continue but I cannot continue with the way things are. I don&amp;#39;t even touch her any more because I can&amp;#39;t handle it when she draws away from me. And now when she touches me, I feel like it&amp;#39;s pity or something and not affection or desire. I told her if she wants to stay that&amp;#39;s the problem that needs to be fixed - she doesn&amp;#39;t have to touch me if she doesn&amp;#39;t want to but she has to stop making me feel repulsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what to do. It&amp;#39;s likely this relationship is destroyed. I take responsibility for it, I know what happens when I get triggered and then drink but I was so hurt by what the people on Fetlife said to me I wasn&amp;#39;t thinking. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I really like her and she says she likes me, but her body language says she can&amp;#39;t stand me and thinks I&amp;#39;m slime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please help.&lt;/p&gt;

Then my friend goes to get something, and she swims really fast and grabs me from behind and tightly clings on to my back with her legs wrapped around mine and her arms tight around my chest. She puts her head down on my shoulder and says &amp;quot;Start swimming.&amp;quot; So I do, and then my friends come and he thinks were just messing about so he gets on. Then he lets go and bomb into the pool a few times while she is still clinging on to me. She then starts moving her feet up my thighs and nearly touching my p***s. So I quickly shift her legs back down. When I told her to let go she let go but quickly grabbed back onto me. She was wearing a bikini so I felt her boobs pressing against my back. But after a while she came onto my front and pressed up hard. Then we just got out of the pool. She kept talking a lot with me too afterwards. She also kept insisting that I get on her back while we were swimming. She kept pulling my hand to get on her.&lt;/p&gt;

Ive been through alot of things in my life; from being a stupid teenager doing drugs that would corrupt whom I was as a person, to making poor life decisions that lead to a health decline, my fathers passing to going through different girlfriends with betrayals, cheating, lying etc. I even thought I had felt love for the first time with the woman I lost my virginity with which was only 4 years ago.

First I met her brother and we ended up being great friends. One night she came out and when I seen her my heart stopped. All my problems went away; my depression, my low feeling in life because of where I was, the world around me froze and I looked into her deep beautiful eyes and was instantly locked. I knew. I knew this is the woman I am suppose to be with. She is so loving, caring, affectionate, made me feel good, smart, and absolutely amazingly beautiful in my eyes. This was the woman I had cried looking for in my dreams, this was the woman that had my heart in such a tight grasp that my heart burst. I got the chance to go out with her and her brother on her 25th birthday which I did. Out of everyone she asked me if I would dance with her. So I did. After that night it was a snowball of love until we broke up the first time. We got back together pledging things would be better. Things were better, and only improving. Yet I made a few mistakes and got a bit stale so we ended up drifting apart again. I know I messed up. But ive realized now what I did. I wasnt being a man and standing up to change like I should. I was content working at Mcdonalds making shit money and living with my mom. After this breakup and my recent fathers passing I thought nothing in this world could detour me anymore, when I was wrong. Not even 2 weeks after this I got fired from Mcdonalds. Im trying my hardest to apply for jobs now opening my experience. I want to learn new things. I want to get into school, I want to get into the gym, I want to become successful. But with all this; theres one thing. I love her so much I want her to be there with me through it. She is my bestfriend even now...even though we dont talk. Which is my accord because im so in love with her it would be hard to be friends. I guess where im going with this guys. I just wish she would understand the things I'd do for her. Anything. I wish I could have her back. Everyone says well maybe shes not the one. Youre wrong. Shes the one. I just think I met her at the wrong time. I'm in love with this woman and I cant love anyone else even if I wanted to. I tried. We have and had a great relationship us breaking up is because I got lazy. How do people deal with the way I feel and not want to hurt themselves? Im at the lowest point in my life and I just want her so that I can feel high again. I miss and love you so much Carmen. I hope you realize someday how much you mean to me.

I stared into the distance seeing familiar stores pass, yet thinking why I couldn’t see her as often. “Yo” my friend David snapped his fingers at my face, it was already his stop. I dapped his hand and he wrapped his arm around Amy’s waist. “see you around man, and good luck with Jacey”. He winked and left with Amy as I plugged my earbuds back in thinking about my situation. I was getting a bit tired of seeing other couples being in love as I couldn’t even indulge in my own and yet continued declaring I was in love. It was a couple of months back when I was invited to David’s party, we had been friends for a while and had grown close to become brothers. There was no way I wouldn’t accept and celebrate with him, although I found unexpected guests at his party. An unfamiliar group crowded around the backyard while my schoolmates lounged in the living room. However my mind wasn’t on that, first I immediately headed towards the drinks. “Oh Vodka and rum this time not bad” during my high school years I had become somewhat a drinker, and it was one of the top reasons I came to celebrate. I mixed myself some Vodka with orange juice and settled in the living room, mingling around with familiar faces. I turned to my friend AJ “Yo what’s up with the group down at the back”? He turned to see, and came back to reply “Oh their David’s elementary friends, apparently everyone in his elementary was tight so they got invited too”. “Say word” I saw in that small group a few girls, and they were pretty good on my scale especially one that I had my eye on. I turned back to AJ “Where’s the food man”. “At the back big boy”. “say less, Ima fill myself up right now ”. I headed towards the backyard downing more of my cup. Confidence took place of my usual dead attitude, and I focused on my newfound mission. As I entered the backyard I made small eye contact and continued to help myself to food. AJ settled to my left “Eyeing some sweeties?”. “You know me well”. I continued the idle chatter with AJ and simply placed bets that their group would eventually move onto the same table. My bet paid off as 5 minutes later we had a full table of unfamiliar faces. A girl to my left broke the ice “So how much did you drink Aaron”. It was Alexis, a familiar face. “I’ll have you know I’m still quite sober, by the way how do you know these guys?”. She shook her head “I came from the same elementary as David, so we are all elementary friends here idiot”. Well that was new, I didn’t know they came from the same elementary. But my attention started focusing heavily onto the girl in the middle, an unfamiliar face and yet… I had a feeling I knew who she was. She was pretty, with her makeup done properly and yet showing her naturally tanned skin. A Filipino for sure. As I started up conversation and slightly showed more interest towards her, I learned her name was Jacey. And by the end of the night and few more drinks I had her contact information saved onto my phone. Casual talks on Snapchat turned to flirting and it was made clear we were interested. Funny enough I realized why I found her to be familiar as David had been trying to set me up with a girl from his elementary last year, and she was the same girl. We never got to it last year, so we barely knew each other. Fast forward some more and now we were in a relationship. The only problem? Distance. She lived quite a distance and being a high school student, driving was out of the option. It was true I was somewhat lazy in my efforts to visit, but the bigger problem was that both of us were busy on days we were free, as I had extracurricular music classes and she worked 2 jobs as well as was involved with school clubs. Going to different schools meant we never saw each other until we arranged it, and our only form of communication were through our phones. We were never really talkers so we wouldn’t call, instead we asked each other about our days through snapchat and checked up on one another when we could. However, I still remembered the few times we met, and they burned in my head. The classic cheesy memories that I strived for with tinged bits of romance. The art show last week was good I thought, but she was best piece that I saw that night. I had somehow gotten the nerve to pullout roses and officialise us. I asked in a rather cryptic  way , and thought that a second attempt may be in order to properly convey my feelings. However my feelings flickered as the touch I experienced that day simply made me yearn for more, and yet they would not be satisfied until the next date. The distance had me reconsidering what I was getting into, and whether the feelings I held onto were worth fighting for. In honesty I didn’t even completely know this girl and simply held my belief in her genuineness and hardworking attitude. I was scared, as this would be the first time I was holding a true relationship instead of all the half assed affairs I held in my past. “So tonight you should go and take a chance with her, She could be everything you wanted. Everything you wanted. Don’t let that get away, Don’t let that slip away, Don’t let that love escape”. The chorus rang into my ears once more, and my smile to those lines solidified my feelings that this would be worth it.

I was scared, as this would be the first time I was holding a true relationship instead of all the half assed affairs I held in my past. “So tonight you should go and take a chance with her, She could be everything you wanted. Everything you wanted. Don’t let that get away, Don’t let that slip away, Don’t let that love escape”. The chorus rang into my ears once more, and my smile to those lines solidified my feelings that this would be worth it. I couldn’t let someone so perfect get away over some small doubts could I?&lt;/p&gt;

It started in the fifth grade.
My friend Mila and I decided to go to the beach together. I thought we were going to be going to the nearby public each but instead we went to her cousin's private community beach. A fifth grade boy our age kept on talking to her at the beach I was like ""EXCUSE ME DO I KNOW YOU SHE'S MY FRIEND NOT YOURS."" Turns out that boy was her cousin, Rohan. (Of course I didn't know that though) So I hated Rohan and he hated me back for a while, because we each thought we were being ""replaced"" by the other. As the years went by I forgot about the boy at the beach. And then, I met him again at her Chinese New Year family party in the eighth grade. We were both taller than when we had been, but he was a little bit taller than me. I talked to him and Mila the whole time, and we laughed, and ate and watch videos together. A month or so after that day, Mila asked me during a sleepover.
""Do you like Rohan?"" 
I hadn't really thought about it. The fact that I liked him. I mean, yeah, I liked him as a friend, but as a..... love interest? There was a part of me that was confused, but there was also a part of me that screamed yes. So, foolishly, I decided to listen to that one part of me screaming yes. 
""Yeah"" I simply replied, and before I fell asleep I heard her voice say, ""I support you""

____________________________________________________________ SOME TIME LATER ______________________________ 
Rohan was going to have a graduation bonfire at the beach. And I was invited. At this point, I was hopelessly in love, and so I decided, HECK I'M GOING TO CONFESS TO HIM. I texted Mila right away, and of course she dared me that I wouldn't. Even though I knew deep inside that I probably wouldn't, I decided to tell her I would. We worked on the confession for a month, planning everything so that it was perfect. The plan was a stupid one, looking back, but it was a plan nevertheless. The plan was this: Mila would announce that she had to go to the bathroom, and everyone would go with her and that would be the time for me to confess. (OH GOD) The confession was to be about 8:00. The day of the bonfire, I was feeling pumped. I was ready. I could do this. I was a strong-willed person. However, when we arrived to the beach at 4:30, I could already feel the sinking dread of what I had signed up for. As the time rolled by, I checked my phone. It was 7:30, I had 30 more minutes to go.
""I'm going to go to the bathroom.""
WHAT. THE. FUCK. (there goes my 30 minutes)
I said in a small voice, 
""Yeah me too.""
Mila turned toward me and said through a gritted smile, 
""YOU ARE STAYING RIGHT HERE DON'T FUCK THIS UP.""
*ahhh true friendship*
And so, I sat on the bench near the bonfire as I watched my friends recede into the distance. I watched as my friends disappeared and Rohan walked over to sit next to me. 
My heart was like TIME TO CONFESS. My brain however, had forgotten every single word I was going to say. I sat there next to him, trying to think of something to say, and then.
""You know, the first time I met you, I thought you were really weird."" Rohan spoke as he looked out at the bonfire, the flickering flames reflected in his eyes. WHAAAAAAT IS HAPPENING. My brain shut down as I sat there, barely processing what he said, until I heard the six words that would change my life.
""You know I like you Natalie?""
I leaned my head onto his shoulder and closed my eyes, and spoke  softly.
""I love you too Rohan.""

   Laila walked up to the man and slapped him with all get energy. This action left the man in shock and with a large cut bleeding on his cheek. He snapped his head to glare at her.  
 
   ""I want my stuff back creep. You messed with the wrong girl, old man."" Laila exclaimed as she uneasily moved from side to side, waiting for the man's response to her righteousness. 

   To her surprise, the man began to laugh uncontrollably. Laila was now completely puzzled and her expression showed it. 

   ""Wha-"" she began but was interrupted by a heavy hand smashing her face into the nearby brick wall. 
 
   As she tried to regain some composer, she took two fingers and felt her head as a gush of red liquid ran down her face. A look at her fingers confirmed she was bleeding; a lot. She licked her lips to taste more blood. Turning around once again led to another head throbbing punch into the pavement making her vision blur and her ears begin to ring. Laila's eyes became heavy and her body felt weak as she gathered enough strength to attempt an escape from the old man.   

   She crawled backwards towards the opening of the alley as fast as her feet and hands would move. Moving her head and body from side to side avoiding as many of the man's swings as possible. One specific blow to the stomach left her frozen and clutching her gut, as she felt she had broken some ribs. The man's breathing became exasperated and tired as he slowed down his pace and his punches became more aimless. With a horse and shaky voice, Laila called out for the man to stop. He ignored the plead and continued to throw his arms at her. She took a deep breath and screamed as loud as she could, startling the man. This gave her enough time to grab a nearby rock and chuck it at the old man. She didn't look back to see if it had hit him as her blood covered fingers grasped her phen lying a few feet away. She struggled to get to her feet but even when she did the pain in her gut overwhelmed her. She limped toward the opening, stumbling, as her eyes could not focus on a single set point and became heavier then before. 
 
   As she ran out, she didnt notice a man walking down the street and walked right into him. Laila stepped back, scared and startled, she kept her head down. The man's hand caught her and the touch made her jump a bit. The man looked at the person he'd bumped into and his eyes became wide. 

   ""Laila, what- what happened to you?"" Marcus's beautiful accent touched her ears and she abruptly looked up. 
 
   Her eyes became wide and she turned around to an empty area that once held the dirty old man. She again turned to Marcus and put her head back down to look at the ground.

   ""Nothing."" she tried to tell him, bit no sound came out.

   Eyes wide, her hand shot to her throat and her eyebrows came together in a concerned manner. She tried to utter a word- any word but failed to. Seeing Laila clearly in distress and hurt he asked her again, what had happened. Laila shook her head and frowned. 

   ""Alright, well we need to get you to a hospital. You need medical attention,"" calmly told her, putting his hand on her shoulder. 

  He put his hands around her shoulders and attempter to help her walk, making her clutch her stomach tighter.

  ""I'm sorry, I'm going to just carry you, okay? The hospital is only 3 blocks away from here."" Marcus told her. 

   Just like that, he pit his arm under Laila's shaking legs and swept her up. She gladly  wrapped her arms around his neck and rested her head on his strong shoulder.  Marcus began to walk as Laila felt herself beginning to doze off. 

   ""No."" Marcus began. ""Laila, you have to stay awake. Of you have a concussion, you have to stay awake okay? Its just 10 minutes, 15 tops. Just stay with me until then, alright?"" 

   She looked at him, even though her vision was still blurry, she looked right into his eyes and could tell he was genuinely concerned. So she nodded and took a deep breath looking forward. 

   ""This is not going to be over anytime soon,"" she thought. She wasn't wrong; not by a long shot.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I want my stuff back creep. You messed with the wrong girl, old man.&amp;quot; Laila exclaimed as she uneasily moved from side to side, waiting for the man&amp;#39;s response to her righteousness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To her surprise, the man began to laugh uncontrollably. Laila was now completely puzzled and her expression showed it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wha-&amp;quot; she began but was interrupted by a heavy hand smashing her face into the nearby brick wall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As she tried to regain some composer, she took two fingers and felt her head as a gush of red liquid ran down her face. A look at her fingers confirmed she was bleeding; a lot. She licked her lips to taste more blood. Turning around once again led to another head throbbing punch into the pavement making her vision blur and her ears begin to ring. Laila&amp;#39;s eyes became heavy and her body felt weak as she gathered enough strength to attempt an escape from the old man.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She crawled backwards towards the opening of the alley as fast as her feet and hands would move. Moving her head and body from side to side avoiding as many of the man&amp;#39;s swings as possible. One specific blow to the stomach left her frozen and clutching her gut, as she felt she had broken some ribs. The man&amp;#39;s breathing became exasperated and tired as he slowed down his pace and his punches became more aimless. With a horse and shaky voice, Laila called out for the man to stop. He ignored the plead and continued to throw his arms at her. She took a deep breath and screamed as loud as she could, startling the man. This gave her enough time to grab a nearby rock and chuck it at the old man. She didn&amp;#39;t look back to see if it had hit him as her blood covered fingers grasped her phen lying a few feet away. She struggled to get to her feet but even when she did the pain in her gut overwhelmed her. She limped toward the opening, stumbling, as her eyes could not focus on a single set point and became heavier then before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As she ran out, she didnt notice a man walking down the street and walked right into him. Laila stepped back, scared and startled, she kept her head down. The man&amp;#39;s hand caught her and the touch made her jump a bit. The man looked at the person he&amp;#39;d bumped into and his eyes became wide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Laila, what- what happened to you?&amp;quot; Marcus&amp;#39;s beautiful accent touched her ears and she abruptly looked up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her eyes became wide and she turned around to an empty area that once held the dirty old man. She again turned to Marcus and put her head back down to look at the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nothing.&amp;quot; she tried to tell him, bit no sound came out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eyes wide, her hand shot to her throat and her eyebrows came together in a concerned manner. She tried to utter a word- any word but failed to. Seeing Laila clearly in distress and hurt he asked her again, what had happened. Laila shook her head and frowned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alright, well we need to get you to a hospital. You need medical attention,&amp;quot; calmly told her, putting his hand on her shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He put his hands around her shoulders and attempter to help her walk, making her clutch her stomach tighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, I&amp;#39;m going to just carry you, okay? The hospital is only 3 blocks away from here.&amp;quot; Marcus told her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like that, he pit his arm under Laila&amp;#39;s shaking legs and swept her up. She gladly  wrapped her arms around his neck and rested her head on his strong shoulder.  Marcus began to walk as Laila felt herself beginning to doze off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No.&amp;quot; Marcus began. &amp;quot;Laila, you have to stay awake. Of you have a concussion, you have to stay awake okay? Its just 10 minutes, 15 tops. Just stay with me until then, alright?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She looked at him, even though her vision was still blurry, she looked right into his eyes and could tell he was genuinely concerned. So she nodded and took a deep breath looking forward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is not going to be over anytime soon,&amp;quot; she thought. She wasn&amp;#39;t wrong; not by a long shot.&lt;/p&gt;

   You see, Laila had recently been in a relationship that had ended badly and was not looking for anything new at the moment. Even though there was a strong temptation to with her recent encounter, she was determined to not let it get to her. 

   As she walked down an alleyway which was covered in overturned garbage cans and broken glass bottles, she looked down at her phone, not realizing she had walked right into a man. The man looked to be about 45 years old and had a long brown beard to match his disheveled hair which had begun to turn gray and looked as though it was fairly dirty and unkept. His baggy clothes had many holes and unsual colored stains covering the majority of his once white shirt and denim blue jeans. 

   Laila had an uneasy feeling so she kept her eyes down and mumbled an apologize. Before she had a chance to take another step, the man grabbed her arm. Laila heard a long rrriiiiiippp and looked down to see a large slash in the arm of her dress. Her mouth hung open as she looked up at the man.

   ""Someone so pretty and fancy lookin' don't have no business walkin' down here,"" he said creeping closer to her with every word. 

His breath reeked of chicken and his teeth looked rotten and chipped. 

   ""O-okay, I'll go then,"" she managed to yank her arm back as she spoke. 

   She desperately ran down the alley, trying not to fall or let the man catch up to her.

   ""Hey!"" he called out. 

   Laila did not turn around, but she could hear the loud stomps of his boots coming behind her. She tried to run quicker. Unfortunately, the heel of her right shoe gave out and she fell to the ground, dropping her purse and phone. All her belongings scattered across the pathway. Then man slowed his pace but continued to walk in her direction. He leaned down and picked up a roll of money and a pack of gum. 

   ""This should do,"" he said before getting up and walking in the other direction. 

   She should've just left it there, but she couldn't. She took off her left shoe and flung it into a near by garbage bin. 

   ""Hey creep!"" she yelled. 

   The man stopped and turned around slowly as she held her breath.

So i felt like a damsel in distress who just got saved and felt rlly grateful to this dude, lets call him paul. So then i realized paul had come up to me earlier (i was drunk earlier as well) and we were hardcore flirting, the sexual tension was off the chang, anyway i recognized him but didnt comment, i said thanks and asked him his name and whatnot and when i tried to tell him stuff about me, he just cut me off and said yeah i know you and then he told me my name and my friends name, what university im in, he said that we had a class together (i had no idea) and a bunch of other stuff, he even said he liked me, so it was kinda stalkerish and also kinda sweet.

 So i felt flattered and made out with him and people (including my friend) were watching us so i told him to go with me to the bathroom where we could make out in peace, in the bathroom things got rlly heated and he took out a condom, i said we wouldnt need it because we werent having sex, he told me he was virgin (which was surpising because hes like 21, and pretty cute), i told him youre not losing your virginity in a bathroom so he just kept on kissing me and he put me against the wall and dry humped me so i let him get to first base and then he pulled my pants down and tried to give me oral but i didnt let him, by now his pants were down as well and he kept insisting we have sex so i told him id give him a bj to get him off and i did and that was pretty much it. Afterwards he said thank you (awkward) and i told him that this had to stay between us. 

When we got out of the bathroom the party was over and we had no ride home so we got in the car with some of his friends and they were gonna take me home, one of them was rlly cute and flirted with me but i didnt rlly do anything and neither did paul. So we all went to mcdonalds and he basically acted like nothing happened and ignored me. His friend dropped him off at his house first and he got out and didnt say bye or anything. Monday in college, everyone knew that we had made out, and he told everyone we had sex when we didnt!!!!!!!!! Lo and behold, paul was really popular at my university, i didnt know it because he was older than me and was a semester ahead, but i was taking extra classes to get ahead and he was in one of them. So to my horrible luck, come monday morning everyone in the semester above knew who i was, and i had lied to my friends and told them nothing happened, but they found out and so did all the other civil engineers (if you didnt guess, i major in civil engineering and so does he). I got bullied, everyone thought i was a slut, people i didnt even know would call his name out at me whenever i walked by, and this went on for at least 2 months if not more. When people met me, theyd immediately ask, arent you the girl that hooked up with paul at that party??
 
Meanwhile, i had a class with him and the teacher put us together in a group project!! So in this project there were 3 friends of his, 1 mutual friend and the two of us. He did absolutely everything to avoid me and did nothing at all on the project!! His friends got rlly mad at him for not participating even though im guessing they knew he was avoiding me because everyone thought we had a one night stand. I ended becoming rlly good friends with them even though they didnt believe me when i told them we didnt have sex. 

So now a new semester is starting and hes now in 2 of my classes, i have no idea what to do or anything. He keeps ignoring me and i hate him for it, i dont want him to be my bf i just wish i didnt feel this horrible feelin everytime i see him. I know he hates me but i cant figure out why, i should hate him for telling everyone we had sex, and i did for a really long time, but now i dont care anymore, the bullying is over, he gave me a rlly bad reputation but at least i got kinda popular over it (im a shy girl thats never been the center of attention). Sometimes i see him and i wish we could be friends, i know i should talk to him, but i cant, he doesnt put himself in situations where he can talk to me, the douchebag hates my fucking guts. Only once was i in a situation where i could talk to him but i kept waiting for him to talk to me, to apologize, or to just say hey and act normal, but he cant even look me in the eyes, he just kept staring at his phone, so i left. I really want to get over this and put it behind since it was like 6 months ago, but i cant help it everytime i see him in class i feel hate, regret, remorse and a bit of longing. Prior to the sexual activity i thought he was perfect, i was actually into him and he was into me. Like i said i dont want him to be my boyfriend, i just want to not walk into a room and feel immediately nervouse because hes there, or feel like i have to impress him so that he can see what he missed out on. I wish i didnt care. 

Whats wrong with me? what should i do? Is he a douche? Am i a drama queen? why do i want him to liek me when i know hes a jerk?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;so heres the story (its rlly long but i think its a good one), i went to this party and everyone got super wasted to the point where this perv was trying to force me to dance with him and i kept trying to push him away, my friends kept trying to get him off me and he wouldnt let me go, so this random guy comes up and gets him off me and tells him to stop touching me and proceeds to take me outside (huzzah! my prince charming!).

So then i realized paul had come up to me earlier (i was drunk earlier as well) and we were hardcore flirting, the sexual tension was off the chang, anyway i recognized him but didnt comment, i said thanks and asked him his name and whatnot and when i tried to tell him stuff about me, he just cut me off and said yeah i know you and then he told me my name and my friends name, what university im in, he said that we had a class together (i had no idea) and a bunch of other stuff, he even said he liked me, so it was kinda stalkerish and also kinda sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So i felt flattered and made out with him and people (including my friend) were watching us so i told him to go with me to the bathroom where we could make out in peace, in the bathroom things got rlly heated and he took out a condom, i said we wouldnt need it because we werent having sex, he told me he was virgin (which was surpising because hes like 21, and pretty cute), i told him youre not losing your virginity in a bathroom so he just kept on kissing me and he put me against the wall and dry humped me so i let him get to first base and then he pulled my pants down and tried to give me oral but i didnt let him, by now his pants were down as well and he kept insisting we have sex so i told him id give him a bj to get him off and i did and that was pretty much it. Afterwards he said thank you (awkward) and i told him that this had to stay between us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got out of the bathroom the party was over and we had no ride home so we got in the car with some of his friends and they were gonna take me home, one of them was rlly cute and flirted with me but i didnt rlly do anything and neither did paul. So we all went to mcdonalds and he basically acted like nothing happened and ignored me. His friend dropped him off at his house first and he got out and didnt say bye or anything. Monday in college, everyone knew that we had made out, and he told everyone we had sex when we didnt!!!!!!!!! Lo and behold, paul was really popular at my university, i didnt know it because he was older than me and was a semester ahead, but i was taking extra classes to get ahead and he was in one of them. So to my horrible luck, come monday morning everyone in the semester above knew who i was, and i had lied to my friends and told them nothing happened, but they found out and so did all the other civil engineers (if you didnt guess, i major in civil engineering and so does he). I got bullied, everyone thought i was a slut, people i didnt even know would call his name out at me whenever i walked by, and this went on for at least 2 months if not more. When people met me, theyd immediately ask, arent you the girl that hooked up with paul at that party??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, i had a class with him and the teacher put us together in a group project!! So in this project there were 3 friends of his, 1 mutual friend and the two of us. He did absolutely everything to avoid me and did nothing at all on the project!! His friends got rlly mad at him for not participating even though im guessing they knew he was avoiding me because everyone thought we had a one night stand. I ended becoming rlly good friends with them even though they didnt believe me when i told them we didnt have sex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now a new semester is starting and hes now in 2 of my classes, i have no idea what to do or anything. He keeps ignoring me and i hate him for it, i dont want him to be my bf i just wish i didnt feel this horrible feelin everytime i see him. I know he hates me but i cant figure out why, i should hate him for telling everyone we had sex, and i did for a really long time, but now i dont care anymore, the bullying is over, he gave me a rlly bad reputation but at least i got kinda popular over it (im a shy girl thats never been the center of attention). Sometimes i see him and i wish we could be friends, i know i should talk to him, but i cant, he doesnt put himself in situations where he can talk to me, the douchebag hates my fucking guts. Only once was i in a situation where i could talk to him but i kept waiting for him to talk to me, to apologize, or to just say hey and act normal, but he cant even look me in the eyes, he just kept staring at his phone, so i left. I really want to get over this and put it behind since it was like 6 months ago, but i cant help it everytime i see him in class i feel hate, regret, remorse and a bit of longing. Prior to the sexual activity i thought he was perfect, i was actually into him and he was into me. Like i said i dont want him to be my boyfriend, i just want to not walk into a room and feel immediately nervouse because hes there, or feel like i have to impress him so that he can see what he missed out on. I wish i didnt care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whats wrong with me? what should i do? Is he a douche? Am i a drama queen? why do i want him to liek me when i know hes a jerk?&lt;/p&gt;

She looked down at her phone walking straight through the loud honks and shouts that came with living in the one and only, New York City.

   'Please, please like this one,' she thought desperately as she hit the send button. 

   As she looked up, she saw them in the distance. Putting on her best fake smile, she walked up to meet the couple in front of a large Victorian old brick house. Although, this time they were joined by another man who faced the brick house as she approached. 

   ""Hi Mr. and Mrs. Graivelle,"" she said greeting the two with a graceful handshake. 

The man finally turned around and Laila's expression slightly changed. 

   ""Wow."" she thought, her eyes wide and fixated on him. 

   Just like his deep ocean blue eyes, which were wide with surprise. The man looked to be about 28 years old, only 2 years older than she was. They continued to look at each other, his face showing hints of curiosity and hers absolutely in awe. Just as the staring began to go on for a bit too long, Mrs. Graivelle cleared her throat loudly and gave each of them a stern look. 

   ""Miss Moon, this is our nephew, Marcus he is going to view the house with us today."" Her frown deepening as she spoke. 

   ""Of course, its nice to meet you. My name is Laila Moon, I'm your aunt and uncles' real estate agent."" She looked down, embarrassed by her unprofessional behavior. 

   She shook Marcus' hand, noticing a little zap as she felt his warm hand touch hers. Her eyes shot up at the feeling to capture his expression, it remained unchanged.

   'Stop it Laila, you're a professional,' she thought. 

   He nodded. 

   ""It's nice to meet you too, Miss Moon,"" he replied, revealing a strong Irish accent which only intrigued Laila even more.

   'Be strong!' She thought and shook any 'unprofessional' thoughts from her mind. 

   She fixed her posture and walked with the same confidence she had minutes before meeting Marcus. He followed close behind, while his aunt and uncle shared a look of disapproval at their nephew's interaction with their real estate agent.

A few weeks into summer I invited her to coffee. We went out to coffee, but it proceeded to turn into a longer evening together. On the retreat she mentioned she had never paddled boarded but always wanted to go. So I took her paddle boarding. Then we walked around all night. It was special for at least me. 

A few weeks later (this Monday) I invited her on a picnic. I told her don't bring anything except dessert if she wants to bring something, because I wanted to plan the whole thing. She loves books and roses. So, I setup the whole picnic speakers, food, and in the middle of the blanket was my favorite book with a rose in it. Again we talked all night and it was literally the perfect night to me. Before she left we kissed and I gave her the bouquet of of roses.

Wednesday was her friends birthday. Her friend wanted to go to the bar that I always go to on Wednesday so we planned to meet up there. Which we did. Once I met her I told her she forgot a few things at the picnic the other day. So we walked to my car holding holding hands. Once we got to my car we made out for about an hour or 2. 

The next day we talked on the phone for like 3 hours. While talking on the phone she told me that she still had feelings for her ex. But also told me that her ex didn't think good morning text mattered, and that no one had ever took her on a picnic like I did. The next morning proceeded to send her a good morning text.

Friday she invited me over to her house. I met majority of her family. All of them greeted me by name and seemed pretty excited to meet me. Her brother in law took me to the side and gave me ""the tough guy talk"" and he told me that she likes me. I stayed until 4am. We walked around her neighborhood holding hands, kissed, snuggled together under the stars, and she fell asleep in my arms. That same night she told me she thinks I'm too good for her.

Saturday and Sunday, barely any talking/texting and invited her to dinner and she replied with an ""I don't know.""

I'm so lost guys. I genuinely think I love this girl. I think about her all day and night. I try my hardest to not flood her with text. I am completely head over heels for this girl. But I don't understand what's happening? I need help and advice. Am I pressing too hard?

This was the title that peeked the interest of my late husband almost 7 years ago. I couldn't tell you what I wrote in the body of that rant/rave, but whatever it was led to a first date and we were glued together from then until the day he passed.

Craigslist has gone downhill rapidly since then (it wasn't exactly a pillar of the community at that time), but on what would have been our 5th anniversary, I felt it cathartic symmetry to post here. (The copious amounts of alcohol I have consumed had nothing to do with this decision.)

My husband was unique and irreplaceable. Our love story defied the odds in epic ways. His death was long and ugly (FUCK cancer), but his heart goes on.

just for us
right for us
best for us
only for us

I love the life we've made.

Happy Anniversary to the one who has my heart.

Those are the words on the last anniversary card I will ever receive. I have no idea when he bought it as planning ahead for things like that wasn't his forte, but he had it hidden well in a place I would never look. He hadn't signed it, but he had bought it.

So, for those brave, drunk or bored enough to read this, if you have someone who has your heart, hold them tight. Love them like you're going to lose them because the fact is that none of us know when we will go. He never thought he would lose the battle. The doctors gave him 2-4 months, he made it 2 weeks. He didn't even know where he was at the end. You think you know how things will play out, but none of us do.

Hold him tight, always kiss her goodnight, orgasms get rid of headaches. Never go to sleep angry, always kiss each other goodbye, be the first to say your sorry. Put each other first and you will know a happiness beyond your wildest dreams.

Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow that I shall say good night till it be morrow.

In a house that looked more like a cabin in the woods than a cottage in the small town, Gale was about to close the windows of his small pharmacy that overlooked the carriage paved cobbled street. He flipped over the open sign to his “Hulder Herbology.” His neighbors were also closing their shops and market stalls, while people who came from a remoter part of the country side prepared to dump their home-grown produce or other commodities back in their wagon. They would have to cross the Rotun hill before it gets really dark and God knows what fairies or changelings will come out. Gale quietly waited for the mandarine orange sky overlooking the humble town of Fullgreens to be peppered with indigo blue specks of the dark, eyeing the ghost of a moon in the baby blue.

Gale finally shut the windows and turned around to see the back of his assistant who made absolutely no noise as she put back the dry herbs to their own small designated cupboards and cleaned their little rustic laboratory.



In contrast with Gale who was taller then average farmers who lived in the stretch from New Jersey to the south of Virginia, his assistant was a tiny, petite woman who looked no older than twenty. She wore a grey cap over her black hair that was styled into a modest, if seen in negative light–prudish, old fashioned bun that Gale has no idea how she tied into without those lacy nets that are all the rage. When she finally turned around to catch her superior looking at her, her dark eyes stared back with their characteristic alertness.

Ever the observant scholar, Gale was puzzled. They’ve lived and worked in his pharmacy that was also his home for about a week now, but he could never fathom any kind of meaning in her translucent eyes.

He can never gauge his alien-looking assistant’s intentions when she stares at him with such a pure of an expression, her glassy stare. She was not a hostile creature ever, as she is a bunny rabbit who he turned human in exchange for her services, but her bold pinning stare hardly won her a reputation as a proper lady. But Gale mused,

‘But the truth is that rabbits’ faces never ever change. So Michaela’s demeanor must have simply transferred to her human state.’

It was only after Gale stopped musing over Michaela’s deep chasms of ink that he began to see her round, smooth contour of her face, pink pert mouth, and honey-beige skin the townspeople called “mustard dyed” or “spun oat meal”.

I'm in a situation where I met the most beautiful woman I've ever laid eyes on. We graduated from the same university and were just hanging out in town until we both found careers. 

We met on tinder and had some amazing nights out before I had to leave for a week for work and a job interview. Before I left she texted me things like ""Why didn't I meet you a long time ago?"" and in person, told me to hurry back. 

Well, I got that job from the interview (very excited) and will be positioned in Harrisburg (Pennsylvania's capital, small city, not what this girl who grew up in Las Vegas would consider exciting). 

She's already planned to move back home (Vegas) at the end of the month until she finds a job in a place she'll enjoy. 

I see her every once in a while for a pool day or to bring her dinner before she goes to work but she seems to be distancing herself to avoid being hurt. 

I really want her to come with me, but am struggling because if I ask, I may just scare her away forever. 

I lose sleep when she doesn't text me back. I've cut ties with every other girl I used to hook up with before I met her. I would give everything I own just to be able to call her mine. 

How do I go about asking this girl to move to a place I know she won't enjoy for a guy she's only been seeing a few weeks?

Perhaps it's because they actually can't think of exactly what to do. With a hectic work schedule, family engagements and a busy lifestyle those of us often put it on the back burner. "" She knows I love her.. RIght? "" "" He appreciates what I do for him."" Here are ten ""acts of love"" that you can do with and for your partner to bring a little more romance into your relationship. Not only will this help the bond between you stronger, but It will also show your partner that you are there for the long haul.  
 
1. Make your mornings special by bringing your partner a cup of coffee while he or she is still in bed. If you have time to splurge breakfast in bed is always a pick me up aswell.  It will make your partner feel cherished and the kindness will be returned. 
2. Make time to spend together. Don’t let work and a busy life keep you from spending quality time with your partner. Try planning a romantic rendezvous during the week. Just the anticipation of being together will add spark to your romantic life. 
3. Before you leave in the morning tell your partner that you are looking forward to seeing them when you return. Never leave the house without acknowledging your partner or saying, ""I love you."" This also goes for evenings aswell, never go to bed Angry or without telling your partner how much they mean to you.  
4. If your partner is having a Rough day, try a night out. Pick a low key restaurant and spend time to unwind. Give them the opportunity to relax and feel pampered knowing that you are there for them through the good and the bad. 
5. Whenever you can, take the time to give your partner 100% of your attention when they want to talk to you. Remove all distractions, sit and listen without commenting. Let your partner know that you hear what they are saying and wait for them to finish to reply. Your partner may not need you to Fix a problem, they just want someone to listen to them. 
6. Be spontaneous, hire a babysitter and make a weekend trip to a park. Rent a hotel room and spend time together with no other distractions. Write "" I love you "" on the mirror in the bathroom after a hot shower. The small things are the most important. Its not the money that you spend, it’s the time and effort you put in that will count. 
7. Take the time to tell your partner that they look wonderful, beautiful, sexy or great. We all have doubts about our looks and hearing that we are attractive to our partners is a very important part of creating a romantic relationship.  
8. Next time you are shopping alone, get a couple of little ""surprise gifts"" for your partner. The next time he or she is feeling down, give them one of the gifts. They don’t have to be extremely expensive.  
9. A hug and a kiss is just what the doctor ordered after a long busy day. You will both feel more deeply connected throughout the evening. Also remember to touch your partner affectionately throughout the day, not just when you want to be romantic. 
10. This one is terribly romantic, so don't try it unless you're ready for a passionate evening. Write the reasons you love your partner on Index cards and place them throughout the house. They place 2 Roses on the bed to signify the "" Present  "" and "" Future "". Let your partner read each card that shows the many ways and reasons you love the person that they are.  Your partner will never forget your thoughtfulness. 
These ideas are just a little help to get you started. Once you get going, more ideas will come to you on their own. Don’t attempt to all of them in a week. Just explore your options. People often think that once there is commitment the dating stops. Once there is marriage the romance and courting ends. This could not be farther from the truth. Continue to date your partner or spouse every day of your life. Show them that they made the right choice by choosing you and that you will never take there love for granted.

 ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building a relationship with an abundance of Romance is something everyone thinks about, but few people do. Perhaps it&amp;#39;s because they actually can&amp;#39;t think of exactly what to do. With a hectic work schedule, family engagements and a busy lifestyle those of us often put it on the back burner. &amp;quot; She knows I love her.. RIght? &amp;quot; &amp;quot; He appreciates what I do for him.&amp;quot; Here are ten &amp;quot;acts of love&amp;quot; that you can do with and for your partner to bring a little more romance into your relationship. Not only will this help the bond between you stronger, but It will also show your partner that you are there for the long haul.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your mornings special by bringing your partner a cup of coffee while he or she is still in bed. If you have time to splurge breakfast in bed is always a pick me up aswell.  It will make your partner feel cherished and the kindness will be returned. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make time to spend together. Don’t let work and a busy life keep you from spending quality time with your partner. Try planning a romantic rendezvous during the week. Just the anticipation of being together will add spark to your romantic life. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before you leave in the morning tell your partner that you are looking forward to seeing them when you return. Never leave the house without acknowledging your partner or saying, &amp;quot;I love you.&amp;quot; This also goes for evenings aswell, never go to bed Angry or without telling your partner how much they mean to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your partner is having a Rough day, try a night out. Pick a low key restaurant and spend time to unwind. Give them the opportunity to relax and feel pampered knowing that you are there for them through the good and the bad. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever you can, take the time to give your partner 100% of your attention when they want to talk to you. Remove all distractions, sit and listen without commenting. Let your partner know that you hear what they are saying and wait for them to finish to reply. Your partner may not need you to Fix a problem, they just want someone to listen to them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be spontaneous, hire a babysitter and make a weekend trip to a park. Rent a hotel room and spend time together with no other distractions. Write &amp;quot; I love you &amp;quot; on the mirror in the bathroom after a hot shower. The small things are the most important. Its not the money that you spend, it’s the time and effort you put in that will count. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take the time to tell your partner that they look wonderful, beautiful, sexy or great. We all have doubts about our looks and hearing that we are attractive to our partners is a very important part of creating a romantic relationship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next time you are shopping alone, get a couple of little &amp;quot;surprise gifts&amp;quot; for your partner. The next time he or she is feeling down, give them one of the gifts. They don’t have to be extremely expensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hug and a kiss is just what the doctor ordered after a long busy day. You will both feel more deeply connected throughout the evening. Also remember to touch your partner affectionately throughout the day, not just when you want to be romantic. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This one is terribly romantic, so don&amp;#39;t try it unless you&amp;#39;re ready for a passionate evening. Write the reasons you love your partner on Index cards and place them throughout the house. They place 2 Roses on the bed to signify the &amp;quot; Present  &amp;quot; and &amp;quot; Future &amp;quot;. Let your partner read each card that shows the many ways and reasons you love the person that they are.  Your partner will never forget your thoughtfulness. 
These ideas are just a little help to get you started. Once you get going, more ideas will come to you on their own. Don’t attempt to all of them in a week. Just explore your options. People often think that once there is commitment the dating stops. Once there is marriage the romance and courting ends. This could not be farther from the truth. Continue to date your partner or spouse every day of your life. Show them that they made the right choice by choosing you and that you will never take there love for granted.&lt;br/&gt;
Taking the time to create romance in your relationship is Vital. Every day should feel like the honeymoon and in 40 years you can say that your love is stronger than ever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I fell in love two years ago, exactly on December 31st 2017. Now, I am young and still feel like I have so many things to learn. I have never wanted to marry or have kids or start a family or spend the rest of my life with someone, most of it due to watching how my parents were and are ever since I was a little child. Love for me was what I saw in movies and for me it was liking someone and having your heart beat fast and for someone to think you are attractive and to kiss and hold hands. That changed for me when I fell in love for the first time but it didn't last. The guy led me on and shamed me for loving him in front of all my peers and friends and seniors. 

I wasn't even looking for love when I found HIM. I met him at New Year's Eve thing and at first, he seemed weird and unusual and to me not that far from possibly...crazy. I thought that was the last time I would see him but little did I know that I would see him again the next day and the day after and the day after and the day after. Somehow, we kept randomly bumping into each other and we started talking. Four days into it, I had become his friend and was about to leave when I was hanging out with him and our friends when our eyes met over the crowd and I swear to mother-fu\*king god, his eyes were the most gorgeous I've ever seen. I actually couldn't breathe in the moment and I still recall the moment exactly, starting with where he was and I was, what I was wearing, what he was wearing, our surroundings, etc. I'm not going to tell you it was love at first sight. It definitely wasn't. 

I just grew a crush on him.

Suddenly, I was flipping into chances to know him, to meet him, to be with him. I hung out with his friends and day by day, I got to know him better. Everything that I saw from the way he giggled instead of laughed to teasing his older brother on being shorter than him to his quiet eyes that scanned his surroundings to the way he could goof off and starting singing the Minions theme song but immediately become serious to his funny antics got me heading straight for the hills. The last straw for how I truly knew I loved him was when I saw him working day and night to achieve his dream  and nearly pass out.

I fell in love around three or four or five months into it. 

It's been two years guys. I have gotten to know him better and I have seen his flaws from his insecurities to his sometimes mean behavior to how superficial he can be to naive to being stupid to many other things that I can't say. They have ALL made me love him even more and I find myself excited, thrilled, positively beaming to find out more flaws and more secrets and more hidden stories that I find myself already holding a place in my heart to keep locked up. I fall deeper and deeper and deeper for him everyday and that love just grew bigger. He held me as I was crying, falling hard into my eating disorder and getting treatment and therapy to watching me get so angry I nearly broke everything in my house and he still held me. Guys, he stood by me when everyone left. He told me it was going to be okay, he made me feel loved and he made me smile when my parents told me to leave and how worthless I am. My sweet beautiful boy was there every single step of the way and all I pray now, all I beg of the world and God, is not to kiss him or hold his hands \[ which I also really want \] but to support him, to hold him when he is sad and be the first person he tells when he is happy, to hold his hands as he breaks and to stand by him and help him heal if he ever needs me. I want to take care of him when he is sick, give him massages when he is stressed, cheer the loudest when he accomplishes his dream, hug him after he has a bad day and so many things that I can't even begin to decipher. 

But he has a beautiful, talented, smart, nice girlfriend who can give him what he deserves.

I can't help but think he deserves an angel after seeing the boy who started bawling his eyes out when his friends were stressed and didn't get the job they wanted.

What do I do? Do I pursue him or leave him be? If I can support him and love him quietly from the sides as his best friend or even friend and if he truly loves her and she makes him happy, I will not interfere even though my heart shatters every time I think about it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the thing. I fell in love two years ago, exactly on December 31st 2017. Now, I am young and still feel like I have so many things to learn. I have never wanted to marry or have kids or start a family or spend the rest of my life with someone, most of it due to watching how my parents were and are ever since I was a little child. Love for me was what I saw in movies and for me it was liking someone and having your heart beat fast and for someone to think you are attractive and to kiss and hold hands. That changed for me when I fell in love for the first time but it didn&amp;#39;t last. The guy led me on and shamed me for loving him in front of all my peers and friends and seniors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t even looking for love when I found HIM. I met him at New Year&amp;#39;s Eve thing and at first, he seemed weird and unusual and to me not that far from possibly...crazy. I thought that was the last time I would see him but little did I know that I would see him again the next day and the day after and the day after and the day after. Somehow, we kept randomly bumping into each other and we started talking. Four days into it, I had become his friend and was about to leave when I was hanging out with him and our friends when our eyes met over the crowd and I swear to mother-fu*king god, his eyes were the most gorgeous I&amp;#39;ve ever seen. I actually couldn&amp;#39;t breathe in the moment and I still recall the moment exactly, starting with where he was and I was, what I was wearing, what he was wearing, our surroundings, etc. I&amp;#39;m not going to tell you it was love at first sight. It definitely wasn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just grew a crush on him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, I was flipping into chances to know him, to meet him, to be with him. I hung out with his friends and day by day, I got to know him better. Everything that I saw from the way he giggled instead of laughed to teasing his older brother on being shorter than him to his quiet eyes that scanned his surroundings to the way he could goof off and starting singing the Minions theme song but immediately become serious to his funny antics got me heading straight for the hills. The last straw for how I truly knew I loved him was when I saw him working day and night to achieve his dream  and nearly pass out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell in love around three or four or five months into it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been two years guys. I have gotten to know him better and I have seen his flaws from his insecurities to his sometimes mean behavior to how superficial he can be to naive to being stupid to many other things that I can&amp;#39;t say. They have ALL made me love him even more and I find myself excited, thrilled, positively beaming to find out more flaws and more secrets and more hidden stories that I find myself already holding a place in my heart to keep locked up. I fall deeper and deeper and deeper for him everyday and that love just grew bigger. He held me as I was crying, falling hard into my eating disorder and getting treatment and therapy to watching me get so angry I nearly broke everything in my house and he still held me. Guys, he stood by me when everyone left. He told me it was going to be okay, he made me feel loved and he made me smile when my parents told me to leave and how worthless I am. My sweet beautiful boy was there every single step of the way and all I pray now, all I beg of the world and God, is not to kiss him or hold his hands [ which I also really want ] but to support him, to hold him when he is sad and be the first person he tells when he is happy, to hold his hands as he breaks and to stand by him and help him heal if he ever needs me. I want to take care of him when he is sick, give him massages when he is stressed, cheer the loudest when he accomplishes his dream, hug him after he has a bad day and so many things that I can&amp;#39;t even begin to decipher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he has a beautiful, talented, smart, nice girlfriend who can give him what he deserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t help but think he deserves an angel after seeing the boy who started bawling his eyes out when his friends were stressed and didn&amp;#39;t get the job they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I do? Do I pursue him or leave him be? If I can support him and love him quietly from the sides as his best friend or even friend and if he truly loves her and she makes him happy, I will not interfere even though my heart shatters every time I think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

It's somewhat misleading title, but I run dungeons and dragons games as a past time. This typically is met with not so enthusiasm to girls I try to pursue, and the ones who don't care usually have no interest in me.

My friend, we'll call him Gary, is a Cello player and so he sometimes goes to this place that is called Lil Violins or something like that. One day he decides to go while we are carpooling and geeks out over various things in store.

Well, the counter girl was really cute and helpful. Me being me, after a bit of time, started up conversation with her. We talked about books, games and movies. When DnD got brought up (I explained Im the DnD nerd and my friend is the music nut) she started asking questions about it.

Eventually Gary yells ""He's a dungeon master!"" which had her respond in pleading me to teach her. So I wrote my dungeon master alias, Skellie, along with my number on a sticky note and asked her to get in touch with me for a later meet up.

The next day she texted, and we scheduled a character creation date at a local game shop. We looked at dice, got to business, and of course got off track. We spent most of the day talking about other interests, random trivia we know, and watched random videos. This is very typical of DnD sessions done in person.

We ended up leaving there agreeing to meet wednesdays for sessions with Gary, but we couldn't do it that upcoming wednesday. So we instead scheduled a potential group bonding exercise and headed to the movies. Gary and friends all used the same excuse to bow out last minute, that they had work, so it was just violin girl and me.

Prior to us meeting, Gary told me that she was probably using dnd as an excuse to see me and she had a crush on me. I am completely clueless to these kinds of things, sooo.... I asked her directly. She didn't give me a straight answer until half way through the film, after noticing she was leaning one way, I told her she could lean on me. Instead of using me as a rest, we went in for the kiss. It was then that she admitted she ""might have a little crush on me.""

We are currently dating and have a dinner date upcoming. But man, I never expected DnD to be a catalyst for meeting my girl.

p.s. she is serious about learning dnd so we are continuing the dnd sessions.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well...

&lt;p&gt;My friend, we&amp;#39;ll call him Gary, is a Cello player and so he sometimes goes to this place that is called Lil Violins or something like that. One day he decides to go while we are carpooling and geeks out over various things in store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the counter girl was really cute and helpful. Me being me, after a bit of time, started up conversation with her. We talked about books, games and movies. When DnD got brought up (I explained Im the DnD nerd and my friend is the music nut) she started asking questions about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually Gary yells &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s a dungeon master!&amp;quot; which had her respond in pleading me to teach her. So I wrote my dungeon master alias, Skellie, along with my number on a sticky note and asked her to get in touch with me for a later meet up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day she texted, and we scheduled a character creation date at a local game shop. We looked at dice, got to business, and of course got off track. We spent most of the day talking about other interests, random trivia we know, and watched random videos. This is very typical of DnD sessions done in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up leaving there agreeing to meet wednesdays for sessions with Gary, but we couldn&amp;#39;t do it that upcoming wednesday. So we instead scheduled a potential group bonding exercise and headed to the movies. Gary and friends all used the same excuse to bow out last minute, that they had work, so it was just violin girl and me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to us meeting, Gary told me that she was probably using dnd as an excuse to see me and she had a crush on me. I am completely clueless to these kinds of things, sooo.... I asked her directly. She didn&amp;#39;t give me a straight answer until half way through the film, after noticing she was leaning one way, I told her she could lean on me. Instead of using me as a rest, we went in for the kiss. It was then that she admitted she &amp;quot;might have a little crush on me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently dating and have a dinner date upcoming. But man, I never expected DnD to be a catalyst for meeting my girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p.s. she is serious about learning dnd so we are continuing the dnd sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

So my very significant other (also male) wants me to fulfil my promise of living next to him. 

The only problem is he's now married.

And yes, we have ~~already slept several times~~ a history together.

We were best friends and roommates when we were in uni. He was in Engineering and I was in Business Ad so we never had classes together, but apart from classes we were pretty much together every time. We were also very physical, you know, like holding hands, hugging, and stuff, which, frankly, are not unusual in this side of the planet. I mean they're not automatically signs of gayness. It was for me, but I was never sure if it was the same for him. 

I mean I liked him more than just a bro from the onset but I never really had the courage to confess to him nor to ask him about it. Although people like us enjoy a much more tolerating society compared to other Asian countries, it's still some sort of an unspoken taboo and most parents would tend to force their children to hide their non-heterosexuality.

Fast forward to our final year in school, he had  a girlfriend. As expected, the girlfriend was the overly jealous type and would complain about the amount of time V.S.O. and I would spend together. She would even read our chats in between classes and would sometimes confront me about why V.S.O. would say he loves me, or that his mom wants to cook dinner for me the coming weekend. It got to a point where she would call me and beg me to give V.S.O and her some time to spend together and I would always say yes to it, despite my broken heart. 

They got into a fight for some unknown reason and the next thing I know, she had one of her guy friends who also live in our dorm to take a picture of myself and V.S.O. cuddling while asleep I think you can guess what happened after that.

V.S.O. being the coward that he was, went on academic leave and flew to Canada to study English. I was left alone to handle the disaster of being outed to the whole school who felt like it was their business to know who I was sleeping with. 

It was hell walking through corridors and literally everyone in the cafeteria would stay away from the table where I would eat and they would whisper / talk about me being the gay dude who spread my gayness and converted someone's boyfriend / made someone queer...as if that's remotely possible!

&amp;#x200B;

It was too much and I contemplated suicide but luckily I found a job and my professors agreed to let me work, it was my final semester anyway, and I was only left with a handful of general education courses -- no major ones. They gave me D's and C's, but it was okay. At least I got out of school and successfully graduated.

&amp;#x200B;

I deleted my Facebook account and changed numbers and didn't have contact with him until after 2 years when we accidentally met in the subway near H.Y. university and I tried to run away from him but he ended up chasing me and we hugged and all the bad memories came back and I just cried and cried and cried.

We ended up having sex, for the first time, that night. It was amazing, probably because it felt like a confirmation that my feelings were actually reciprocated and that I didn't imagine all the memories I have of him.

This went on for a few months, I also had a boyfriend then, who I broke up with, FOR HIM!!!

Then he told me that his company decided to send him to the U.S. for a 5 year project (He works for a big car company) and that I should quit my job and join him there. I work for a big group of companies, though not as big as his, and I simply can't quit my job and blindly follow him to the U.S., right? 

So I decided against it and I don't know why but after that, I was never able to find a relationship that lasted for more than a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got a call from him 7 months later that he's coming home to get married and that he wanted me to be the best man. I was so offended by this that I cut contact with him again.

&amp;#x200B;

It's only this month that we established contact once again. We've had video call on Facebook for the longeeeest time and he was trying to convince me to come and join him again. He reminded me of our promise to live next to each other as we grow old. He said he still loves me and he wants to be with me. I believe that. But the problem is, he's married! I'm sure the wife doesn't even know about this side of him! I know that this is morally wrong so I really can't bring myself to say yes to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Sadly, however, I don't think I'll ever be able to find another significant other...

I feel like I should not be choosy and just accept this chance at being happy, even if it comes with a sh\*tty set of terms and conditions... what do you guys think? #HELPME","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;WARNING - LONG POST&lt;/p&gt;

So this Jamal always comes up and talks to me about anything he can think of or anything we have in common, doesn’t matter what it is he will talk to me. For example we had a class together so he would ask me if I thought the homework was hard or if I knew how to do anything, stuff like that. And whenever I’m with the friend that introduced me to him, he will greet me first then her so I noticed that too. 

During our first semester, I’d been having a lot of mental health issues and just needed a break so I stopped going to class, idk where I’d be If I hadn’t have stopped going. But yeah everyday he would ask where I am to another one of our mutual friends and he would always say he misses me. At the time he didn’t have anyway to contact me outside of seeing each other in person. I went up to campus one day to visit my friends bc like I said I stopped going and my mutual friend texted him and and let him know I was here and he came to where we were and he gave me the biggest hug ever and told me he missed me. We talked for a little and he left so I thought that was sweet of him  

Another thing is he’s always sooo excited and happy to see me like he’s always hella smiley when I’m around. I’m kind of the same way lol. 

Recently like 3 days ago, me my two mutual friends and him all hung out. We went out for food and had a good time. That day is when i realized I like him. Idk what it was but we finally got to talk together and have some space from everyone and it was just us and we kinda clicked in my opinion. We were laughing the whole time. One of the friends that was with us pulled me aside and we went to the bathroom bc girls go to the br together lol but she was basically saying how she thinks he likes me and how since day one she’s been waiting for us to get together and stuff and she said the chemistry is there... she’s not wrong at all. And sometimes I noticed we would play fight like flirting a little. 

I didn’t even realize I liked him til that day tbh, but everything added up. Every time I we text I would kind of get nervous and wonder why now I know. Whenever I see him in person I get excited and I always want to hug him. And I genuinely think he’s such a sweetheart, he accepts me for who I am, I know that bc he actually took the tome to get to know me and get through the awkwardness, most people just think I’m weird and shy and rude so they stop talking to me but he didn’t do that... I guess he saw something in me? and he’s really cute and tall...❤️

One of our mutual friends told me “he likes you” and I asked him “did he say the three words?? I like (my name)” he said “well he said he enjoys your company and he says he misses you all the time, and he thinks you’re funny.” And that’s just not clear at all, that could mean anything. 

But let me get into why I’m unsure of his feelings for me... he’s friends with A LOT of people. And A LOT of girls... maybe I’m just one of those girls that he befriended. And when we first started knowing each other he asked me if I had any friends for him to date and he asked if one of my friends was single and stuff... and that moves me onto me not being his type. His type is “black and pretty” in his words. He even asked me if I could give him one of my friends number and they look NOTHING like me. I’m not the prettiest as I’m not hella skinny either. I don’t really wear makeup that often either so I just don’t know. 

So basically I just don’t know... I kind of just wanna come out and tell him straight on that I like him and why kind of like “confessing my love” except I don’t love him lol. but I don’t wanna ruin our friendship if things go south or if he just doesn’t feel the same. Honestly If one of our mutual friends could tell him and get his reaction I would be good. I would either stop hanging out where they dorm if he doesn’t like me OR I would come and hang out all the time if he does. Can someone help me know the best way to go about this?

We[20MF] have been in a rough LDR for 3 years. First 2 years went good with a bit of fights but it has been down road since then. 

We almost broke up since my gf [20F] wanted me to change and be better with her because I’ve hurt her emotionally so much but she still gave me another chance at the end of the year.

It’s been a week since then and she’s feeling like we’re being the same again. She told me she’s giving me a chance so I grow up, Change myself and become more mature and self aware. I took it serious but I didn’t know how to show her all that. 

She complained again 4 days ago that I’m not even trying anything. To make her feel happy or to even make her want me anymore even though she doesn’t feel much for me now. 

I really love her so much but I don’t know how to express that to her without really saying because she’s more of a person who prefers to see things happening that show efforts and that I am trying for her and us. But I don’t know what to do. 

Secondly, she’s been asking me to talk about something for 4 days since she’s been so frustrated with her family crises. And I don’t know what exactly to talk to her about. She says she talks to me and hopes to relax from all the stress and all but I only add up more to it. 


She keeps asking me to talk about something and if I do, all I can think about is talking about my problems or her problems or complimenting her or talking related to my family and she likes none of those to talk about because my family particularly doesn’t like her so much. 

So I want to ask is, what do I talk to her about when she says, “Talk about something else.” But doesn’t feel interested in these topics and says I talk boring things only. 

Please advice me on this or hint me what I should be doing? And sorry about the long post.

I wasn’t particularly keen on the guy , but he seemed fun and I though I had nothing to lose.
We went to this bar in central London and had a chat . It was an ok date , but I didn’t feel like it. I was polite enough to stay for few hours and talk to the guy . 

Around 10pm I decided that it was time to go home and call it a night. We said our goodbyes and I headed to the nearest tube station . I remember being slightly tipsy and just enjoying listening to music when at the next stop he got on . 

He is very tall , very sporty / athletic looking ,has piercing blue eyes and a dark hair . He definitely got my attention, but I tried not to stare . Girls stare at him a lot when we are out . 😂

I remember I smiled at him , he smiled back , but I never really have my hopes up since London is not a place where people chat you up . Anyway he sat next to me, I instantly felt some crazy energy between us , but I knew my stop was coming so I stood up to get off .

I sensed a tap and there is he asking if I can give him my number. He was quite drunk , so I didn’t know what to make of it . I gave him my number and later on I got a text from him :

Hey nice to meet you I’m so and so . I will text you tomorrow . Have a good night .

I replied back and said goodnight .

The next day he messaged me which was nice . I learnt that he was from New York , but his mum was English, he moved here recently and wanted to start a fresh . New York was too much for him . In a sense I know why he feels that way . When I visited New York I found it hectic and a strange city .

We decided to meet the following week. It was easy since we both work in central London , so it was convenient for both of us .

We met at a bar near Tower Hill.  I was surprised that he was more than a good looking guy . I have met quite few good looking guys , but they were very basic. I felt they relied on their looks not their personality. However he was different, he was funny ( still is ) , he was intelligent and quirky . 

We bounded over love for travelling , video games , history , philosophy. 

It was a real change. We had few drinks ( there went my dry January resolution). We kissed and I went home . 

We went on a second date few days later and since then we have been together.

It’s been 3 years and I still get butterflies when I see him . We live together now and plan to get married next year . 

I can’t say it’s been all roses . We’ve had our moments , but I truly feel we get each other and can overcome whatever comes our way .

We have gone on multiple days, had sex, talked about personal stuff, and he’s very affectionate. Our conversations are always productive, and we do communicate a lot. I usually see him twice every two weeks

There are a few things I’m concerned about, and I’m not sure where this is going, or he’s just using me for his own convenience or if he’s talking to someone else. Keep in mind that I’m always there for him when he’s depressed and needs someone to talk to and someone who listens. 

I started feeling insecure about things fairly recently, and it’s not because of things I made up in my mind; it’s because of things I have noticed while spending time with him and talking over WhatsApp.

I started feeling like this when we went out on a date this past December to Washington Square Park. I noticed a conversation he was having with another guy. They were calling each other baby and papi and sending each other the kissing emoji. I brought this up to him immediately and demanded an explanation. He told me that’s how he shows affection to friends, and I told him that I find that disrespectful because he’s with me, and he shouldn’t be calling other people like that because it could be easily interpreted. One, I will think he’s talking to other people, and two, since we’re discreet (I’ve only met his family, but he introduced me as a friend, and I haven’t met his friends, and I’d really like to), his friends and acquaintances don’t know abt us, so him calling them like will think he’s available.  We talked abt it, and he agreed to remain using those terms with me only. I told that those terms are special to me, and that should only be used among the two of us.

Few days after, he wanted me to accompany him to the hospital. When he was asked for his social security, he had a picture of it saved on his phone. As he was looking for it on his photo albums, he noticed I was looking and then proceeded to turn around so I wouldn’t see and he smiled. This was the third time he did it, and out of respect, I never asked because I wanted to respect his privacy. He also does this when answering messages from friends and acquaintances; not family members. After leaving the hospital, I brought it up to him, and I asked him why he acts suspicious when answering messages on social media and looking through his photo albums. He told me he has pornography of his friends on his phone saved, but said this was before us, and that he will delete him, which according to him he did after that convo. He began to answer messages of his friends next to me but I saw him deleting convos on WhatsApp. He agreed that things could be misinterpreted, and we talked about it.

I’ve been insisting in meeting his friends and people he hangs out with. He said that he will, but never does. For me, meeting his friends is important, and at times, I feel like he’s hiding me and doesn’t want people to know. For example, today, he was hanging out with his acquaintances at their place because they were having a party. I FaceTimed him exactly at 12am to wish him a happy 2020. We talked for a bit. It was a bit loud inside but he walked out from the apartment so he could hear me better. I asked him to send me kisses over FaceTime multiple times to test something. He was facing the door of the apartment, which was open, and there were people by the door. Every time I asked him he would turn around, having his back facing the door to hide his kisses. I also told him to introduce to his friends right there and then but he didn’t want to. 

A lot of other stuff have happened but these are the major ones. I don’t know what to do or what to think. A friend of mine told me that’s he’s using me for his convenience, for sex, etc without compromising.

There's a really special guy I like, who even invited me to his birthday (his birthday was some days ago idk if u care lol). I told him, that I don't want to go because I don't really like anyone there beside him. When he realized, that I won't come, he invited 3 of my friends (not my besties, just some friends we share) but none of them came. Because I didn't knew, that one of them ain't coming, I went to his birthday.. and it was reallyy weird for me. Later on, when we chatted on WhatsApp I told him that I really tried it because of him and he answered: aww. 

In the winter break we plan to meet up but I'll wait for him to ask me, because I already did twice (he did it once, but when we had a lil fight so it didn't worked out). 2 and a half years ago I confessed my feelings for him, but back then I was 12 and he didn't like me back but in general we just weren't ready for anything serious at this point. I told him in June 2017, but after March 2018 we lost contact, as we started fighting.  After I had been in another relationship and other stuff happened, we got in contact again on our class trip in September 2019.

In october I asked him to meet up and we went to another city, where we had a really great time and we also talked about how sad it was that we lost contact and how nice it is, that we are back at spending time together again. Since 2 weeks we chat very often about different random stuff and nowadays he ain't ignoring my flirt attempts on whatsapp and he even sends the blushing emoji and aww like in the example.

Some other day I told him, that I'm scared to be as annoying as one other girl, who he dislikes, he told me that it's definitely not likely to happen. 

So he isn't really avoiding my flirt attempts and he also always tries to make me feel good about myself, but I don't know if he does this because of love or friendship..

My best friend says I should wait, before I tell him, because if I don't, even if he is developing feelings, he will be confused what to answer. I understand where she's coming from, but I don't want to wait to long, because the longer I'll wait, the more rejection will hurt.

So should I wait, before I tell him and if so, for how long?
And if I shouldn't wait, should I tell him this, the next time we meet up?
