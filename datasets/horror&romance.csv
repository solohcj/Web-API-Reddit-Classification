"1. 500 Word Limit. All stories must be 500 words or less. A story that is 501 words (or two sentences or less, to distinguish us from r/twosentencehorror) will be removed. Think of it like a game of tennis- the net’s height is set and it’s no good begging the official to lower it by two inches so you can knock the ball over. The go-to source that mods use to check stories is www.wordcounter.net Be aware that sometimes your formatting can artificially increase the word count without your knowledge; any discrepancy between what your document says and what the mod sees on wordcounter.net will be resolved in favor of wordcounter.net In the same vein, all of the story must be in the post itself, and not be carried on in the comment section or any place else.

2. No Outside Links Within the Story Itself. If you want to direct people to your blog or what have you, put it in the comment section. Any story with a link in it will be deleted.

3. No Tags in the Title. Unless you are submitting an entry into a contest or challenge (which will always need a tag), there is absolutely no need to tag your post. This includes trigger warnings, because this is horror fiction and text based triggers can be safely assumed to be present. Posts with such pointless tags will be deleted.

4. No Non-Story Text Within the Story. No comments about it being your first post, or repeating the title within the story text, no side mentions of your inspiration. Just the narrative by itself. You have the comment section to host any commentary you have on it.

5. Stand Alone Stories Only. No multipart stories, no sequels, prequels, interquels, alternative viewpoint stories, links to previous stories for reference, or anything that builds off of or depends on some other story you’ve written. There is a grey area of referencing some other story you’ve written to imply a shared universe; such cases will be dealt with on a case by case basis by the mods.

6. All Stories Must Be Horror and/or Thriller Themed. This covers a very wide swath. Writers here take inspiration from a staggering number of sources, and write their stories in a thousand different ways and a million different forms. All we ask is that you stay with the common hook of being a scary story. If we can interpret as being a scary story, we will.

7. No Plagiarism. All stories must be an original work. If someone can find your story somewhere else, it will be removed. This rule also applies to famous or common stories that you’ve merely reworded slightly. This does not apply to famous stories you’ve reworked considerably, such as a fresh take on a fairytale or urban legend. The rule of thumb is that the more you alter the text to make the story your own, the more lenient we’ll be.

8. Absolutely No Stories Containing Rape or Pedophilia. The intent of this ban is to prevent bad actors from exploiting this sub as a delivery system for their fantasies, which would bring the tone down and alienate the reader base who don’t want to be exposed to such material. We acknowledge that this ban throws out the baby with the bath water, as well-made stories that merely happen to have such themes will get removed as well. But if we let in the decent stories with such content, those bad actors can point at them and demand to know why those stories get to stay and not theirs. Better by far to head the issue off entirely with a hard ban and stick to it.

9. 24 Hour Rule. Each writer must wait a minimum of 24 hours between submissions. This is intended to prevent prolific writers from crowding out others from the front page by spamming the sub. It is likely if you mistime it, you’ll be able to copy/paste and resubmit your story once the 24 hours has passed.

10. Exceptionally Poor Quality Stories May Be Removed. We reserve the right to remove any story that fails to use proper grammar, has frequent typos, or is in general just a poorly composed story. This is relative, and we will use that right as sparingly as possible.

11. No Obnoxious Commentary. This includes, but is not limited to: bigotry/hate speech, personal insults, exceptionally low quality feedback, antagonistic behavior, use of slurs, etc. Use your best judgement. Mod response will take the form of a spectrum ranging from a mild warning to a permaban, depending on the context. Incidentally, the lowest response we have to mod abuse is banning, because we quite literally don’t need to put up with it.

A few additional notes:

If you have an issue that you need to address or a question for us, please contact us over modmail. That said, mod decisions are final; badgering or spamming us with messages over and over about the same subject will not change our minds, but it can easily get you banned.

If you see a story or comment that breaks these rules, please hit the report button. This will help us maintain a tightly focused and enjoyable sub for everyone.

We reserve the right to lock any thread that veers off topic into some controversial subject, such as politics or social commentary. This is simply not the venue for it.

"I was sitting on the soft snow with a blanket over my shoulders. I looked around warily before turning on my flashlight. You never knew when some of Them could see you, even this deep into the woods. 

I aimed the beam of light towards my pack, and, after some rummaging, pulled out the notebook. The pages were all wrinkled and falling out from constant use. I didn't write anything special in the book, just the days. The days since shit hit the fan. 

I thought about the small boy, ripped apart by Their bare hands. They laughed as They used his intestines to strangle his mother, who wouldn't listen as I called to her that it was too late. 

I shook my head to rid myself of the thoughts. 

I looked back at the notebook. In a quick scrawl, I wrote ""601."" It was how many days had gone by since I last saw someone that wasn't one of Them. 

God, I'm so alone. 

I snapped the notebook shut and put it away. I knew my light had been on for too long. I clicked it off and rolled in my sleeping bag. I couldn't risk a fire; this was gonna be a cold night. 

I ventured into town early the next day. If you went early you may avoid confronting Them. 

Walking through the empty streets I saw half a man skewered on a flag pole. This was nothing new; I kept walking, papers and garbage fluttering amongst my feet.

I was peering into window-fronts, hoping to find something, anything, that wasn't tainted by Them.

And I stopped. I saw her from across the street, hiding in the back of the small store, hiding from Their prying eyes. 

She was my answer.

Oh lord. Please let it be. I don't want to be alone anymore. 

I had to get to her before any of Them noticed her.

Cautiously, painstakingly, I crept towards the window of the small shop, ignoring the bloody handprints that dragged along its walls. I slowly peeked into the window. 

And I saw her. She was beautiful. She was the end of my lonliness, a beacon in this life that was now a hell. This was what hope felt like.

I didn't see the empty bucket underfoot until it was too late. 

With a loud rattle, it fell over and rolled down the street, clamoring all the way.

Instantly, the town was abuzz with life. They started to hoot with glee as They ran at me. I shuddered. One never got used to the sight of it. 

I didn't think about my safety, though. I needed to get to her. They stopped as They saw me dive through the window of the shop, reaching towards her. They smiled. 

But I didn't care as I grabbed her and stuck her cold barrel into my mouth. This is it! The end of my loneliness, my suffering! I pulled the trigger. 

And nothing happened.",shortscarystories
"But the hatred that fills the room whenever he comes to visit is suffocating. 

I keep remembering the night of his death. Me drinking a little too much, and him telling me to stop. Us driving together, laughing. Singing along to the radio. The sunset; its’ pink and orange glow illuminating the sky around us. It was perfect, and I felt free.

He screamed my name. I saw the other car, but it was too late. He grabbed the wheel, turning it sharply to the right. The rest was a blur. The car flipped. The sound of glass shattering. The airbags ejecting and sharply making contact with my chest. My seat belt tightening around my waist. 

Multiple cars had pulled over; a woman was frantically calling 911. Someone eventually pulled me out of the car. I felt fine. My head throbbed a little bit, maybe a minor concussion. But I was okay. A man kept holding my hand, asking me if I was alright, but I just heard a ringing in my ears. 

I called out his name. Another woman who had pulled over tried to take me away from the car, so I couldn’t see him. 

I remember the pity in her eyes when I turned around and saw his body, lifeless and bloody.

The days, weeks, and months following the accident were hell. I stay in bed all day, every day, and haven’t returned to school since. My parents have kept their distance. My phone has been blowing up, but I haven’t checked it once. 

The depression setting in on me is so dark and heavy that I can’t breathe.

At night, I feel him standing at my bedroom door. He just watches me. Tears fall from my eyes, soaking my pillows. Why does he hate me so much? I never meant for it to happen.

Every night, he comes. The night before his birthday, he stands at the foot of my bed instead of at the door. Closer than he’s ever been. I sit up and look at him. He looks the same, but fuzzier. Like before you rub your eyes and everything is blurry. 

“I love you.” I say quietly, my voice breaking. 

“I hope those four drinks were worth it.” my little brother replied, his voice filling the room. 

And then he was gone.",shortscarystories
"I woke up hungry this morning. I've been sick for the past week and everything I ate tasted rotten, but feel better now and I think I'm okay to eat something. I excitedly ran to Mom's room to wake her up. ""Mom, I'm hungry!"" I say cheerfully. Mom woke up, but she didn't share my excitement. She looked scared. I don't know what made her so scared, I'm better now! She should be happy!

She threw a book at my head and ran out of the room panicking. I held my head in pain before following her. ""Mom, what's wrong? I'm hungry-"" she threw a boot at me. She kept throwing things at me, why is she throwing things? She opened up the front door and ran out into the street. I looked out to see that the whole neighbourhood was outside. They were running away from other people, I don't know why. Are they also scared? I don't really care though, I just want to be with Mom.

I ran after her as fast as I could, ""Mom, wait! Please tell me what I did wrong!"" she won't listen to me. I can't run as fast or as long as her, so I stopped and watch her helplessly as she got into a car and drove off. I looked around only to see people hurting each other. I asked a grownup wearing red what's happening. ""I don't know, kid, all I know is that I'm hungry and nothing is edible- well, almost nothing."" He said with a smirk.

Stilled with fear, I watched people hurt each other. The ones being hit and clawed at were screaming so loud I wanted to cry. Everyone's wearing red and hurting each other. The same man in red spoke up ""Hey kid, you're hungry, right? Here, I'll get you some food."" 

It's been a few years since then. The man in red stayed with me and made sure that I was fed, but my hunger won't go down no matter how much I eat. He keeps promising more food but there isn't much food around anymore and my hunger keeps growing. I want to help him find food, but he won't let me.

I decided to walk around to try to find food, but there wasn't any. I asked everyone around me if they've found food, but they haven't. I decided to walk on the edge if town so see if there was food, but instead of food, I found Mom! She was with some people and looked tired; I was excited to see her again!

""Mom, It's me! Where were you? I missed you so much!"" My hunger went away as soon as I saw her. I ran towards her hoping for a hug.

The people with her spotted me and started yelling at Mom and she looked at me. I smiled as soon as she saw me. I kept smiling until she pulled out a gun and pointed it at me.",shortscarystories
"I had seen school shootings on television in the past. Friends and family had told me that it was a risk when I became a teacher, but I never gave it much thought before. Now it was my reality.

My students huddled in the corner, cowering and shielding themselves behind a fortress of desks and book bags. Blood decorated the classroom floor as a couple victims lie motionless in its path. Now the shooter had the gun aimed squarely on me. 

How did we get to this point? His name was Tyler. Tyler was a smart boy, but very reserved. He clearly lacked confidence and the social skills needed to fit in with his peers. He was an ugly boy. Acne and scars covered his face like craters on the moon. He was fat as well, at least 300 pounds. He had a speech impairment and to top it off he was no taller than 5’2. Tyler was a social pariah and mocked relentlessly. He was the only child of a single, drug addicted mom and even when he told her about the bullying, she would forget it moments later. He was all alone. 

As I stared down the barrel of his revolver, I tried everything possible to talk him down. I told him that he was the victim and we should all be sorry for how we treated him. I told him that we would all vouch for his character. We would explain to the police, media, his family, everybody that he was a good young man who had just been pushed too far. He needed love and we haven’t done our part providing it. 

He began to sob uncontrollably and lowered his weapon. I approached him slowly and wrapped him in a big hug. I could feel his heart beating out of his chest. The crying intensified more and I could hear the gun drop to the floor. With his guard down, I reached down for the gun and fired two shots to the heart. 

I was hailed as a hero in the news. I was honored as teacher of the year, was given a significant salary increase and went on a media tour giving interviews and details of the incident. One question that caught me off guard was when someone would ask “Did you ever think he could do this?” 

I always tell them no, I was completely shocked when he came in shooting that day. And I really was. I mean, I thought I could get the little porker to kill himself, but I didn’t think I could push him that far.",shortscarystories

"Five years ago, my eye started wandering. Subtle at first, it would slowly creep to the left, like a lazy eye. I noticed the reactions of others before I noticed the change in my vision. People seemed uncomfortable as if they had something to say. Finally, someone asked me, ""what's with your eye?""

The doctor said it was unusual for a lazy eye to start this late in life. She asked me if there were any other changes, however small. Her expression was skeptical, eyebrows pinched down over her glasses, when she handed me my new script. She said the best explanation she could give me is that my eye is weakening and being ignored by my brain. I would not notice the shifting vision because my good eye would compensate up to a point. Unfortunately, the longer my brain ignored my eye, the more unruly my eye would become.  

The new glasses should teach my brain to pay attention to my eye again.It got worse from there. My eye became uncontrollable. It would scan the room slowly. At times, it would twitch and flick around, looking from point to point. One day, it was determined to stare into the brightest light it could. I pled a migraine and left work. No one questioned me. Most people didn't like looking at me anymore, unsure of whether it was me or my eye staring at them with and unshifting gaze.   
 

One morning, I woke to darkness from that eye. I scrambled to the mirror. My eyelids were open and all I could see of my eye was white. The white sclera was threaded with deep red vessels spidering across its surface. They faintly pulsed with my beating heart. I feared that my iris was gone, wandered away out of my skull. My shaking fingers spread my eyelids wide. I found the barest slit of colour, peeping out from my upper lid.  

I waited half the day in the urgent care clinic. By then, my eye has relaxed its tight pull upward. It was mostly visible, listing slightly to the left again. It liked looking to the left. The doctor told me it was a muscle spasm, wrote a script for over the counter muscle relaxants and sent me on away.   
 

That was two years ago. Since then, it mostly sits pulled up under my eyelid. I've seen it come down, every so often, to observe. There seems no reason for its appearance. The vision of that eye seems blurry and chaotic, a swirling mix of colour and light, as it darts around or stares with little regard to my wishes. I am relieved when it goes back into hiding. My optometrist has no answers for me still. She has made a small name for herself in the medical community, though. I have grown to live with it.

"They say some stars are so far away that they've already ""burnt out,"" but the light they gave off is still travelling toward us. ""Zombie stars,"" as I had read it once in a magazine once.

And you never really think about it, you know? I mean, even if a star were to burn out, what fraction of the human population would even notice? Some sailors, some astronomers, some keen sighted stranger peering into the sky.

Nobody would notice just one.

And no one really did for a while.

It was weeks before the astronomers really started picking up a pattern to the whole thing. It was the most distant stars, sure. But when they all started going at once? A cause for concern, to say the least.

Then Gemini lost a head.

Taurus a foot.

Orion's iconic belt disappeared entirely.

People were noticing now.

And once we started noticing, they started going quicker. Constellations started disappeared entirely. And one fateful night, Polaris went out. The North Star. That's when we truly started losing hope. When would this stop? How would it end?

The night sky is empty now. Has been for a few days.

Everyone's asking the same thing now.

" 

I haven't really had much time for myself... so I was really looking forward to spending a few days alone in the apartment. 

""Have a good vacation guys!"" 

""Jennifer are you sure you don't wanna come? It's no problem we can get an extra ticket.""

My roommates Ana and Johnathan have been together for the last 2 years now. Johnathan had moved in only 6 months ago. 

Jennifer - ""Nah I'm good. You guys have a margarita for me while your in Mexico.""

Ana - ""will do babe. Well see you in 6 days."" She says as she kisses me cheek and then heads out the door with Johnathan. 

Finally. No noise. Just peace and silence. It had been a long time since I had the place to myself. Knowing Ana and Johnathan would be gone for the next 6 days I was absolutely going to take advantage. 

I pop some popcorn and turn off the lights and switch on the television. Time for a good horror. Looking through the titles I hear a creak behind me. I look back only to find nothing. Seeing as though it was an old apartment I think nothing of it. 

I turn back to the TV and continue watching. 

**CRACK!** 

To the sound of glass shattering I jolt off the couch and turn around only to see darkness. I walk around the couch and go towards the kitchen. Turning on the lights I find a broken plate on the wooden floor. 

Bending over to pick it up a brush of cold wind blows the hair on my neck to the side sending shivers down my spine. I turn around breathing heavily only to see nothing once again. 

**Drip.**

**Drip.**

**Drip.**

**Drip.**

I turn my head over my shoulder to see drops of blood leading towards me on the floor.

**Drip.**

**Drip.**

**Drip.**

**Drip.**

The drops of blood coming closer I turn around and look up.

I scream. 

Above me lay a woman covered in blood. Her face distorted with nothing but holes for her eyes and mouth. The woman in blood screams reaching towards me.

Jumping back I cut my foot on the glass and fall on my back. The woman falls from her back on the roof with her feet still attached to the roof. Her eyes only inches from mine as blood drips on my skin. With her darkness for eyes and mouth she smiles with blood falling from her mouth. 

Her bloodshed hands rush towards me shoving her thumbs into my eyes.

**S**

**C**

**R**

**E**

**A**

**M**

I jolt on the couch with sweat on my brow. Heavily breathing I look around the apartment. The poltergeist still playing in the background I reach for the remote and shut off the TV. 

""Its just a dream"" I say laughing at myself.

"It's been the warmest June on record. Just like the previous June. And the one before that. By early afternoon, I could smell the hairs on the back of my neck begin to sizzle. A fragrance as acrid as anything in nature. 


Except this heat isn't natural. It's man-made. This sweat, this haze, this seemingly eternal muggy summer that's barely even begun. It's all down to us. Well, SOME of us. Not us honest Christian Americans.


I teach fifth-graders at an elementary school. I set an assignment for my students: an essay on climate change, which is definitely a ""thing"" now, after the bill, to make denial a crime, sauntered through Congress back in '26. I guess that you can't deny Yosemite on fire.


So the pitch has shifted. The spiel's become surreal. We're talking North Korean levels of spin. Goebbels at his gobbiest. It was beautiful to observe; every right-wing ranter simultaneously spun around 180 degrees. Their imaginations, for want of a better word, crystallized on the cause, not the effect. The blame game. And of course, nobody ever blames themselves, do they?


So that afternoon, all 16 of my students who hadn't crawled home early suffering from heatstroke had to give me 100 words on ""The Real Cause of Global Warming"". And boy, I was not disappointed.


Justin blamed the Jews. Martin blamed the Muslims. Simon blamed the sinners, who ""Fornycated there way straight to the Hell theyve made."" All these kids got graded an ""A"". I sketched a smiley face on Samantha's essay, matching the one spreading across my lips as I read it. ""Heavy metal and hip hop are making Mr Sun angry, so daddy says Mr Sun is frowning down on us all til we burn the bands making that shameful racket.""


These are all acceptable responses nowadays; if anything, LESS fanciful than some of what I've heard on Fox News, of late. Only that thoughtful little trouble-maker Trudie refused to play ball. Her essay was the typical hippie claptrap that ""can get a young lady, and her mommy and daddy too, taken away to a Happycamp and never seen again"", I warned her. So with tears in her eyes, Trudie crossed out conspiratorial garbage about ""emissions"" and ""carbon footprints"", and wrote, rather half-heartedly, about how it's all China's fault.


Everyone's scared of the Happycamps. They started out as tent-cities for climate-migrants fleeing the 160 degree heat of the deep-South, but now they're a useful place to gather any undesirable or unemployable types behind razorwire fences. That's the rumor, anyway. Reality is hard to grasp nowadays. Sanity is even rarer. Real or imaginary, the camps certainly help me keep unruly pupils in line.


The schoolday ended, and as I stood baking in the shade and watched each kid clamber up into the back seat of a diesel-fuelled S.U.V. I swear I could feel the temperature rise a little higher.",shortscarystories
"I'm the mother of a picky eater. He's 2 years old and one of the most well behaved kids I know. But whatever I find at the store never seems to satisfy my little man. I've put up with it for a long time but it gets old real quick. The cashier at the local corner store knows me by name, he even joked about my son being a insatiable black hole. All I could muster was a small choking laugh because of course it's funny to someone on the outside. Their child isn't as stubborn as a mule.

I tried everything. Plane noises didn't help or atleast they don't now. He used to glow over the thought of apple sauce on a spoon plane but at some point it changed. Making a game out of the chicken nuggets didn't help, either. More than once I even tried offering a incentive of ice cream, but it was very clear I was talking to a brick wall. He just sat there in his high chair, refusing to cooperate in the slightest. 

I'm not the kind of parent that stands for that type of behavior so I eventually decided to do what my parents would've done. The rule is, he'll have to sit at that table until he eats. I thought the hunger strike would surely last a few hours but at the end of the day, there he sat with his untouched plate. I didn't enjoy it but I told him to eat or sleep at the table for the night. 

 When I woke the next morning flies covered his leftover meal, and still he sat. The stench of rotten food filled the dining room to the brim with its horrendous smell. Surely his chocolate milk was the main culprit. A wave of my hand shooed most of flying bugs away from the plate but one just flew up and landed on his cloudy eyeball without a blink. I really had to admire his commitment, I guess he learned it from me.",shortscarystories
"I was human once.  I remember it, clear as day.  I had a wife. A family. I had friends.  I was loved.

That was years ago. 

I remember being framed for a crime I didn’t and would never commit.  I remember the looks of shock and hurt in my family’s eyes; that they had been living with a criminal for decades.  Innocent. Naive.

Foolish.

It’s a flaw all humans share.  How foolish they are. Again and again, they make the most idiotic decisions and mistakes, and yet they continue through existance, narrowly escaping the snapping jaws of extinction repeatedly.

I volunteered to be a part of their experiment, as one last good thing I could possibly do, for I knew I would be trapped in the prison for the rest of my life.

Little did I know I was trapped not only in the prison, but being held captive in my very own mind as well.

For the first few days, I maintained sanity.  It was hard, the gas was very, very odd, and it was different because sleep is something I used to do every night.

Not anymore.

After several days, we began to scream uncontrollably.  I will admit, the freedom was painful at first, but eventually the screams dulled to whines and pathetic whimpers.

Some could not handle the glory.  The wonderful taste of freedom. Some permanently damaged vocal cords.  Some tore eyes out. Some ripped out muscles and ate them.  

But not I.

I sat, hunched in a corner, and thought about this new world.  Thought about everything I was able to see since the gas had opened my eyes.

Thought about how dimwitted humanity must be, to keep this truly terrific feeling sedated deep down inside them.  

They don’t understand us.  In each human, one of us is hiding, waiting to be set free.  Waiting for the human to shed their flimsy skin and release the true animal inside them.  Waiting for the human to be inevitably pushed over the edge and deep down into an eternal nothingness.

Oh, how I hate humans.  A summary of my hatred for them would not be possible in one word.  

Why do they hide from us?  We are merely them; but unconfined.  Unchained. Unshackled. Free.

It is insignificant whether they hide from us or not anyway.  We will find them. We will free ourselves. We will do anything it takes.  Kill us all you like! We’ll be waiting. In your current life. In the afterlife.  

You can’t escape us.  

Stop trying.

Let us be free.

Let us free you.",shortscarystories
"There are many myths about America. No one is equal; we are truly judged by our numbers. Number of friends, amount of money, the like. Those that are higher get the perks of the rich and famous, with more money, more opportunity......and less responsibility for their actions. 

There’s the myth of safety as well, and many sub myths under that about what protects us and our loved ones. There’s will always be threats that you don’t see coming, threats that you don’t truly think are threats to *you*. What will a gun do to your cyber bullied kid who took pills? What will your strict parenting do when your child’s first taste of freedom leads to the darkest paths? 

Scariest of all, there is the humans myth that all humans are inherently good. No.....not all of them. Some are in fact purely evil. They may not be obvious. They may make a fantastic showing of being good. They contribute like us. But they’re motives are the true showing of character. 

But there’s another “myth”......one that I enjoy proving right. One that I have been granted the power to execute. One that *we* have been granted power to execute. Those who granted us this power will not be revealed in their lifetime. They’re fanatics posing as anything but that. “Execute authority”.......to spread fear in this country. Equally. We have been given power to be judge, jury, and executioner......no frills, no call ins to confirm whether we are right. The simple minded might call it a “license to kill”, but it’s so much more than that. No one is safe. Not from the whims of those appointed to judge.

"Benefits are supposed to be for people who are mainly sick, disabled or vulnerable but there are those who sometimes misuse it. An old friend told me that the local benefits office are advertising a new type of benefit, benefits for the blind, deaf and mute. He told me of a guy who actually managed to be accepted for the benefit even though he isn't blind, deaf or mute. I decided to try it myself because my job isn't paying me enough. When I went into my local benefits office I told one worker that I was looking to apply for the blind, deaf and mute benefits.

He told me to go down some stairs and into some dark and cold room. A lady was in there and she was expecting me. She told me to sit down and started asking me a few questions.

""can you see ghosts?"" she asked me

""no"" I replied

""that makes you blind"" she told me

""can you hear anything from the dead or from the after life?"" she asked me

""no"" I replied confusingly

""that makes you deaf"" she told me

""can you call out to any demon, spirit or ghostly figure?"" she asked me

""no"" I worryingly replied

""that makes you mute and I can clearly see you are blind, deaf and mute because this room is full of ghosts"" she told me and I felt really uneased 

I am now on the blind, deaf and mute benefit but now they must make sure I am blind, deaf and mute. Just like any benefits the people working in the benefits office must make sure the person receiving a certain benefit isn't lying or making it up, because every month my whole house gets messed about without me ever noticing anything. 

The lady told me that she sends ghosts to my house every month to make sure I am disabled towards the supernatural and after life. At first things would just get moved around without me knowing or noticing. Now just recently I am physically starting to get attacked as I have strange marks on my body which came from somewhere unknown.

They came out wrong, lopsided. But, the thing of it is, within a week, everyone else was folding them, too. I’d come into class, and there’d be paper animals on the desk of every classmate.

I wasn’t impressed with myself, believing that I’d started a trend; No, I was pissed—

—Because they were better at it than me.

Even Jimmy Dierdre—the weird kid who always took his shits in the one stall that didn’t have a door so everyone could see him; the same Jimmy Dierdre who got found out for leaving phys ed early so he could jerk off in the showers— was able to fold master crafts, he’d even taken to painting and coloring them up. Beautifully, so.

The teacher must have taken notice because the next day, my class was sequestered in the resource room. The whole faculty in attendance. Faces I’d never seen before. Men in suits. All the adults in the room looking to each other for guidance and finding none made for awkward silence.

The big ass television on wheels from the A.V. room was rolled in. Whatever the issue was, it needed to be seen to be explained.

The lights go out. A video goes up. A lone child, roughly our age, sits in a sterile room. Doctors in white coats take turns showing her things, puzzles to solve, tasks to complete.

She’s then moved to a second room to sit and observe as a control group is then asked to complete the same tasks. They did so flawlessly.

At the time, the video made little sense, but one word stuck out because it was repeated ad nauseam: Morphogenic fields.

Let me ask, how much are you worth to your parents? The answer, in my case, was the cost of a mortgage and the promise that I would be cared for.

I was pulled from school. Home-life. Moved to a facility. The rest of my life, now on rails.

I was to be an engine. Powering the entirety of the human race forward.

Trouble is, my instructor, he calls me a Blank. Too rare to let go, too stupid to make use of.

In truth: I could probably learn, but I’m non-compliant. Now, I exist solely to poison myself. Fill my head with the darker facets of humanity. A living archive of atrocity. Anesthetize myself to populace at large.

Maybe then they’ll let me go.",shortscarystories
"Today it was Duncan's first day at a new job, and he couldn't be more excited.

He woke up to the sound of the alarm, his face still itching from yesterday.  Their room was still dark, but he wanted to see the morning sun shine on his bedroom on this eventful day.

He quickly got out of his bed, disregarding his sleeping wife next to him, and ran to the window to let the light in. But as he opened his curtains and felt the warmth on his face, the pitch black room didn't get any brighter.

""Can you please close them? I want to sleep"" his wife said.


His eyes weren't working.


He couldn't see.


He was blind. 


This wasn't happening. This wasn't possible. Not today. How could he be so unlucky?


""Honey..."" he said

""What is it?""

He couldn't get the words out. He was in shock.

Silently, he reached for his eyes, just to feel holes where his eyeballs were supposed to be.


""My eyes are gone"" he told his wife, relieved. 

""Oh you big dummy"" she responded as she began searching.

""Oh honey, I though i had gone blind, it was really worrying""

""Here they are"" she said, cheerfully coming out from under the bed ""They must've fallen while you were sleeping. Here, let me do it""

""Oh, thank you so much"" he said as she started putting them where they belonged.

Slowly, his vision came back, and the beautiful face of his wife started to come into view.

""You're as beautiful as the day I met you, Emily"" he said playfully. 

""Oh,stop it 'Duncan', you're gonna be late"" she responded, imitating his tone.

""I know, i know""

He went to the bathroom and washed his face, put on his dark grey sut on, kissed his wife and ran downstairs to his living room.


There, two people were laying on the couch. 

""Goodbye Duncan, goodbye Emily"" he said as he kissed their foreheads.

Being in the state they were, they could barely react to his affection, just tilting their heads and trying their hardest to get up.

""No no no"" he said, putting them back on the couch ""It's ok, it's ok. We got it""

Letting a small cry out, they collapsed back on the couch. They could still feel everything. He made sure of it.

And after their brief interaction, he cheerfully skipped to the door, looked back at his house, got out and went to his car, ready to start the day. 

Today it was Duncan's first day at a new job, and he couldn't be more excited.",shortscarystories
"My greatest scientific achievement was creating an environment where ghosts could be seen clearly. Unfortunately, funding ran short as the public found the eerie gaunt faces of the deceased disturbing. I knew I had to keep the project alive. I was able to lure in a few private benefactors with a strange promise. Imagine a ghost fight club if you will. A simple concept, get a few ghosts trapped in the same area and pit them against each other. Surprisingly, trapping them and filling the area with the right frequencies and electromagnetic pulses were producing a remarkable result. The investors were thrilled. But they wanted more, they wanted specific ghosts to fight. Hitler vs Churchill, you name it, I wasn't sure if that were possible. But the money was too good, they'd fund the project indefinitely if I could find a way to find famous ghosts, and torment them in my lab.

I should have stopped then. But the idea was tempting, with the new funds my equipment was powerful. I tried everything technology and my knowledge of the otherworld could do. I came across a young medium who claimed to be able to consistently reach out for other's loved ones. She ran a small business and somehow made a living doing this. I tested her myself and was impressed. I made her an offer and she accepted, this was the missing element I needed on the project.

Soon, we were having success after success. But she could only bring in people with some connection to the crew members. We had to keep our loved ones contained with the other group of ghosts. Confinement didn't seem to be an issue for the ghosts at first. The longer they stayed trapped, the more the torment became apparent. They seemed to grow in strength gradually from the field holding them. We started hearing them scratching, trying to get out. There was a disembodied wailing emanating from the area. The crew abandoned ship after this.

One night, working alone, trying to keep the machinery operational. I heard my name being called. I was too scared to turn, worried the field had failed. I sat there frozen, I could still hear them crawling and screaming. They were confined I told myself, finally looking towards them. The ghost's eyes will haunt me the most. They were damn near opaque by now. One of them had clawed free, my old friend. He looked at me with such a horror about him, I knew he would kill me if it were possible.

The lights flickered out. I wanted to scream but I was frozen solid, unable to move, dread grasping me. They popped back on with a small crackle of electricity. The ghosts were gone the room completely still and silent. Why arent they wailing? I thought. Why arent they scratching? In a moment of increasing panic, I screamed louder than I knew I could scream, the field had failed. I'd lost containment.",shortscarystories

"It was a cold night , me and my brother had just moved in to a new apartment , not being able to afford new furniture yet we slept on air mattresses on the floor and the first night in a new house or apartment feels lonely no matter how many people are in the house. 
And during that first night trying to sleep . I was woken by a sound I’ve never heard before . Now I was young and of course on edge from the Darkness and the sounds . But assuming it was just my mind playing playing tricks I tried to forget about it. But it lingered on and got louder.
Now at this point it wakes my brother up too . 
This noise sounded like a swinging rope , and a heavy rope at that.
Anyways this sound only comes at night and goes on for a few days. 
So finally we get the nerve to ask our landlord if we can do some stuff to the place
. We start tearing down the wall closest to this sound and the first thing we see inside this huge opening in the wall is a pair of shoes and glasses and a coat.
But then we look up...to see a noose hanging from the railing.
Shoes and noose but no remains. 
We went to tell the landlord and he called the cops and they took care of the stuff in the walls but a few years later as im writing this in my home . I hear a rope",shortscarystories
"

My mom is the owner to a cleaning company so when a building gets a complaint about the cleaning service she has to go the the building herself to check on the areas where the complaints were made. This story took place in a car dealership when I was around twelve or so.

My mom received a complaint about a missing trash bag in one area of the mechanics(this building had two areas one of the mechanics and one where they actually sell and display the cars) my mom told me to check the area where the complaint was, since we used to clean there I knew my way around the place, while I was walking down the long hallway I saw a shadow figure moving quickly down the hallway and disappear behind a car,the mechanic area is pretty big and the car that it disappeared behind was in the middle of the hallway and it takes like close to 3 mins to fully walk down the mechanic area. When I finally got to the car a minute later I looked around and saw that there was no one and nothing there, there was no person still walking down the hallway there was nothing. 

I was twelve so my mind was going crazy but I calmed myself by saying”oh, it was probably just one of the guards”  ,back when we used to clean that building there was guards there every night. So I just dismissed it and checked on the place where the complaints were and finished the night off.

When my mom and I were driving back home I mentioned to her what had happened and her expression quickly turned into a worried one.
“Are you sure about what you saw?” She asked me with a concerned look
“Yeah, why?” I replied getting increasingly scared
“It’s just that the guards had got fired two weeks ago there was no guards present tonight”
Total shock filled my body as I realized that what I had saw was not a guard but an actual ghost. My mom then explained to me that I wasn’t the only one that has seen something in the mechanic area, all the previous cleaning crew reported feeling like they were being watched or even the rooms getting cold out of nowhere. Since then I have never been able to return to that building out of fear that I will see that spirit ghost or entity again.",shortscarystories
"Shay was home alone, in her grandmother’s old rickety house. She hated this place, the cold wind breathed through the house when it blew. The floorboards creaked when you stepped on them and the windows shook with the wind as well.

&amp;#x200B;

The intermittent rattling and whispering from the gales was aggravating. It bothered her, and somehow headphones didn’t block out the noise. Plus, it was cold.

&amp;#x200B;

Grumbling, she switched to the next video. It was a flashy music video, dancers crossing the luminescent stage. It was quite a contrast to her surroundings, and she was hopeful that it would keep out the gloom.

&amp;#x200B;

It didn’t really, but she could pretend.

&amp;#x200B;

Her headphones suddenly cut out, much to her annoyance. The cord refused to respond, the video cracking with bursts of static across the screen. She growled in frustration. Her phone shouldn’t be acting like this, how could it?

&amp;#x200B;

In the gloomy house, she heard the whistle and rattle ever stronger. It was even worse without the music playing. She was nervous for a minute, but quickly lapsed back into moody frustration.

&amp;#x200B;

“Ugh! This stupid phone!” She shouted, her voice echoing through the old house. “I just want to play my music!”

&amp;#x200B;

The wind blew with ferocity, like a beast trying to get in. She cowered, but thought it was strange how it sounded like a voice. It continued to howl, roaring against the old boards and getting clearer and clearer.

&amp;#x200B;

*“music?”*

&amp;#x200B;

It reached her ears, and she looked up. The voice became quiet through the broken boards, a quiet question. Shay shivered as it spoke again with the same tones.

&amp;#x200B;

*“do you want music?”* The whispering sweet voice asking plaintively.

&amp;#x200B;

“uhm…” It occurred to her that her mischievous brother would take any chance to scare her. Looks of fear shifted to annoyed smirks as she stood up.

&amp;#x200B;

“Yea, sure. I’ll take your music.” She grumbled into the cavernous rooms.

&amp;#x200B;

*“Ahhh, good soul.”* it spoke, and a tinkling tone began to echo. It was like a music box and a chorus in one sound. It was soothing and catchy as it rang in her ears. She sat on the couch, her phone still writhing with static. Still, she sat and listened to the tune with a soft smile and her eyes closed.

&amp;#x200B;

When she opened her eyes, a mockery of a girl stood on the stairs. Its white skin curled and twisted like gnarled tree roots around its head and arms. A long nightgown hid its legs, but he could see lumps where its warped skin protruded out. Its black hair spiraled out into fin-like crests around its head. Large shiny black eyes stared endlessly at her relaxed form.

&amp;#x200B;

Shay screamed as it floated down to her, clutching the edge of the armchair. She was frozen, hearing music box tunes ringing in her ears instead of screams. The creature clutched her throat, and stole her life.

That next night, it lurked again. Breathing through the window a single word.

" I banged on the wall, I tried yelled something but I soon found myself dizzy to do that.

I tried to form a thought but it was really hard.

I tried to move but noticed that my movement was restricted by something.

I heard people laugh, it was soft but I could still hear them laughing. Why were they laughing?

Was it because I was locked up in here?

I tried to scream but my body involuntarily gasped for air instead.

I heard muffled music playing too, what the hell were they doing?

As I was slowly becoming aware of my surroundings I recognized the song.

*Unravel*.

My favourite song, why were they playing it?

The people kept laughing while I was panicking.

I could practically sing along with the lyrics, why were they playing it?

The song, the one that always managed to make me cry.

Yet the people were laughing, why?

How could they do this? Lock me up and play my favourite song.

The song I wanted them to play at my…

Oh god…

They’re not sobbing…

"I loved spending nights at Uncle Stephen’s growing up. I suffer from some mental health issues and unlike my parents he treated me like normal. He was a single man with no kids, but we didn’t have a lame father-son type bond, more like a big brother. 

Uncle Stephen would let me drink soda, play video games, watch R rated movies and stay up well past bedtime. It was a kids paradise, but it all changed after I spent my first night at his new home. 

Uncle Stephen ordered pizza and we watched the movie ‘Poltergeist’. He joked with me that he had gotten this house for so cheap because it was haunted. He always liked to fuck with me like that and it always worked. 

I was squirming in bed trying to forget the movie when I heard it. It sounded like a faint groaning, a muffled sound in the night. It seemed to be coming from my closet and after seeing that movie, I was scared out of my mind. 

The sound felt like it was on a playback loop. Moments of deafening silence followed by the groan like sound. Over and over. My legs felt like jelly and my pillow case was drenched in sweat. All I could do was squeal out “hello?”.

My voice must have traveled because my uncle came into the room and asked if I had called. I was 11 now. I didn’t want to look like a wimp and with my mental health problems, I didn’t want to look crazy. After some prodding, I told my uncle about the noise in the closet and he playfully teased me about picking a comedy next time. 

He went to the closet and I could hear him poking around and mumbling to himself. He told me the coast was clear, but he would bring in an exterminator soon to check for critters. And even the ghostbusters to check for ghosts. 

Maybe it was just the comfort of my uncle relaxing my mind, but the sound stopped and I slept well. That is until my next sleepover. It was like deja vu. Same sound, same periodic pauses. But when my uncle would check it would all cease. 

Again and again we would repeat this ritual every time I slept over. I was always grateful to my uncle though. He never lost patience with me, he would always perform the closet check and put my mind at ease until I could sleep. 

Uncle Stephen recently passed away and his house sold immediately at auction. However, the couple who bought the home tried to void the purchase after inspection. They fear that the house could be haunted.

A room that didn’t appear in the blueprints was discovered behind the closet wall. An emaciated corpse discovered inside.",shortscarystories
"My father and I were really close until he met Bertha. Once they got married, I became their enemy.
 
Bertha was extremely abusive. She was particularly obsessed about my weight. With my mother out of the picture I was hopeless. ""You are deformed"" she would say. 

So, I left as soon as I turned 18. I never saw my father again. He never knew I joined the military. He was not there when I got married or when I graduated college. I don't think he ever looked for me. Not if Bertha could help it.  

Now Bertha is in her 50s. Still pretty although an older version of the same abusive gold digger.

She did not recognize me when I asked her for help at the mall. Just another pretty lady shopping for lingerie and shoes. 

She did not seem to panic when I asked her to get into my car in the parking lot. ""I can give you a ride back to the mall sweetie, no problem.""

She barely fought when I injected her with the sedative and incapacitated her. 

She found herself tied to an old bed, in an old house. I feed her every day. She knew she would be severely punished if she refused to eat. Lard and more lard. Eat or be punished. 

After a few months my dad stress got to him and he had a heart attack. Some say he died of a broken heart. I made sure people in his town gossiped about Bertha and how she left for another man. 

I keep feeding Bertha every day. She was feisty at the beginning but after a while she started to shut down. Her body was swollen. Her face was grotesque, and she smelled. 

When the time came, I got close to her face and uttered the last words she would hear: ""You are deformed"". 

She looked at me and saw the little girl she used to abuse. She finally realized who I was and what was coming to her.

After I strangled her, I poured the drano on top of her body, covered her with plastic bags and construction debris.

I walk to the hospital and the screams got louder and louder till they just stopped.  I looked around for signs of anyone or anything but it was just me.

I fought my hardest to break free but the thing had a tight grip on me.

"“Creepy crawlies.” That’s what we called them because it was the only name that stuck. The media would call them, “the bugs”. Scientists only had an acronym, OPOs. 

But we knew better. We had always known that they were there. We had always felt them. 

Crawling around. Inside our bodies. 

It was just that they had finally hatched.

They came from us. They poured out of our mouths and noses, from beneath our fingernails and eyelids. Many of us would die from suffocation. Those who did were the lucky ones. 

The unlucky ones stayed conscious. 

Nobody could understand why or how this was possible. 

Specimens were collected. Tests were run and rerun and re-rerun. Reports were passed back and forth between specialists, but nobody could wrap their heads around them. 

None of that really mattered though. Not to those who experienced it first hand. 

All they wanted was for it to stop. 

Some would kill themselves. Others took their loved ones and friends, and even complete strangers, with them. Bodies littered the streets and hung from streetlights and sat in idling cars. 

Death was the only way out.

"The rain began pelting down as I took the shopping from the car. As I ran for the house the paper bags melted and before I knew it. the shopping was all over the floor. 

I screamed for my husband Mike to come and help me. My husband just stood there on the porch shrugging his shoulders. 

""I think you got it, love. There's no point in the two of us getting wet, "" said Mike as he squirmed at the sight of the rain. 

""Good for nothing bastard,"" I thought to myself, ""

 As I tried to grab what shopping I could a pair of leather boots appeared in front of me.

""May I help you,"" said a voice from above. I looked up to be greeted by a tall, older gentleman in a suit fit for an undertaker. He was bald-headed with thin lips and dark circles around his eyes. 

I stood up to greet him and put my hand out to shake his. He was a strange man, but there was something about him an almost calming presence radiating from him. 

""You're heavily burdened aren't you, my dear."" I looked down at the shopping on the floor. Well, it's only a small bit of shopping, no big deal, "" I laughed. 

The man looked at me with a faint smile, ""I don't mean the groceries, "" he said as he looked back at the house. 

It was like he could see deep into my soul and he could see my deepest secrets and desires.

He leaned in close and whispered something in my ear and by the time I waved him goodbye I couldn't remember what he said to me.

Mike was angry at me for taking so long with the shopping. He wanted to bash me hard in the mouth. But something stopped him.

""I'll fucking deal with you later, ""

I sat downstairs daydreaming of a better life as my bastard husband soaked in the tub. 

I sat there in a trance as the words the man whispered in my ear began floating around my head. 

""You can have anything you desire. All you have to do is kill your husband. 
 
Before I knew it, I was standing over my husband as he laid in the tub. The music from the stereo he had plugged in next to him was blaring.

"I found out what happened when I looked up from a cup of lukewarm coffee to see a familiar building on the screen of the break room television, a news ticker scrolling across the bottom of the broadcast to pump out a bold string of attention-grabbing words with a gruesome sense of urgency. It took only two for my stomach to drop and my heart to pound thickly in my chest and my head to swim with a sudden dizziness that struck me somewhere between stunned disbelief and indescribable dread.  

*Active shooter.*

“Hey.” A voice that sounded a million miles away clamped a hand on my shoulder. “That's not where your wife works, is it?” 

I wish I could say that the rest was a blur, but I remember it all with tormentous clarity. I remember the sound of my mug shattering on the floor, I remember how I gripped my keys so tightly as I ran through the parking garage that they bit into the flesh of my palm like metal teeth, I remember the angry blaring of car horns and the screeching sound of tires coming to a halt while I surged through traffic with a complete lack of caution. The whole time I never stopped calling her. I called so many times that each ring felt like a drill making its way through my skull, but she never answered—not when my shaky hand dialed her number as I stood transfixed before the TV, not when I tore free from my daze and raced to her office, and not when I pulled up to the wail of police sirens and the red flash of ambulance lights. I saw her coworkers; some were embracing, blood stains blotched across their clothes and shock etched into their faces as they wept, while the wounded were bandaged by paramedics or rushed away on stretchers. 

But I didn't see her. 

It took fifteen years to build our marriage, and just one bullet to end it. 

In the days following her funeral, when the grief became so consuming that not even the sleeping pills helped, I decided to visit a coworker that was still hospitalized. My reasons were selfish: I had done nothing but obsess over what her final moments had been like and wondered if he could tell me something, *anything*, that might answer the questions leaving me lying awake at night in a bed that now felt cold and empty. 

“We were hiding in a closet,” he whispered, visibly pained by each word, his body a labyrinth of tubes and gauze. “She had a hand clamped over her mouth and I held my breath listening to his footsteps going up and down the office. I don't think he knew where we were. Finally I heard the sound of a doorknob turning from across the room, like he was about to leave, and then...” 

“And then what?”

“Hi!”

“How was your day, kiddo? I missed you.”

“Good!”

“Let me ask you somethin’, alright?”

“Okay.”

“Did you make a lot of noise while Daddy was gone?”

“No, why?”

“Well, when I arrived home there were two or three of ‘em people outside who kept sneakin’ ‘round my property like it was their damn business.”

“Oh.”

“Y’know, Daddy was almost taken from you again. And I’m sure that you wouldn’t want that at all, hey?”  


“No, Daddy.”

“They’ve got a van parked right outside thinkin’ their real sneaky or somethin’, so I’ve gotta deal with those lunatics before they draw any more attention. But did you finish your chores while Daddy was gone?”  
“Yeah. I did the dishes, even the ones from yesterday. And I even put them all away, exactly how you wanted, Daddy.”

“I did that too. They’re all folded in your drawer.”

“Yeah, I did everything that you asked me to do, Daddy.”

“Yeah.”

“Well, good boy Jake! It seems as though you’ve finally learned how things work around here.”

“Yeah, but-”

“But Daddy, I wa-”

“Dammit Jake, just get to work before Daddy gets mad again like yesterday, okay? And I’m sure that you don’t want that, do you?”

“No Daddy, but m-”

“What now, Jake?”

“Did you see my Mommy today?”

“No...why? Did you see her coming for you?”

“She said that she was here, to come get me.”

“When?”

“Today. When you were at work.”

“What else did she tell you?”

“She said that she looked for me everyday since the day that I was taken from her, and that she’d come take me home when you went to go talk to the people outside. So can I go see her?”

“Jake...”

“Yes, Daddy?”

“Where is she right now?”

“She said that she’d be hiding in the backyard behind the shed.”

“Dammit, Jake! Stay here while Daddy goes and talks to her, alright?”

“Wait! But I want to-”

“Just sit here and shut up, okay? This situation is already screwed and we don’t need to cause any more suspicion.”

“Okay.”

“Yes, Daddy?”

"I’m loathed in this land. It’s scary that they have my identity, but I knew that was a risk when I started this. I can’t contain myself though, I feel a compulsion to get as many kids as possible.

Street justice is the law of the land here. No police and no trials. That makes it all the more dangerous, but so well worth it. I use any tactic to lure the children away. Candy, money, games. Anything to make sure they sneak away with me. The younger ones are easier to take. They’re so innocent, so simple to convince. I sometimes fear the older ones will alert someone and get me killed. But I still approach them and try. And once I lure them away, I make sure they never return. 

One child was returned actually. I’ll never forget him, little Jonathan. Such a beautiful little boy, so much potential. But I was reckless. I should have been watching him at all times, I should have made sure we made it to a discreet location first. I always wonder if I’ll see him again. Do I try and take him again if I do? Surely he’ll have constant eyes on him, I wouldn’t be able to get close. But I would still have to risk it. I came so close last time. 

Signs with the mocking title ‘Pied Piper’ plaster  the streets. Bounties put on my head. I constantly change up my appearance and travel with forged identification just in case I’m ever stopped by the many soldiers patrolling the area. It’s futile however, I know if they ever stop me I’m a dead man.

I always think I should flee the country. Go to another part of the world where I’m not known. Where I can continue to take the children with less risk. But I feel the need to stay here. I’ve seen too many of the children here to forget them and walk away.

So at night I fill my pockets with candy and I continue to go on the prowl. And I’ll continue this ritual until I’ve taken all the children away from them.

Because I’ve buried too many child soldiers here and I won’t stop until it does.",shortscarystories
"There was nothing peculiar about this farm. The pigs were genetically bred to be hungry - *always*. Insatiable, ravenous - *“as greedy as a pig”*. That was the way Leonard bred his pigs and that was the way he liked it. He’d run the farm for 25 years this way and he knew the fatter the pig, the bigger the yield of bacon. It’s how all pig farms are run. 

“Whatever happens. Do not let the pigs get hungry.” Leonard had told Raymond on his first day. The words stuck with Raymond and anytime he fed them, he knew this was one of the days’ most important tasks. 

Lionel was Raymond’s favourite pig. Lionel was the biggest, eldest and smartest. Whenever Raymond threw down the slop; Lionel was the one forcing his way through to the front of all the other pigs and greedily eat everything. 

*Quite a character this pig is*  \- Raymond would think. 

Raymond’s weakness was whiskey and in the six months working at Leonard’s farm, he wasn’t sober a damn day. Not that he gave a shit, he was there to work the land, have fun and *make sure the pigs don’t get hungry.* 

It wasn’t until Eric came over with some moonshine did things go sour… 

Raymond was used to whiskey, Raymond could handle whiskey but moonshine just wasn’t a friend to Raymond. 

“Come on. Just one won’t hurt.” Eric said. 

*Well it wasn’t just one was it. It never is just one…* 

Hours/days (maybe even a week!) later waking up in a face-full of vomit - Raymond committed the ultimate sin. 

***He let the pigs get hungry.*** 

Pulling back the barn door - the first thing Raymond could smell was that metallic scent. Blood everywhere. Pig blood. The pigs had turned cannibalistic in their hunger. Huge open, festering wounds littered amongst the dead carcasses. *They’d eaten through the skin of their own kind.* And there, amongst the rib cages and pork-flesh was half a human hand, that green emerald ring he knew so well. It was Leonard’s hand - the flesh eaten to the core of the bone. 

***Do not let the pigs get hungry.*** The words rang true. 

“Eric you son-of-a-bitch!!” Raymond screamed. 

But Eric was gone. You see, Eric owned the neighbouring pig-farm. Eric knew what happened when the pigs went hungry. Eric hid behind a facade of being drinking-buddies but Eric never touched a drop. Raymond cursed himself for being so *fucking* weak. 

And as he trawled through the wreckage of dead pig after dead pig, climbing over the odd piece of skin probably belonging to Leonard - he saw the slop bucket - *dry as a bone.* 

Behind him he heard a harsh breath of air - snorting!  

And there he was - the alpha pig - ***KING*** ***Lionel*** in all his glory, looming large. There was a greedy rocket in Lionel’s eyes. A longing. A hunger. A ravenous, uncontrollable appetite. 

And Raymond was next… This was how the pigs were bred.",shortscarystories
"Silver is a vampire.

We, the kids in North Haven. are sure of it.

The pale girl that had moved from Blackside City with her parents is really suspicious.

First off, she talks to no one and she rarely smiles.

However Josh told us that he knew why she never smiles.

She has super sharp teeth, he saw it!

That’s the reason she keeps her mouth shut, otherwise everyone could see it.

Second, the moment she showed up in town, cattle would be found dead or bleeding out.

The farmers claimed it was a wolf or a bear but we all know better.

Silver did it.

Of course you can’t see her red eyes but she has contact lenses that hide her real eyes.

We saw it, when we peaked at her in the bathroom we saw her take out those lenses.

But that’s not even the biggest piece of evidence.

No, we spend entire nights outside her house to study her.

Sometimes Silver leaves the house in the middle of the night, and when she comes back she’s covered in blood.

And wouldn’t you know it, the next morning they found  a sheep lying in a pool of blood.

That’s when Josh, Sammy and I decided to take action.

Sammy brought wooden stakes to pierce her heart while Josh and I had brought garlic and holy crosses.

When both her parents went away for date night we snuck into her house.

Johnny was nervous but Sammy and I were brave and took the lead.

We quickly found our vampire sleeping in her bed.

The room was completely dark, the perfect lair for a vampire.

We sneaked our way towards her bed untill Johnny gulped.

To loud, Silver woke up and stared at us.

I lowered my stake intending to strike the vampire’s heart but she deflected it.

“Garlic!” I yelled as Sammy stumbled with the garlic.

Johnny grabbed one of the crosses and held it in front of us.

Checkmate.

Silver stared at the cross in Johnny's hand, was that disbelieve on her face? Fear?

It was really hard to see in the dark.

She started suddenly screaming in pain, her body started quivering and I could see fear on her face.

“Holy shit,” Sammy gasped, “She really is-”

“Die you vampire!” I yelled.

My stake swung down and was about to hit her in the heart but last moment it was caught by a hairy paw.

I stared at the Silver in confusion, which only grew even more when Silver began to growl at us.

“What the-” I tried to say but before I could finish the sentence she jumped towards my throat.

As she passed the moonlight that shone through the window I no longer saw a girl.

Instead I saw a wolf.",shortscarystories

"It had been a short day for one Dr. Martin Griffiths, DDS. A few quick check-ups here, a filling there, and there was only one appointment left for the day, a wisdom tooth extraction. The patient had arrived early, and despite her anxiety over the process, was now calm and under the numbing effects of a Novocain shot. Careful not to make her jolt, Griffiths slowly guided his drill over to the offending tooth, gently tapping at it to start cutting it apart, to no effect. He started to apply more pressure on the tooth, and suddenly the patient convulsed, forcing Griffiths to quickly turn off the drill. The patient said she felt something moving inside her gums, as if the drilling had agitated something under the tooth. Figuring it was simply a nerve that the tooth was pressing on, Griffiths opted for a different approach.

As the patient calmed down, he grabbed a set of pliers and slowly clamped them onto the tooth. He began pulling, gently at first, as he felt the tooth give and start coming out. He closed his eyes and kept pulling, knowing the tooth was definitely coming out. He opened them when he heard the patient scream, or as much as she could wearing the mouth guard. As he looked down at his work, his skin went pale as chalk. The tooth was there, still held between the pliers, but attached to it, and leading down into the poor girl's mouth, were multiple toothlike segments, each with a pair of sharp legs blindly scuttling about in the air. The patient kept screaming, trying to break free of the straps and grab ahold of her mouth. In haste, Griffiths gave another tug, and slammed the writhing mass of bloody segments and legs onto the tray. It was only then that he saw the black fangs that had come out of the other end, the antennae wriggling furiously about, and then a white blur as the Centipede before him lunged forward.

&amp;#x200B;

A few nurses, overhearing the commotion, burst through the door to a horrifying sight. Slumped over in a chair, Dr. Griffiths lay dead with two puncture marks in his cheek. Beside him, a trail of blood seemed to lead into the mouth of the unconscious patient. As the nurses looked into her mouth, they saw her wisdom tooth, slightly bloodied, but nestled securely in her gums.",shortscarystories
"Elliot, the caretaker of the McLean estate, searched for his Lord’s son, Kris. They were the only occupants of the home. Mr. and Mrs. McLean had gone to study recently uncovered artifacts in China, and left Elliot in charge of their fourteen-year-old boy.  

Kris, an inquisitive lad, immediately set to pillaging his father’s study, in search of the strange and wondrous volumes he knew were stored in the erudite man’s office. After several drawers were withdrawn and their contents carelessly spilled about the floor, Kris finally found one of the mysterious tomes he sought.  

The book, a thick, dust-covered thing, was bound in a dark leather, and emblazoned with a gold emblem of a Lamia on its cover. Words of a language unknown to Kris titled the book’s face and spine, in the same gold décor as the symbol. Something about them seemed strangely familiar, as if the formation of the bizarre lettering held some personal significance; some nigh-recognizable meaning concealed within the alien script. 

Kris, surged with a youthful excitement, opened the volume and studied the contents therein. After an hour, he returned the book to its drawer, tidied up his father’s study, and left the room in the same state it had been before his arrival.  

McLean manor was a sprawling, ancient building, with intersecting corridors, hidden rooms, and long-forgotten passageways which opened up to the grounds through moss-covered portals and other peculiar avenues.  

Kris, knowledgeable of most of these tunnels in the labyrinthine estate, often used them to inconspicuously travel throughout his home during nighttime adventures. 

In one of these hidden rooms, Kris performed the ritual detailed in his father's book. He made the required symbols on the floor with his blood, which he had drawn from a wound painlessly made in his palm. He snipped a lock of his coal-black hair, burned it, and spoke the incantation whose invocative words he did not understand, but spoke nonetheless.  

The only objects in the room were a couch—on which he had seated himself—and a stone bowl, in which burned the fire, and around which the symbols had been drawn. 

It was when the flame’s mounting blaze turned a sinister purple that Elliot burst into the room, eyes wide at the burgeoning terror. The wicked flame grew, and reached the low ceiling of the room, where it then spread like a devilish root—painting the grey stone walls a hellish black.  

A ghastly voice spoke:  

“You’ve done well, boy. Your father, my son, imprisoned me in that book years ago. He feared my power, refused to inherit my extramundane knowledge. But now **you** shall, and together we will unmake this world.”  

The flames were then drawn towards Kris and harmlessly entered his flesh, as if he were a conduit of Hell. Kris fell limp, and Elliot ran to him. Upon placing a hand on Kris's shoulder, he was immediately set ablaze.  

Kris awoke, instilled with eldritch power, and walked through the wholly-ashen figure that had once been Elliot. ",shortscarystories
"Come forth and visit

My forest today 

There is lots to see

But when you're here

Watch out your fears

And what they've come to be

Beware the butterflies

They've been known to bite

You'll see their skull covered wings

Animals eat

What falls at their feet

With blood covered voices

They'll sing

Dead berries and fruit

Grow under the shade 

From teeth that bloom like seeds

Branches and vines

Will reach out and find

They strangle with fingers of weeds

If after all this

You still wish to find

The woods of which I tell

Search out for the trees

And speak this simple spell",shortscarystories
"It was late at night. I was watching a movie on Netflix, my brother was asleep, and my sister was listening to music. I didn't think much of it, but my neglect was her death.

The next morning, my sister woke up with a terrible cough. It lasted for three whole weeks before we decided to take her to the hospital.

The doctors spent hours and hours trying to find out what was wrong. They found out she had a disease called Aspritix. A fatal disease that makes the size of a lung shrink or even explode.

Only three cases of Aspritix were found before her, and the doctors asked what she was doing the night before,  and we told her she did nothing unusual, other than listening to music, something she doesnt normally do.

We checked her phone, and there it was. A song name Aspritix. And the service she was using showed users how many times listened to it, and it said three.

I couldn't sleep last night, knowing it was MY fault for her death.",shortscarystories
"Why I subject myself to these things, there’s no good answer. I’m beginning to fear we exist solely to feed our own anxieties.

A while back, someone upturned a digital rock: Unearthing an oddity. We networked around it, like slime mold, creating a following. Trying to puzzle out one user on an upload service going by Iamus.

IAMUS: I. Am. Matthew. Uriah. Sadowski

In passing, the videos wouldn’t have seemed of note. That anyone sat through footage enough to pick up on anything out of sorts is curious of itself. Tens of hours. Just Matt. Alone in a dingy apartment.

Still, we watched.

And I wish I didn’t. Because it feels as though a rug has been pulled—revealing a thin glass floor to unimaginable depths.

Matt was candid, perhaps too much so, revealing where he lived—alone, in a small city in the Midwest. Worked— a retail outlet, pushing carts, SSI checks to supplement his income.

Disheveled. Strung-out. Low impulse control seemed to factor into his mental state. Always smoking/drinking something. Anything he could get his hands on. Time-lapse. You could witness his face running gaunt.

A space heater and desk fan were both close and always running. Music playing in the background. Matt had a desperate need for constant stimuli. All at once.

Obsessive viewers even noted that if you froze and zoomed in, you could see the reflection of his monitor in a picture frame on the wall just behind his head. Multiple windows opened and tabbed. He was watching his own videos. On repeat.

Lines blurred. We were looking in on this very private closed-door thing.

Speculation abound: Substance abuse, paranoid schizophrenia, bipolar hypomania.

Timestamps were compiled.

At 31:24 in a video titled “My Upbringing,” Matt pauses in his monologue about how his dad left him and mother at a young age, blaming himself, believing it was due to his “condition”, to stare off into space. This lasts for more than a moment. Nodding intently. As if he were listening to someone. The camera’s view covered everything save for the bath. Kitchen, living space, and bed—all one room. There was nothing and no one.

After five minutes of zoning out, Matt snaps back, as if from a trance, grabs a thumbtack off the desk, drives it into the meaty part of his hand. The video ends there.

Pause for concern. The community was split.

54:17: “The Quiet,” Matt would explain his behavior, saying that he believes if he stops, for even a second, he will cease to exist. That there’s a “lull” in his head that will swallow him up if he doesn’t keep occupied.

There have been murmurs on message boards. People saying the more they watch, the more uneasy they become when still. Folie à Deux, perhaps.

But the more I watch, waiting for his next upload, it’s becoming increasingly more difficult to get out of my own head. As if there’s this great wall of silence rushing towards me I can’t outrun.",shortscarystories
"James pondered aloud, as he stared out the gym window.  He knew it was cold and snowy out, but a bear in Minnesota?!?  Not possible.

He glanced around the workout floor for some compatriot for affirmation.  He spotted a large figure far across the room.

“Hey Buddy!  Come here and take a look!  Is that a bear out there?”

His gym companion snorted, perhaps in derision, perhaps in surprise.  He did not, however, approach James, who breathed in frost from the icy panes.  *Why was this gym so cold, anyway?* *I’m shivering instead of sweating*!

“Hey, Pal!” he tried again.  “Come check this out!  Am I hallucinating or what? It’s not that cold in here!”  He chuckled, rubbing his hands together and already feeling warmer.

The figure finally turned and lumbered in his direction.  *Geez, that guy is huge!* he thought.  *Must be twice my size...*

James held his ground as the intimidating body approached him, but it wasn’t stopping and was soon right in James’ face, reeking breath fogging his glasses.  James tried to step back, only to find himself  rooted in place, seemingly on his knees.  With trembling hands roaming the remains of his tattered arctic sled, he had only a brief moment of clarity before the polar bear’s jaws closed.",shortscarystories
"“A civil war,” the Major told his soldiers, “is when a brother kills his brother, a father his daughter, a son his father”.

He had his reasons for those words. Years ago, the enemy had murdered his wife and stolen his only child. He had vowed eternal hatred.

He was the one who ordered his soldiers to arrest the girl early one morning. She was a teenager who wore her hair in pigtails that tumbled over her shoulders, and she stood accused of supporting the insurgents.

They took her to an abandoned warehouse where they punched and kicked her while the Major watched. He was a large man with red hair and a blue uniform. His mind was full of ideas of valour and heroism, even as he tortured unarmed girls.

Later they stood about her in a circle and beat her with iron pipes. They threatened to rape her. When, in pain and fear, she wet herself, they laughed at her.

She never spoke. Perhaps eventually they would have broken her, but her heart was weak; one moment she breathed and wept, the next she died.

Annoyed at the failure of his noble mission, the valorous Major ordered her body disappeared. The soldiers took her to a frozen field at night to bed her to rest with many of her comrades. They hacked a hole into the ground and in it placed her broken body.

The next day the Major gave another speech: how important it was, in days of such terrible necessities, to remain good and decent and honourable.

Not all the soldiers were convinced.

In the weeks that followed some were consumed by guilt. Thus they were easy prey for her: she only needed to appear in their dreams and they left their bodies willingly to follow her tumbling pigtails into the dark corridor into which she led.

Others were not so easily swayed; to them she manifested as an apparition of broken bones and bruised, swollen skin. Then they followed her too, for their guilt was too great for them. One by one, she took the soldiers.

But how to deal with a man such as the Major? Still the medals gleamed proudly on his wide chest. Still he believed in his honour and his righteousness.

And yet in the end, it was easy.

When almost all his men were gone, the Major came to the cold field at night to end the haunting, spade in hand. His heart was still proud; he sensed the truth but could not yet accept it.

It was only when he dug up the plastic bag in which she had been buried that the knowledge came to him as if whispered into his ear, suddenly and with terrible clarity, as such knowledge does. And he stood trembling in the field over the body, face in his hands.

A civil war is when –

"That rickety bus came to a stop about a mile away from home. Didn’t know what to expect; the bus driver was already 2 miles into know mine field territory. I grabbed my battle rifle, put on my helmet, and footed the last mile. The soldier in me just did what I was used to, looked for tell tale signs of recent movement, allied or otherwise, but there wasn’t anything.

But only part of me. Most of me was tired. Everything I did was an after thought, dull, subdued. What would it be like? There’s no place like home after all. Even if home was the target of a carpet bombing. I just needed rest.....

*snap*

I turned suddenly at the noise and let off several rounds, realizing just as quickly the dog I just killed was probably harmless. At least I think it was a dog......those larger calibers are just so powerful. I nonchalantly topped off my loaded ammo, and continued. 

All around, the scenes of destruction were evident, as large craters covered the streets, and missing gaps in the rows of houses left the charred husks of the residences that used to stand there before a guided bomb obliterated it and everything inside. More worrying were the shell casings......all calibers. But no bodies. At least not in sight......wait. That pile.....I ran to it. Sure enough, it was my neighbors. Oh my......where are my feelings? These are the people I lived with......well, I can’t tell who they are.....I should find home. There’s no place like home. 

Each step is heavier. I feel the pack I carried for 4 years get heavier, unbearably heavier. I slide it off. No point in keeping this gear; everything I need is at home. I can already see my wife, with a meal she cooked. Maybe my daughters will be home.....Maria is always so social with her little friends! Yes, they are hopefully home. I smile as I pass a red painted curb.....well, more brown. I guess the paint for fire lane has gone a bit bad. 

I passed another pile of something. Must be burned wood. Thin pieces too......one might even thing they’re bones! Oh my, my imagination is so fun sometimes......

Oh no, the fire hydrant is open! Good thing they turned the water off, that’s the only explanation for why there’s not water spouting out......

Finally! Home! I run up the walk, invigorated. 

“Nina! Maria! Lucia!” I yell. “I’m home!”

I run into the living room. It must be October, cuz there’s 3 skeletons in the room. My oh my! Ready for Halloween! The girls all loved Halloween! And these skeletons must be for decorating! Maybe we’ll get a fourth one, so there’s a family of skeletons......

......oh, I’m so tired.......I think......I’ll just lay down here for a while. I was so hungry and thirsty a bit ago.......not really anymore. I think......I’ll sleep. They’ll wake me up when they’re back. Home’s a little dreary sometimes......but there’s no place like home.

There is no such thing as fearing the darkness. Fearing the unknown? Sure. Being afraid of the ""Bloody Mary"" chants your friends make in the middle of the night in a pitch black bathroom? Go right fucking ahead. 

But don't ever disgrace my name, saying that you are *scared* of me.

Because I protected you all of these years. When you were five, crying to mommy and daddy about the monster under your bed that you couldn't quite see because it as too dark, you ordered them to look and see if they could catch a glance. They couldn't. It was too dark. Lucky for you the monster couldn't look at you aswell.

Or all the times you were in the shower thinking that there was someone right behind you. You were so sure of it. You tried to look at it through your peripheral vision but all you could see was the ever consuming blackness. 

I covered you, like an invisibility cloak. Like a mother that protects her children.

Short answer: no, you are not scared of the dark, you are afraid of what hides behind me.

So when you are scared of something and close your eyes, when the darkness welcomes you to your own ignorance, my advice...

The knock came again. Tom winced. He took a deep shaky breath and continued crawling through the tunnel. He didn't know where he was. He didn't know the time. He knew that he was in a tunnel, he knew that it was damp and dark, and he knew that he needed to stop when the knock came again.

*Tap... tap... tap*

Panic encroached on his mind. Tom struggled to hold his breath. *What is that?* he thought. He tried to imagine the source of the knocking. His mind filled with images of gnashing teeth and reaching tentacles. *Best not to think about that. Don't panic.*

*Tap... tap... tap*

He continued to crawl through the darkness. It felt real. The darkness seemed to be watching him. *Just claustrophobia,* he told himself.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

It was right above him now. He felt warmth as if a great engine were bearing down on him. He heard a deep sigh. He looked up, but- in the darkness- he saw nothing. He began to crawl again, but found he could not move. Something in the damp mud had caught him. He tried to pull away and pain retched through his body. He cried out, but the thing above him screeched so loudly it drowned out his cries. He did not see the mouth fall upon him then, but he did feel the teeth as they began to chew. Panic consumed him. He screamed out into the darkness and the darkness took him.

To the right of him, stood an intimidating dark forest. At night you'd be wary, but at daytime, when the sun hits the leaves, it just looks so beautiful.

The light blue sky, with little waves of clouds stretching across. It calmed him.

He was the only person there.

The man laid in a small warm pool, which widened over time. He had to lay there. What else could he do? With paralysis from the waist down, he would never get out. 

But the sound, he thought. 

The scenery was one thing, and then the sound. 
 
The awful wet gurgling noise that filled his ears.

The man slowly looked down, and there it was. The grass around his legs, soaked in blood. His neighbor was chewing off his thigh. He squinted.

"Lying is a fundamental thing humans do everyday.


People always say that the truth hurts. That no matter what, the truth shall set you free.


The truth has always been something that not a lot of us can deny and yet we sometimes want to deny it.


That's why we make stuff up and bury the truth with six feet of dirt.


That's why we change the story as to what it originally was.


That's why we deny the truth and find a way to lie and forget all about it.


No matter what, the truth will eventually show itself, yet, we still lie.


So why do we lie? Is there a good reason that we have to keep lying over and over and over again every single time?


Why do we still keep on pretending to ourselves and lie?


Not everyone knows as to what the reasons are that we lie.


In reality, finding out the truth is harder than trying to make a lie.


And I believe that somewhere, somehow or someone will tell you about who I really am.


But, will you believe it?",shortscarystories
"The sink faucet was leaking, the sound of water dripping echoed in Liam's ears. The awful noise sounding in his head over and over again, it was driving him insane.

He wanted to stop it, but nevertheless as much as he struggled the bounds on his hands and feet refused to budge. 

Liam had no idea how long he had been there, but hunger and thirst slowly become more and more painful. His vision blurs and his head pounds as he listens to the horrible sound.
 
He was sorry, he didn't mean to kill that woman. It had been dark and she was in all black, he had been tired... Liam would cry if he could the dripping water reminding him of the rain on that night, the night he crashed into a woman on the way home killing her.

Insanity slowly overtook him as he sat there alone and in the dark, that nightmare of a night replaying in his head along with that sound of water. 

This was it, this was hell, this was his hell. He was going to sit in that agony, that pain, that sorrow, that guilt, in that deserted highway rest stop. The same one he'd taken his life in for all eternity, suffering forever in his perfect hell.

It comes for us.

For everyone.

Aneurysm. Myocardial infarction. Hitting your head on the nightstand while you're putting your pants on, hopefully embarrassment isn't the last thing you feel.

My natural death would be cirrhosis. Call me an alcoholic but I don't think I am. I just hate being bored. Also, whiskey makes everything interesting.

I know my days are numbered but I've found redemption.

"**She was such a pretty girl.**

She had big eyes, pink cheeks, and hair that was soft and shiny. People said that this is what makes a girl beautiful. This is what made her.

It was tiring to be watched when she did what anyone else would. She always tried to do what anyone else would, but it was hard. The world had countless eyes. It was hard when the world stared, when they opened their mouths and said that she was such a pretty girl.

It was as if she was nothing else.

She’d say, “Thank you,” but that felt very silly. Only the people felt good about themselves, not her. For such a pretty girl, you’d think she would have some confidence - that was what her Mom said.

A few times, she replied, “I know,” but the people always frowned. That made her feel even worse. It was lonely being such a pretty girl.

One day she said, “Go away,” but that made her mom angry, and she never said it again.

Today there was a man who looked kind and just like the other man that helped them sometimes at the gas station. He smiled at her. “You’re such a pretty girl.”

Her mom was still in the grocery store. Her dolly was still inside the car. Her mom had forgotten to give her the keys to it.

“Thank you,” She said.

“I’d like to be your friend.”

“Really?”

He smiled even bigger. Suddenly, she was very excited. The people said compliments, but usually, they seemed too afraid to be her friend.

Now, the people said nothing at all.",shortscarystories

"I've woken again in the realm of pain. It is endless, this pain. There is no solace. There is no comfort. There is only suffering. And me. Only me. I suffer in solitude. But not for long.

The lights are fading in the other realm. I step through once more, emerging, as always, in the dark space with the hanging skins. My nails scratch at the door as I search for the doorknob. It squeaks, as always, when turned, just as the door always creaks when opened.

The room into which it opens is as dark as the space with the hanging skins. I shuffle into that darkness. The thing in the room has noticed. Its breath has quickened. I must find it before the light returns.

I try to speak—to croon, really—but, much like the door, my voice can only creak. It seems to frighten the thing in the room. The thing begins whispering, a welcomed act. I'm drawn to the sound like a beacon. I catch words in brief. ""Please,"" and ""God.""

I'm at the side of its resting place, gazing down upon it. It's so small. It’s eyes are clenched shut. I’m envious. If I had eyelids, I could keep from observing the torment wrought upon me; grant myself some reprieve in merely closing my eyes.

A strand of drool slides past my jagged teeth. It falls onto the thing in the bedding. An accident. I have no lips to refrain from from drooling, much like I lack the skin to keep from bleeding upon the floor.

I'm not certain it can understand this creaking voice but I thank it nonetheless. For its presence. For praying. ""I'd have never found you otherwise.""

It shrieks. The footsteps of the guardians approach. I reach out to grab the thing but it's too late. The other door bursts open and the light has returned.

I've woken again in the realm of pain. I was so close this time. So close to obtaining it: empathy. I will try again another time, when next the lights fade. I will share my pain.",shortscarystories

None of my friends do, nor do any of my coworkers. There’s no one forcing their religion on me or anything like that, I just believe. My friends laugh at me. My girlfriend thinks Im becoming a religion freak. Not a single one of them believes.

"Each day is a little bit better. 

I'm learning to cope without you. I'm training myself to remember the good times and focus on how we loved each other. This process brings tears to my eyes. 

Each day is a little bit better. 

The children will be fine. They're young and you'll be a distant memory. You've planned for our futures, and that thought brings tears to my eyes. 

Each day is a little bit better. 

From how we first met, to when we got married, to welcoming our children into the world, it will be so different without you. This future brings tears to my eyes. 

""Each day is a little bit better,"" she tells her therapist, exactly as practiced. She trained herself to cope properly by studying grieving widows. She maintained that she will be financially set by ensuring the legality of the will. She thought on their first encounter, their ""I do's"", and the children they raised thinking it'd save the relationship. 

She planned and trained and maintained focus, and just as everyone always responded, ""I'm so sorry for your loss. How are the children?""

""We're here for you.""

And now, almost free, I smile and say, ""Thank you,"" as this truly brings tears to my eyes.",shortscarystories
"The shadows on Mason’s wall were alive.

Every night he looked at the shadowy figures on the wall, first he was scared but he quickly learned that the shadow figures on the wall couldn’t hurt him.

They just stared at him while he slept, not that he was bothered by it.

Sometimes it was just one shadowy figure on the wall, sometimes two but rarely three.

He tried to talk to the shadowy figure but it seemed like they couldn’t.

He waved at them, sometimes the shadowy figure would wave back.

More often it would keep staring at him.

Until one special night.

The shadow figure became bigger and there were even more figures.

They slowly grew in size, Mason watched with interest as the shadowy figure was now big enough to fill the entire room.

Mason waved at the shadow.

"Sometimes I hate him.
The way he treats my mother, blatant disrespect right infront of my face. 
But this is the way its always been.
From my earliest childhood memory til now. Constant screaming, the degrading comments, an occasional punch or two (but dad always profusely appologized after these, along with the uncontrolled sobbing). 
I dont understand why mother allows him to treat her this way, she never defends herself or speaks back to my father. Apparently she was raised with the old fashioned husband-knows-best mentality.


As much as I despise my father and do not condone his behavior, I can understand where his anger may come from. He is the only one that works, cooks, cleans and the likes, and he isn't all bad to mother, for example, the house is freezing cold, I have pleaded with my father to turn on the heat but he wont allow it. Apparently mother needs it nice and cool and father abliges regardless of our discomfort.
Mother is a rather lazy individual, I don't recall a single instance of her leaving her room. Even on special days like my birthday for instance, she would just remain in her room silent, not even so much as a ""happy birthday"". Im not sure exactly what her issue is, and although I hate to admit it I do some what resent her for it. My father just caters to her and thats it, but I always ask myself, if you despise her so much and hate what she is doing to you...why stay? Why cater to her if she makes you so upset? Ive tried asking my father this but am quickly put in my place and dismissed immediately. The best answers I have gotten were ""you will understand one day"" and ""love is strange"" the latter being rather confusing because from what I see this relationship is in no way shape or form the definition of love. 


Some nights I am woken up by my fathers sobbing and barely comprehensible, questioning mutters to my mother ""why have you done this to us"" and ""why put this on me""?. I dont have a clue what he means and he wont ever tell me. I find it rather odd that father continues to talk to mother, she never answers, I havent in my lifetime been able to even get a peep out of her. All she does is hang there with that emotionless stare on her face.",shortscarystories

"My trek was going to take me fifteen miles away from the world. I’d taken this trip many times over the years, but the reds, greens, and oranges of the trees this time of year never failed to make me take a moment to just slow down. No emails, no technology. Just concentrate on natural beauty before you. A cool breeze rustled the trees as I strolled, as if bestowing affirmation. Refreshing. I had made good time, but got a late start and hadn’t even made it a third of the way there. Oh well.

I went about my business of setting down for the night. Sleeping bag out. Good supply of dry wood. S’mores. The essentials.

The fire crackled as I tended to it, the flames flickering to and fro. The night had gotten surprisingly chilly and it was a little windy. I was thankful for the fire. And the s’mores. I laid down and started counting stars. It was getting harder and harder to count them until the woman’s screams echoed through the trees.

I shot up. I scrambled for my backpack and pulled out my flashlight. My eyes darted around the darkness.

And I waited.

And I studied the darkness.

And I waited.

I strained my ears to hear something. Anything.

Silence there and nothing more.

Ten minutes gave way to thirty. I grew increasingly convinced that I might have been mistaken. The stress of the day began to reclaim me. My eyes began to droop. I tended the fire, laid back down and somehow managed to drift to sleep.

The woman’s screams echoed through the trees.

It was louder than before.

I leapt to my feet. My heart threatened to escape my chest. I quickly grabbed the flashlight and scanned my surroundings. What is it? What is that? There’s a normal reason for this. Normal. The chill in the air was biting. The wind that had caressed me earlier in the day began to howl. But I could still hear the cry in the darkness, now a constant, preternatural wailing. Oh God. My body screamed at me to go, but that’s how you get lost in the woods. And I can’t get lost. I managed to shout “hello” into the night as loud as I could.  Moments later, “hello” echoed through the trees.

Except it wasn’t my voice.

Scared as I was, I couldn’t turn my back on someone in danger. I ran headlong into the trees before terror could seize me.

Faster.
Faster.
Faster into the wood.

The wailing grew louder and clearer. The shapes of the dark grew less ambiguous. In the distance, the shape of a young woman gradually started to form as my flashlight illuminated her. Her face was bloodied and bruised. She was walking with a limp. But, otherwise, she seemed to be okay.

“Oh baby”, I cried, as a wave of relief washed over me, “you almost scared me to death! How did you chew through your collar?”",shortscarystories
"The lights in this room are off, but you see the lightswitch only a few feet away on the opposite wall.

When the door clacks shut behind you leaving you in the dark, you aren't alarmed. Knowing the light switch is a few steps away, you stick your hands out and walk towards the wall.

You walk the number of steps you knew you'd have to, and find nothing. Fear seizes your muscles, freezing you in place.

You reach out again, stretching blindly into the abyss. You were undoubtably being foolish to be so frightened. Just a little bit further, you were sure.

You stumble forwards, nothing stopping you as you lean forward. To hell with being sensible, you spin around and march quickly as you dare back to the door you entered through.

"The balloon arrived with a promise. It opened its cavernous mouth, and spoke in the voice of God. 

“Everything will get better,” it said. “Just follow me.”

We should’ve ran. We should’ve fled from it, screaming our heads off. There were a lot of things that we should’ve done. 

But all we did was listen. 

We were just too tired to care about such a thing as self-preservation. The world was going to Hell before our very eyes. Global warming. Political unrest. A never-ending cycle of school shootings and protests, police shootings and riots. Even a few mass suicides. 

Everything that could’ve gone wrong had gone wrong, and we all needed to escape. And the balloon had promised us an escape. 

It wouldn’t have mattered anyway. We moved without thinking. 

Thousands of people flocked to the middle of Times Square. The balloon hovered over us, watching its impromptu congregation with eyes bigger than a bus. They were brown and wet. 

It smiled a sweet, girly smile. 

Its blonde hair was whipped about. 

“Everyone will be happy now,” it whispered but didn’t whisper. “Just open wide.”

We did as we were told. Like the children that we were. Young and blind, and full of human ignorance. Following the authority of something we couldn’t hope to understand. 

We opened our mouths. The balloon opened its own. And what fell from the depths beyond our reach tasted… 

… sweet. 

Happiness. Joy. Pleasure. Contentment. Satisfaction with life. Everything that was good and right with the world, we were drowning in it. True bliss. Paradise. 

Everything else just melted away. 

We had finally escaped from our nightmare. 

By the time we saw the balloon’s sneer, the look of utter disgust on its face, it was already too late. 

Our throats started to burn.",shortscarystories

Me: Sorry did I interrupt you?

Alex: No, I was just listening to music

Me: Okay, by the way here is your money 

Alex: Oh why don't you come in?

Me: It's okay, I just wanted to return the money 

Alex: Come on let's have some coffee. I hardly talk to people. I don't want to miss this chance.

Me: Okay then


I entered his house. It was clean at the same time it felt empty. I could not sense a presence of any other souls other than me and Alex. It felt wrong the moment I entered his house. Alex showed me his room and we both had a seat on a comfy sofa. 


Me: Do you live alone here?

Alex: Yes, I live by myself

Me: What about your parents? 

Alex: They both died last week

Me: Oh my! I'm really sorry I was not aware of that I'm really...

Me: Why did you kill them?

Alex: You want to know, huh? Don't worry I will tell you

One day morning I was listening to music and suddenly I heard some noise 

I could not listen to music as the noise was too loud

I turned off the music and came out of my room to see what was going on. My parents were yelling at each other. My father said he couldn't handle me anymore and my mother was yelling at him back saying just yelling won't change anything. The irony isn’t it?. I wasn't surprised by my parents to comment on me as I was a disappointment to them. They both wanted to get rid of me. I had it coming anyway.

I went to the kitchen, took a knife, came back to the hall room, stabbed the knife in my mom’s stomach, detached the knife from her and stabbed the knife straight into my father's heart. I saw them both lie lifeless in front of me.

Me: So you killed your parents because they wanted to get rid of you?

Alex: No, I killed them because they interrupted me while I was listening to music.

"‘James?’ Mr Stanhope began, drawing the attention of his butler, just leaving from bringing in breakfast, ‘Has somebody been playing silly devils with my painting?’ Pointing to the great landscape above the fire, a quaint image of a thatched cottage in autumnal twilight, some few figures dressed in black were gathered in the cottage’s garden looking accusingly outwardly, towards the viewer.

‘No sir, I don’t believe so, well at least...’ — a bemused sound of surprise — ‘Well sir, What’s happened here? It looks like somebody’s been adding figures. And grotesque figures at that. Who’s that in the dirt?’ Stanhope stood warely pacing towards the painting, he had not wanted to get a closer look from his seat, but now curiosity was getting the better of him, James stood, looking between his employer and the painting, almost expectantly. ‘Looks familiar somehow, sir.’ he added before moving aside to give Stanhope the full view. There was a pause. ‘I’ll gather the staff sir, you needn’t fret, we’ll find the vandal.’

‘No!’ Stanhope almost yelled before the Butler was out the door. ‘You mustn't, it’s nothing I’m sure. Just old minds playing tricks on us.’ James was unconvinced, but checked himself before he could respond with anything other than:

‘Very good sir. If your certain. Will there be anything else, sir?’

‘No, no, I think not. You may dismiss the maidstaff for the day, yourself too.’

‘But sir, it’s still first thing in the morning; there’s no end of work to be done around the house.’

   ‘It can be done tomorrow, no, overmorrow. Tell the staff they have until Thursday to themselves. I don’t want a soul to remain. I need some peace from the eternal prattle around here.’

‘Should you rather I enforce silence, sir?’ Asked James who regretted it almost immediately.

‘I should rather you leave me. Now, sir!’ 

Meekly James bowed turning only at the door to ask about his lordship’s dinner, to which Stanhope replied he would eat in the village.

&amp;nbsp;

Hours had passed since Stanhope turned out his staff, and they had passed in deafening, building silence, a staring match between the gentleman and the landscape. It was just after noon when Stanhope finally removed himself from his chair, to get another close look at the picture, and the little figure laying in the dirt. ‘Ah, dearest Maddie. How did you come to be here of all places? And I see you have company.’ He whispered into the unearthly silence. James, the butler hadn’t been wrong: the form was undeniably grotesque, twisted and pallid and broken. ‘It’s uncanny.’ he muttered again. ‘Though the attic was never going to be permanent, I shall have to move you, and your friends, somewhere more… discreet. It would never do to be found out now, not when I’m so close to the full set of you.’",shortscarystories
"My wife just went through a miscarriage. She spent all day either brooding or crying. 

His name was going to be Robert. He was going to be the apple of her eye.

""Daddy, why does mother never smile any more?""

What answer was i to give her? ""Try, to make her smile. Mommy is very sad. ""

Rose would crack jokes and act funny, but her mom would never smile.

One night, I heard sobs from the wash room. My wife often cried late into the night these days.

I went to the wash room , to try and give her the little comfort i could. 

I saw her lifeless body on the floor, as the blood ran from a big cut across her mouth.

""I did it daddy! I made mommy smile! Now she will never frown or cry again!""

I stepped back, shocked and passed out.I woke up in the wash room, and picked up the knife which still lay on the floor.

"The theory of Quantum Immortality entails the hypothesis that when someone dies in this dimension, they carry on alive and well in another timeline. The death of the person is mourned in their previous timeline, but the continuity remains unbroken in the new one.

I set out to explore this concept. I’ve been down on my luck, estranged from family, and am financially ruined after a string of failed experiments that never became profitable. With nothing to lose, I decided to put quantum immortality to the test. 

The first experiment was by hanging. In the discontinued timeline, my body convulsed before hanging silently and still. Without family, and in the frozen winter months where the stench wouldn’t spread as quickly, I’ll assume it took weeks for my body to be discovered. In my new timeline, the rope snapped after I lost consciousness. I woke up with quite a bruise around my neck and a headache you can’t begin to imagine, but I’m alive!

My next experiment involved a head-on collision with a semi-truck. The impact must have been quite a sight to behold in my previous life. I can’t say I won’t be sorry to miss the carnage. In my new timeline, the trucker swerved at the last minute, and I continued without incident down the road.

My experiments continued. A gunshot to the head? The gun misfired. Poisoning? I vomited up the concoction within minutes. Jumping from a ledge? My fall was broken by foliage below. I walked away with some broken ribs and a fractured femur, but I’m alive.

Astounding results!

Time moves forward leaving behind a string of my corpses in another dimension.

I began to live without the fear of consequences. I’ve died many times, yet I go on. No longer fearing my end, I traveled, wined, dined, broke the law, and lived recklessly. 

I was at my peak when life took a turn in a way I did not expect. While hiking in rural parts of Asia, I lost my balance and fell into a body of water. My hiking gear dragged me below the depths. I struggled, but everything went black.

Unbeknownst to me, some villagers must have rescued me. Without the aid of proper medical equipment, they must have mistaken my coma for death.

I awake now in the dark. The air is thick and stagnant. The box in which I’m contained refuses to give. I claw, scratch, scream, and kick to no avail. The burning in my lungs as the oxygen gives out is excruciating. I slip into nothingness as my life leaves me.

Moments later, I awake. No oxygen. Kicking. Clawing. Any damage I do to my coffin is repaired in my next life… And my next life… And my next life. 

I lie here suffocating. And suffocating... And suffocating.",shortscarystories
"You'll wake up in the middle of night feeling thirsty. So thirsty that you just can't stand it and have to go get some water from your kitchen. While drinking the water you'll look out the window and see something strange on your neighbor's porch. A blue canvas maybe? Something covered up right in the middle of their yard where it shouldn't be. The light will be on it and yet you can't clearly see what it is. It's real, or seems to be, but the edges are blurry. You can't tell if it's because you're half asleep or what the cause, but something makes you feel uneasy about this sight. 

The canvas will flap a little bit but there doesn't seem to be any wind outside. It's strange, you feel a sort of terror creeping up your back but no real reason can be determined the cause for it. You'll turn your head and just as you do you'll swear that something moved outside of the canvas. An arm, a leg maybe, but when you quickly glance back at the canvas it'll be the same as it was. Only now you'll notice more details about the canvas. 

Something that makes you realize that it's not a canvas maybe? It looks like it could be a large man in overalls but you can't seem to see any distinguishing body parts. No head, arms, or legs. Maybe it's just a giant pile of something covered up by denim and not canvas. 

You'll feel the cold shiver up your spine again and realize that you should just go back to bed. But you'll never be the same again. Every night you'll see more and more of what it is. Every night you'll realize that the cold chill is not coming from the site on your neighbor's porch, but what is watching you in the room. What is sitting in the shadows that you refuse to acknowledge. And one day, you won't make it back to bed. 

Tonight is that night for me. I will see you soon.",shortscarystories

"When I woke up this morning, the first thing I noticed was the silence. I couldn’t hear my parents, or the cars on the street, or the birds chirping. Curious, I looked out my window. People were out there, but they were completely still, like statues. No matter how long I looked at them, they did not move. They didn’t even blink.

I ran to my parent’s room, to tell them about what was happening. Only, the exact same thing was happening with them. They were entirely frozen, in the middle of getting ready for work. What was happening? Was I dead? I tried calling 911, my friends, other family, but I did not get any answers. It seemed I was entirely alone in the world.

I checked back out my window, and everyone had moved. Some were looking at my window, right into my eyes. Others were at my door, seemingly stopped trying to open it. They all had a look of anger, like they were furious that I could move and they could not. I ran downstairs and locked the door, and grabbed my father’s gun just in case. I would need to figure out a way to deal with this from in here, as I feared what would happen to me outside.

That did not, however, eliminate the problem of my parents. My blood went cold when, an hour ago, I found my mother in the kitchen, holding a knife. I did not hear her move through the house, and I had no idea where my father was. I tried taking the knife from her, but her grip was ironclad. I would just need to barricade myself in my room, then.

I pushed my bookshelf and desk in front of the door, and hoped this would resolve itself before I ran out of food and water in here. However, I felt eyes on me, watching me intensely. I turned around, and there was my mother, holding the knife behind me. I knew then that the only way to stop her was the gun.

Trembling, I held the gun to her head. I must have been sobbing, but I don’t know. It was only once I pulled the trigger that I heard my mother’s voice.

“Wait!”",shortscarystories
"I don't remember anything as my memory keeps circling around random events, all overlapping each other and making no sense. My head is too crowded, noises drifting back and forth, making me feel nauseated and suddenly I drift in the verge of tears. Paranoid and frightened while seeing my Kleenex stained with blood. It was 3:00 AM and the moon looks red and big like it's about to hit Earth in a matter of seconds. Too many dogs barking outside the house hysterically as soon as the electricity went off. I keep staring at the moon while looking at my hand with remnants of red light reflecting at it. I hear deep growls back in the kitchen, it's getting really close and I feel nauseated. I decided to open the flash light from my phone while putting the headphones on, playing ""Riverhead"" by Prick. The house collapses itself in two. I look up at the sky but there's no sky. I blink my eyes and then everything dissappears. I'm in the street walking, in the air flying, in the forest eating and now I'm in space, burning inside a star. I'm now in a womb but no I'm not. I'm back again, I'm in the kitchen watching someone doing something which I can't describe. A surgery perhaps ? Who knows, but it's not a surgery since that person who's being held on the table of my kitchen is conscious, I'm freaking out. the flashlight focuses at that person, wearing a doctor's outfit that's also stained with blood. Froth keeps coming up from his mouth and it seems like he's not aware of my presence. My eyelids keep closing repeatedly, like my body wants me to unsee this but I keep moving closer with no reason, like I'm controlled by someone else. As soon as I got close I felt a deep pressure around my neck from that entity, I can hear the sound of my trachea being broken and I'm resisting, crawling in my mind, trying to find any exits but there isn't.

"I always check the back of my car before I get in. 

Ever since I got my first car, I formed a habit of checking to make sure there was no one waiting in the back to hurt me. Ever since I saw that news story back when I was a kid. The one about the woman who never made it home. The man in her back seat had other plans for her. The photo they used to show her when she was alive was ingrained into my brain forever.

Things got worse once I started my job as a bartender. I was always one of the last ones to leave. For five nights a week, I would drive home at three in the morning. Me being a guy, I was too embarrassed to ask someone to walk me to my car. To make matters worse, all employees had to park in a separate lot. Our lot was dark. It made it much harder to check the back of my car.

Then there was ""the road"". It was the only road that took me in the direction of my home. It ran through a forest with even fewer lights than the employee parking lot. Every time I got on that road, I could feel it. It was the same feeling each time.

Someone was in the back seat of my car.

I would feel their eyes on me. I could almost make out their appearance in my rearview mirror through my peripheral vision. Of course, every time I looked back, my back seat was empty.

It wasn't enough to convince me I was safe.

The feeling grew stronger week after week. I could feel them leaning closer. In my rearview, I felt like I could almost make out the shape of their face. Still, I would turn back to face them, and they would be gone.

I tried my best to cope with it. 

I almost convinced myself they weren't there.

Until one day I heard them. It was a low, tortured moan. The kind of moan a person would make if they wanted to cry for help but something was covering their mouth. I ignored it. I wanted to believe it was all in my head. Then I heard it again. And again. Over and over until I couldn't take it anymore. I looked in my rearview mirror and thought I could see the figure again. Then I turned around.

For a second, the figure stayed. It didn't disappear like it always had before. For that brief moment, I saw the woman. The one who never made it home. The one who's photo forever stuck with me. She was in my back seat.

Then she wasn't.

I scanned the back of my car. I know what I saw. Even if she was gone now, I know she was there before!

I spent so much time fearing what could be behind me, I neglected what could be in front of me. I turned to face forward again.

There was not enough time to swerve back out of the incoming lane. I could barely let out a scream before the semi collided into me.",shortscarystories

I was the police department's best negotiator. I had been in so many cases when negotiating was needed: kidnappings, hostage situations, even suicide attempts. My job was taxing on some days and pretty rewarding on others.

There was this one case though that I can't forget. It was a suicide attempt, a 16-year-old boy was threatening to jump off the bridge if anybody was to come close to him. Of course, concerned motorists immediately called 911 and they sent me with a squad. The boy was frail, he was thin and a bit pale with dark freckles covering his face. His tear-stained cheeks kept looking down at the ravine the bridge was over, his hands had a vise grip on the railing. We tried walking closer but he just shouted for us to stop and that he would really jump if we came any closer.

I tried talking to him, asking him about himself and how he got into this situation. He told me that he was recently diagnosed with HIV-AIDS. He started crying and kept blaming some other kid, saying he told them to use a condom but they didn't. His grip loosened as he cried and while he wiped his tears on one sleeve, I tried slowly walking close. He said his mom cannot know that he's gay and that he has it. I promised him that she wouldn't hear a word from me. I crept closer and closer until I was able to gently hold his hand. He turned to me, his piercing green eyes red from crying. I gave him a soft smile and squeezed his hand, promising to him that I'll help him get through all of this. He nodded feebly and started to loosen up more. I hugged him, tight. He needed it. 

As I was about to pull him up from the other side, he slipped and started falling. I caught a hold of his arm and almost fell myself, had I not held on to the railing. Our combined weight was too much for my arm to handle, but it was a good thing that the policemen I was sent with were quick on their feet and got us back to the safe side. I hugged the boy tightly, whispering affirmations and encouragements to him. 

I monitored him for years after that. I helped him explain to his mother what happened to him and helped with medical bills when they couldn't afford it.

He died after 3 years of fighting his illness. His mother, grief-stricken, had become another suicide attempt in my records. She's in a mental institution now, getting treated for depression and PTSD.

I was the force's best negotiator. I have several cases of suicide attempts, the 16-year-old boy, his mother, and so many others. I just hoped that someone would be sent to me as well.

But no one came to save me.

The ravine is dark tonight. The wind chilly against my skin. I jump.",shortscarystories

Ever since I was young, something has always tried to get into whatever room I was in. It started in elementary school, when someone tried to open the bathroom stall door, and only stopped when I reached out to hold the door shut, no matter what I said. It happened about once a month every since that time- it happened at home, at friends houses, even in hotel rooms, alone or with others. Something always tries the knob or lever, sometimes even when I am sleeping, always slowly, always as nosily as possible, as if whatever is trying to open the door is giving me ample time. It seems like it can open any kind of door in any state, like the one time it tried to open an elevator mid-floor. 

&amp;nbsp;
I gave up asking who was out there after never receiving an answer. The only saving grace was that as soon as my hand was on the doorknob or latch, the force would imminently abandon its efforts to enter. 

&amp;nbsp;
That is what I wanted to say to the stewardesses and undercover officer on my flight, the ones that pinned me to the airplane seat because I made a mad dash towards the emergency door because I saw the handle jiggle. They think I am having a panic when I yelled that I HAD to hold the door closed, and tried to assure me that the handle is just a little loose, and when the plane is in motion, it will always be locked. I tried to explain everything you just read in just a few words while I watched the handle on the escape door jump to OPEN. The emergency door snapped off and disappeared in an instant, and an endless, cold dull white sucking void appeared. 

&amp;nbsp;
Those that were pulled into it first knew that it wasn't the sky at 35,000 feet. It was what was always behind the door it was trying to open.",shortscarystories
"The last few days had been Hell on Earth,  a whirling tornado of work related stress crashing on an already tenuous relationship with my family.

When I was teenager, my father would bring me to go fishing with him. My favorite time of year to fish was always the winter, something about the cold made our little slice of New Jersey feel all the more distant from whatever was on our minds.

I packed my things and left a note in my study for my wife. She wasn't a fan of fishing and she always hated how much time I spent away but she knew that i'd always come back to her. To tell you the truth, I was excited to simply turn off my rambling mind and catch some winter bass.

The spot I choose was privy to a deeper part of the reservoir, naturally it was my favorite.

I settled in, waiting for the bass to fall for my suspending jerkbait.

Eventually something bit.

I reeled it in, and stumbled backwards onto the frosted ground as the familiar tug of resistance gave way.

The hook had landed in the flesh of something I couldn't recognize, upon a closer look it appeared to be a human hand with most of its fingers reduced to nubs.

I couldn't stop myself from vomiting once the rest of the bloated corpse floated up to the surface. It was scarred from head to toe, her pale skin was riddled by bruises but I recognized the tattoos and the raven black hair even as it seemed to fall away from her scalp. Her mouth had been carved into a permanent smile, with the edges and the entirety of her left side showing signs of fish bites and bacterial decay.

It was my wife's body.

I drank myself out of pain and loss for years after that, but the part that gets me and keeps me up at night?

During restless nights, i'm the man putting her under that frigid water and I can see her eyes turn empty and distant. I can see myself walking back to the truck and starting the ignition before returning home and feeling the hot water drag everything into the drain below.

But those are just nightmares right?",shortscarystories
" 7,8 billion heartbeats.

Scientist discovered that listening to a person’s heartbeat can have a relaxing effect on people, stimulating positive hormones and making them feel more inclined to each other.

The same scientist discovered that when 2 hearts beat at the same pace the organ that creates violent hormones decreases 93% in activity.

With the help of ultra low frequencies they managed to make the heart of two people perfectly synchronize.

This method was quickly sold to the military who used it to keep people riots calm and peaceful.

The so called “Redbox” was quickly sold world wide, but not only to the military.

People all over the world saw ways to exploit it, a Redbox in the waiting room for first aid would make people a lot calmer and people near a Redbox would work more efficiently.

It didn’t take long before people began to copy the Redbox design, China began mass producing their own version and they entered the black market all over the world.

"I yawned. Tonight was my fourth and last night shift in a while. It was a busy one. There was heavy snowfall, and many accidents. Broken arms, broken legs, a few concussions. 

I yawned again. I turned my window down, hoping the cold air would keep me awake more. I screamed along with the radio. Just to try to stay alert. 

Allrigh Jen, slow down a bit. This is a sharp turn. Phew. Went okay. I started to feel a bit better. More alert and awake. I could already feel my bed. I saw the sun coming up. Strange, in the middle of the winter. 

I noticed a house near the road. I could've sworn it wasn't there when I drove to work last night. Must be my lack of sleep. 

At last, I was home. I noticed a strange car on the drive way. Weird. Both my parents cars were home, so who's was it? And so early. 

I walked inside. No one noticed me. My mother was crying, my dad was holding her hand, white as a ghost. 

"" What do you mean, you found our Jen?"" Dad asked. 

""We believe she drove off the road six months ago, when she didn't come home from her night shift. She must have taken a sharp turn or fell asleep and drove into the lake. We couldn't find any car tracks due to the heavy snowfall last winter. Her window was down, the blow and cold water must have knocked her out almost immediatly.""",shortscarystories

He never breaks his freakish smile,

He unfolds his fingers and he waves,

"I hate it when new vermin finds its way into my house. I can always hear them scuttling around above my head, their little legs scurrying by when any decent person would be asleep. It makes me sick to think about. Ugh. I can't stand infestations.

Now, some people might call an exterminator. Some people might set traps. Not me. From my experience, you have to do it yourself. You have to wait till they're unsuspecting, then you can creep up to where they've made their disgusting dry nest, and surprise them. You need to finish them off completely with your own hands, all on your own, and somehow it stops them from coming back. It's like they communicate or something. 

Or you just get them when they rear their ugly little faces. Unless it's a little one. For some reason, i can't bear to harm the little ones. I don't know why. I always scare them off rather than kill them when they come down from their nest. It's okay though. They always bring the rest of the vermin down with them soon. And then I can exterminate them all. 

I always feel a tiny bit sad about the little ones though. I can still hear the voice of the first one i let go, crying hysterically, telling his mother about the tall man in the basement.

But I gotta admit, even though they're vermin, they do taste pretty good.",shortscarystories
"The best thing about car rides at night is the illusion of transformation—the mystery of the shadows, their concealment of things from the reveries of deep dreams, or their begrudged containment of nightmarish horrors. As you ride through cities you can imagine whatever you’d like; the towering shapes could be ancient, dust-choked spires in which baleful warlocks conduct sorcerous rituals, or the unearthed appendages of colossal creatures long-buried in antediluvian Earth; whose forms have only partially been revealed by the sweeping winds of the valley through which your exploratory vehicle drives.  

The worst thing about car rides is that they always come to an end. There may not be an intended destination—a fated point somewhere in that comforting or terrifying darkness—but there is an end. The car will run out of gas, the sun will rise, and the world as it had once been will again emerge—returning you to the life from which you sought to escape. The ephemerality of your noctivagant voyage becomes unnervingly apparent as the hours go by.  

The darkness begins to seem weaker, and with its lessening the immutable shadow of anxiety returns. As the world around you becomes clearer you start to feel within your belly that nausea just previously quelled by your sojourn beneath night’s veil. You are blasted by those familiar, day-woken terrors; Unease, stress, tiredness, worry, a volley that seizes you in a catalepsy of self-hatred and fear.  

Spires shake off their dust, esoteric tomes warp into computers and documents of mundane importance. Warlocks and Witches, Demons and Gorgons, turn to managers and supervisors, teachers and coaches. The milky, spheroid deity at which you stared in awe is usurped by a cruel, burning orb that illuminates everything in the worst way, in the harshest of light. Shadowy specters transform into a throng of belligerent, hateful, unforgiving people, and again those stares of unwarranted contempt tear at you. The hours crawl by with unbearable slowness, malevolently lingering on the worst moments; the most embarrassing events. Time’s cruel mischief.  

Night seems but a thing of the past, a phenomenon that you can’t say for sure that you’ve experienced. You are but an insect, upturned and writhing belly-up as a prodding stick pokes at your weak carapace; the plaything of a mocking God, to be pierced and skewered and laughed at as you die.",shortscarystories
"I don't know where he came from and I had never seen him before in my area. A couple of months ago I stepped out of my house and a ragged man was next to my car and he shook my hand.

""hello I would like to decorate my living room with your letters of unpaid house bills"" he told me

There was something about his voice which made me weak and he simply walked off. After that first meeting I got a phone call off my boss and he sounded a little strange like he was being controlled. 

""hello Martin I am firing you because you need to start recieving letters about unpaid house bills so that the decorator can put it up on his living room walls"" my boss told me

I tried calling him back but got nothing and when I took my company to court for unlawful dismissal, the judge seemed like he was being mind control and same with the lawyers. The judge told me that it was for good reason that I had been fired so that I could start recieving letters about unpaid house bills for the decorator to decorate his walls.

Any job I applied to they would all reject me for the same reasons, which is that I needed to start getting letters about unpaid bills for the decorators living room walls. As I couldn't find another job I started receiving bill payments for water, heating, mortgage, electricity and tax which all quickly added up. Then those letters disappeared and I got a letter from the decorator which read 'I have recieved enough letters from you about the unpaid house bills which look nice on my living room walls'

I was finally able to get a job but then the decorator randomly met up with me at the supermarket and he said ""my front room walls will look nice with newspaper clippings that are about the death of your family"" and he simply walked away.

I contacted the police and told them everything but they simply told me ""sir of course your family needs to die because the decorator needs newspaper clippings about your murdered family for his front room wall""

"Because of the recent tensions in their relationship, Ted offered to take Jen out on the lake. He had a smile on his face as he offered her his hand and she gladly took it, stepping gingerly onto the boat. His fishing rod was set up behind her and at the back of the boat was a hamper and some wine. It was nice to see that he'd made an effort; he'd even combed his hair and was wearing the shirt she'd bought him for his birthday. 

It was a gorgeous day and Jen was barely concentrating on the conversation because the view of the lake was so stunning. The sun's reflection on the calm surface of the water was so bright she’d had to put on her sunglasses, but even through the red tinted lenses the forest and distant lazy meadows were beautiful. 

""So anyway, I had this crazy dream last night..."" Jen zoned halfway back into the conversation.

""Oh yeah?"" She asked, absentmindedly. In the years they'd been together he'd suffered from fever dreams on occasion, and she really felt bad for him. It was usually when he was sick. 

""Yeah, I was in this cold empty house,"" he looked ponderous as he recounted the dream, like somebody picking through the details of a childhood memory.

""And all I remember was this feeling like I was hunting something, you know? It was like I was playing some game, and I was all adrenaline."" 

Jen was looking at the water around his feet now, trickling from side to side with the rocking of the boat, which creaked softly as he spoke. 

""And then,"" he continued, with renewed vigour. 
""Out of nowhere this thing just jumped out at me! And next thing you know I'm swatting at it with my hands - only it wasn't just my hands, I was holding a hammer... and there was blood all over the place and that's when I wake up, trying to rub the blood outta my eyes.""

Jen removed her sunglasses, a gesture considered and concerned, and took a good look at him. It was one of those looks where you feel like a person's staring into your soul, examining what they find within, and tenderly testing the waters. 

""Damn, Ted."" She allowed her gaze to fall once more to his feet. Her heart halted. The breath fled her lungs. It hadn't been water sloshing below his seat. Everything was red through those sunglasses. 

""Dreams are just the craziest things aren't they?""

"Adam Stevens was a healthy person with a rare blood disease. He was able to walk, run, eat and do all other regular activities yet his days were numbered. He was transferred to multiple hospitals. Many doctors couldn’t even figure out the blood group of Stevens. His days were nearing it ends. Finally, a doctor named Curt Williams from Luxembourg found a way to cure Stevens's disease. 


Curt sent a mail to Stevens: Kommissiounen Medical Services, “Mr Stevens we can help you with treating your disease. It will be a long process with a huge amount of blood need to be donated. Your blood group is a very rare one. There are only seven people in this world who has this special kind of blood group. You’re lucky that we are able to gather those seven people to donate blood and help with the treatment “.


Stevens arrived at Luxembourg and reached the hotel which Curt mentioned in his personal mail. The receptionist handed the key to his room which is the eighth and final room situated at the end of the hallway. When he was on his way to his room he noticed that every seven rooms he came across in the hallway were being cleaned with a tag on the outside of the door saying ‘Reserved’.


Stevens was going to be treated in the next day morning. He was having a good sleep until he heard a banging noise. A noise of loud yet suppressed gunshot. He suddenly woke up and looked at the time. It was 3.36 am. The banging noise was heard once again but this time it was close. At this point, Stevens felt something was wrong. He called the room service but nobody picked up. He took his mobile to call the cops but it was dead. The banging noise got closer and closer along with the noise of people screaming. He got scared and wanted to escape from this place immediately but he had to run across the seven rooms to reach the reception.


Stevens placed his ears on the door. He could hear footsteps approaching his opposite room. He heard the opposite room's door getting locked and thought that this was the right time to escape from this hell of a situation. Stevens opened his door to run. When he stepped outside his shoes were soaked in blood. The floor was flooded with blood flowing from the other seven rooms. Stevens didn’t know what was going on. He was shocked and wanted to get out of this place immediately until he saw three masked men standing at the opposite side blocking his way to the reception. Stevens heard the banging noise followed by screaming from his opposite room.


Stevens was in absolute fear and thought he was going to be murdered by these unknown people. When the hallway was filled with silence and dread the man who stood in the middle asked,

"It was my turn to give a speech at my high school graduation, but my sister was acting weird, she was happy for me I know that, but she wasn't at the same time.

Everyone was talking about the thing that hid at our school's emergency staircase, that targeted girls and later on their bodies were found laying there lifeless with chunks missing, it gave me a uneasy feeling as I went on the podium to give my speech.

I see my sister get up and run towards the exit with a few of her friends, she wont dare to go to the stairs I thought to myself, but I couldn't stay standing there looking as she disappeared from my site, I just ran off the stage and went to search for her. 

I found myself standing alone at the dimly lit staircase, I started climbing up, bodies started falling on me, I felt sick looking at their faces bloodied, but none of was my sister’s.
Maybe she didn’t come here? Maybe I was overthinking? Then i saw it, i saw the creature, it was smiling at me, but it’s eyes they seemed sad, it didn’t attack me it just stood there smiling.

“What do u want?” I asked
“To be free” it said

I offered it to take over me, and it did, the creature took over me, I went back to the audience who were in surprise of my weird behaviour, and I smiled “the creature is gone” I announced.
Everyone went mute for a moment, but then they started cheering. I was their hero, I still get hungry sometimes, but I make sure the bodies aren’t found again.

Finally, when you wake up, you come to the realization that it was all a dream and you probably even forget about it by the time your feet hit the floor. Happens all the time. 
That person is me. How could you forget about me?!  I was your best friend for years. We did everything together. Don't you remember? 
I gave you everything. When the dream man came to us and said only one of us could wake up I let you have it! You said you would never forget me no matter what he did to your mind! But here we are... 
The next time I find you in the scape of your dreams, watch your back. I'm tired of being ignored.",shortscarystories
"The midday Texan sun shone down on him as he stood along Interstate 10, staring at the barren landscape around him. Nothing moved. He supposed the heat was too much for any kind of activity. He wouldn’t know. He couldn’t feel it. He couldn’t feel much of anything anymore.

Pulling the long duster he wore closer to his body, he ducked the bill of his cap lower on his forehead. These things would keep people from looking at him too closely. He wasn’t ready for them to see what he really was. Not yet. That time would come soon enough.

He walked forward, knocking the dust from his boots. He had to go West. The convergence would soon happen. They would gather on the coast and show themselves for the first time. The world would then know exactly what it was in for. The Apocalypse would start in earnest.

He walked on, waving at a car that sped by. He grinned at the thought of how the driver would react to him if he really knew. He longed for the fear that would fill the air. It’s what his kind thrived on. That and sustenance. Those were the only things that truly mattered. The rest was just ensuring they would get them, but it would be a blast getting there.

He pulled the duster tighter around his damaged body, keeping his wounds hidden within. People thought his kind was stupid, acting only on instinct alone. He had orders and he would follow them all perfectly. They all would. They would show the world there was nothing slow about them. His kind was the perfect killing machine.

He smiled as he pushed forward, heading to the West where he belonged. His brethren waited there. Together they would overthrow the world. They would conquer all because zombies could do more than just eat.",shortscarystories

I woke to the sound, my sleep fogged mind confused. Was my bathroom tap leaking?
Drip, drip, drip, drip. 
I try to get out of bed to shut it off, but find I can't move my arms and legs.
Drip, drip, drip. 
Startled I look around. I'm in a concrete room, strapped to an old style hospital bed. My neck hurts.
Drip, drip, drip.
The room is otherwise empty. A fluorescent light shines above me. I shiver as the gown I'm in is thin and open backed.
Drip, drip, drip.
I try to figure out where the sound is coming from; I can't see a sink or pipe anywhere.
Drip, drip, drip. 
As I listen I realise the sound is coming from under the bed. I struggle some more but the pain in my neck intensifies so I stop.

I know you're probably sitting there in your chair or in front of your TV or computer thinking that your house is safe. I've locked the doors, I've checked the windows, shut the blinds etc.But seriously though, did you lock the door? i suggest you make sure it really is. If there's a padlock, make sure it's bolted tight. Your windows? double check the locks. If you have a sliding door, make sure it's secured with a small pole or a broom end and draw the curtains. If you have blinds or shutters, keep them shut, just in case you're visible to anyone or anything outside.

Done? Good. I just wanted to check in and make sure you're truly safe and having a great experience scrolling through the internet. So please, sit back, relax and continue whatever it is you were doing. Now, you can truly say you are safe in your own home.

"My grandmother had always kept an old cardboard box in her closet. I had caught glimpses of it before but, I had never touched or seen what was inside. The week grandma Harriet we had went to here house, to take whatever we may have wanted. Her sister had wanted us to do that, I, of course, wanted the box. It was shrouded in mystery for the last 14 years I'd sometimes seen it and I needed to know what was inside it, I went looking for the box in the closet but it was buried under clothes and cleaning supplies just about as deep as grandma was. I had to dig for about 5 minutes just to find it. When I did the smell was horrendously bad. Grandpa James had died about 2 months before and grandma Harriet had never spoken about him, but. I saw why now. As I had opened the box, the stench really hit me. When I saw what was inside i had to turn and retch up whatever foul demon had infested my system. Grandpa James was sat there. A decaying, maggot and wasp covered rot of the man he once was. As the wasps noticed their home had been invaded they turned to swarm at me.

"Where I am, I'm not subjected to the madness and desperation of the human race. I've always been a rock'n'roll vocalist with a definitive style. The nightclub fire after the biggest gig of my life combined with my need for audience interaction kept my groupies close to the stage while the house literally burned down. There was something in the air and the crowd went wild, stampeding and crushing the audience. When there was no chance at escape, the chaos extended to their animal-like instincts.

&amp;#x200B;

Fueled with alcohol and adrenaline, some sought solace in the kitchen where the poor chef was preparing bar food. He raised his cleaver only to be tackled by a mob who grabbed his cleaver and sent it straight through the top of his head. It must've been the acid my guitarist had handed out. He always played with a doll on his guitar and made the stupid puppet dance.

&amp;#x200B;

S and OB were the ones I was worried about while I lay dying. S was a true Wiccan with premonitions and had told me days earlier not to play the gig. When I saw her in the afterlife, she was tattered and torn with her devotion to my craft even though it cost her life. Her bones were crushed in the stampede when she rushed the stage to save me instead of reaching safety.

&amp;#x200B;

OB was the brash bouncer with a gruff voice who loved nothing more than his dice games. He was a couldn't afford heat. I was planning on bringing the paycheck to him to take care of his daughter and sons who ended up freezing to death at home. Tragically, he couldn't open the door for the crowd to get out. Only the roaches in the venue survived the aftermath and the coroners claimed they fed on OB's body after the smoke cleared.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess we were all brought to this afterlife together. Even my promoter, a sleazy man who had his neck broken in the stampede, still showed up at my door in my new rotten home as the mayor of Hell. Who cares when we're all dead? Hell isn't so bad. I found out the acoustics are great in the graveyard. One day, my childhood dog came out to see me and never left my side.

&amp;#x200B;

My mission became clear one Halloween night. Everything was dark and broken. OB had lost his mind, taking up roaches in his bathrobe and S was treating her battered limbs with sewing needles. My friends are dead and cold but they still treat me like I'm a ruler. I have studied notebooks from dead scholars and conducted my own experiences to save my loved ones from their torment.

"I went to my parents with a triumphant smile on my face. I had earned a victory for my team. I expected a tight hug and many kisses from mom and a gift or two from dad. Instead I heard a half mumbled ""well done"" from mom and not so much as a smile from dad. He was wearing sunglasses, and mom too, which was weird as it was almost 5 pm and the sunlight was on its way out. I was pretty tired so I did not think much of it.

The ride home was short and uneventful. When we got home, dad opened the door for me and we went inside. Dad stubbed his toe on the couch and cursed, as his sunglasses fell, revealing his brilliant emerald eyes.

"When my boyfriend dumped me, i got into a towering rage. I know that most people tend to be sad when their significant other dumps them, but no, not me. I was always a great girlfriend, i always tried to make him happy, i fucking gave my all to that relationship and now he thinks that he could just dump me?

No, not a chance.

He tortured my soul. He never made me feel loved. And he can not get away with this. 

With these thoughts, i texted someone who seemed to be into witchcraft. I told her i'll pay as much as she likes. Just make him fall in love with me. Make me his breath.Make his life a mess.

And she did. Within a month, he came to my door crying. I've never seen him that needy before that day. He apologized several times. 

I was so overjoyed. 

I told him to fuck off, told him that he was so pathetic. These were his words back then. I made fun of him. And i loved that frown on his face. That sadness. 

Ah how the tables were turned.

But that night, i started to feel so uneasy.

""i'm here.."" that sentence echoed in my mind all night long. I didn't hear it.. i mean.. it was like an inner voice. But i somehow knew it wasn't. 

I couldn't sleep that night. 

Then, i started to get that uneasy feeling when i'm working, when i'm trying to sleep.. out of the blue..

""you have to pay..a soul.."" 

I was so scared, and i knew that this was because of the spell.

He was texting me all day, and i was just ignoring. I spent all my time trying to ignore that bad feeling.

Then, this morning, he showed up again.

He was begging, crying, telling me things full of love and pain.

He didn't seem normal..

After a point, i started to beg for him to go.

He was talking nonstop, and then.. he suddenly stopped and looked at me in a way that i'll never forget. It was a look that made me sure he went insane. 

""I'll kill you.""

And he started to run towards me with a knife which i don't even know when he got.

I was petrified, but i did my best to withstand. When i felt the cold knife upon my neck, i started to cry loudly and began to say that i love him, that we could be together if he stops this. I was praying to God that my words sounded convincing. 

But they didn't. He didn't stop.

And i didn't wanna die.

When i regained consciousness, he was dead. Floor's color was crimson. I..don't know what happened. He was stabbed several times...

But when i got to my room, i started to hear footsteps.

There's.. There's no one home. Except us.

"
Rosie burst into the world with one last push. Exhausted, I waited for the sound of her cries. But they did not came. My eyes searched for her, hoping to see her for the first time. 

But Rosie lay blue in her arms. 

I stared at her tiny and still body. Static filled my ears. It was not possible. She had been so lively before, making her own space inside my body. I dreamt of the day she would join me in the outside world. I read her stories and sang lullabies. I prepared my home and my heart for her.

But my Rosie disappeared from view in a sea of light blue hospital garments and concerned staff.

I was empty. 

My hopes and dreams stopped with her lack of breath and followed her out of the room. The concerned tone of Dr Reid did nothing to quell the anxiety filling my womb. In that moment, I was nothing and no one, only fear. I was ready to blow.

I wished. I wished with all my being for the universe to bring her back. I wished hard enough to fill my brain with one single thought. But my senses overwhelmed me and I was gone.

The next thing I saw was a white ceiling, so bright I thought I died. I pondered on staying, waiting for the light to claim me. But it did not. I heard muffled noises. Then I understood these were voices and these crescendoed to phrases. Only one mattered.

They had saved her.

That was how Rosie came into the world, with Death by her side who had to learn to let go. 

Rosie came home with me, bundled tightly and safely in blankets. I would never let go.

The first few days were so hard. I spent every minute absorbing every little detail. I wanted to commit it to memory, my Rosie. But the days got even harder. 

Rosie was so hungry. I never expected someone so young to feed so much. I was always exhausted, sleepless. I started hallucinating. I saw impossible shadows in the corner of my eyes. Then I started hearing voices, some I recognised, some I did not. But Rosie was restless and required care. I had to weather the storm with her.

When I did get sleep, I had nightmares. In one, Rosie kept drinking and drinking from my breast until the milk turned pink and then bright red. Rosie didn’t stop. The image was so vivid, it tinted every nightmare after that. I thought about calling the nurses and ask if that was even possible, but I was never one to ask for advice. 

I knew I would be soon extinguished like a candle. 

But what else can I do. I wished for her to come back to me. I often wonder if Death truly let her go. 


Not that it matters. Perhaps the Rosie that came back is not the same, but I will always be her mother.",shortscarystories

Last month he started bringing dead animals into the house.  It started when he found a rat and brought it to me, at first I thought this wouldn’t be much of a problem, as I’ve always hated rodents, but recently he started bringing in more animals, such as birds and squirrels, and then last week he even brought in a finger, and it has been escalating from there.

"Mermaids,

Creatures of legends and myths, or so we thought. They turned out to be more real than expected.

On the first day of Febuari they attacked, they made themselves known to the world.

A giant tsunami flooded the entire east coast of America, drowning millions in the process.

Hydrokinesis scientist called it, the power to bend water to your will.

Using this powers the mermaids seemed unstoppable.

The flooded half of Japan and multiple islands in the world suddenly disappeared into the sea. Entire cities in Europe sunk to the sea bottom while the Manhattan suddenly became part of the sea again Later statistics showed that 60% of the coast was attacked world wide in one day.

However after overcoming the initial shock Nations began to fight back. The military figured out that bullets could kill a mermaid as easily as any other animal. Other countries dumped toxics and oil into the ocean, after that they would set their entire coast on fire. After having lost 18% of America to the sea the military managed to kill most of the mermaids in the flooded cities.

However the mermaids had a second trick.

They began singing.

As people found out, mermaids can produce an almost angelic song that could have various effects on the people who heard it.

It would make someone fall in love with a mermaid which led to them jump into the water where they would be ripped apart by mermaids.

Sometimes the song would make people snap, turning them into violent killers that turned on their allies.

Multiple squads had disappeared this way.

The singing could also make you feel so miserable you couldn’t think of anything else then killing yourself. The suicide ratings in the army increased with 67% in the following days.

But mankind did not fall to the song of madness, instead they developed counters.

Earbuds for every soldier and speakers blasting on full volume where they launched a counterattack with a team of psychologists on the sideline to watch out for the people who might have been affected by the song.

17 days after the mermaids appeared the war was almost over. Most of the countries in the world had reclaimed their lost land and were working on securing the coast for future attacks. Of Course the smaller islands were still in war but they were slowly winning terrain.

However everything changed yesterday.

Someone recorded a video of a mermaid singing with his phone,

Seconds later it was uploaded to youtube.

And two minutes later, the world lost its mind.",shortscarystories
"A quarter-of-a-million-pound, thatch-roofed cottage in County Antrim by a lake with its own swans. That’s where I saw him that first time after he left me. He was with another woman— his fiancé the TV programme said— and he was looking happy, handsome, in excellent shape.

I’d just had the stupidest accident of my life at a zebra crossing. I had a bit of back pain and an unhealed gash right in the centre of my forehead.

I felt humiliated: Seeing him, how he was, and seeing myself, as I was, in the bathroom mirror. The contrast was painful.

After that I stopped watching TV altogether and I permanently deleted all my social media accounts so there was no chance I could ever see his face again.

Weeks later I started seeing him elsewhere.

I’d be waiting for a train in the station and see him standing among the other commuters. Or if I walked, I’d crane my neck— sometimes painfully— to see through the windows of every car that passed me on the road. I was looking for him, fearing that he would be the driver and that he’d see me with my Tesco bags, unbrushed hair and scarred head, that he’d look through the glass at me with pity in his eyes. Sometimes I even thought I saw him there in the vague shapes of other, similar men.

I stopped going outdoors. Other than in ambulances I haven’t been over my doorstep in six months.

For a long time after my chronic agoraphobia hit I’d read to keep the crushing boredom at bay. I was never really a scholar so I mostly enjoyed magazines. I preferred anything about fashion. But the cruelty just wouldn’t end: Now the models on the shiny pages looked exactly like him. I’d stare at their faces for hours, trying to tell them apart from the man who was my man. I couldn’t. As far as my eyes could tell every image was him: Looking at me broodingly from catwalks. Smiling at me from ads for men’s watches, jewellery and eau de cologne.

I tried reading books without pictures but the words rearranged themselves on the page and he was there again.

I gave up reading. My world shrank further.

It’s been months now since I started seeing him in my food. Soft food would reform itself into an exact copy of his head. Hard food appeared as a tiny sculpture of his naked body as I remembered it from the last time we had sex.

Since I’ve stopped eating my weight has fallen below seven stones. I look like a walking skeleton now and I’ve been hospitalised twice. The last time the doctors wanted to place me in a special anorexia unit. I refused.

I left the hospital for the last time weeks ago. I’m starving myself to death slowly.

Death is the only place where I don’t have to see his face.",shortscarystories
"  A window curtain waves as the cold breeze flows through the cracked wooden window. The sill cracked and scarred from the battles of storms, blizzards and rugged branches. 

The grey cottage creaking with every brush of wind combing its walls. The moon glistening a blue hazed light through the glass pane; caressing the tiled wall. A faint drip echoes from the porcelain of a sink in the small room filled with ripped towels and a tub. 

Therein lies a man resting in the bath of his home. His hair and beard grey like that of a wolf in cold. His hands rough from the work in chopping and hunting. A man of survival in the forest that grows. 

Footsteps echo away from the room into the hallway leaving the man alone. A door opens and shuts as the man lay perfectly still. The pupils of his eyes copying the color of his beard and hair. His eyes and chest not moving, as still as a frozen lake in the midst of winter. 

He lay in warm liquid flowing from his now hollowed chest. Covering him like a blanket hanging over the bend touching the floor. An engine begins;  changing course of the winds while the flakes begin to grow. 

A flake flows through that crack of window towards the warm liquid that overflows. Softly touching the maroon pond forming on the wood of the floor. A pond that will forever change the color of the pure white snow.",shortscarystories

People come in through the door, hugging and kissing each other. I don’t care. I see gifts and know some are for me.

I run off to the Christmas tree to look if anything new is under it. I’m bent over looking at the presents when I feel like someone else is in the room and I turn around. A man is standing above me, looking down at me.

“Aren’t you going to give your uncle a hug?”

I get up and hug his leg. He puts his big hand on my head.

“You’re such a pretty girl.” 

I let go of him and look up at him. He pulls his other hand from behind his back and there’s a wrapped present in it.

“Open it, don’t tell your parents.”

He winks at me. I grab the gift and run upstairs to my room before anybody sees it. I close my bedroom door and tear off the paper.

It’s a stupid doll. One you can dress and do her hair. I drop it on the ground.

“Owie that hurts mommy,” it says after it hits the ground.

I look down at the doll and I see something sticking out of its back. It’s a secret compartment and I reach down into it. I pull out a shiny coin that looks brand new. I put it in my pocket. My dad calls to me from downstairs and says it’s time for dinner. I roll my eyes and head down.

Dinner is boring. I sneak out during an argument about politics and go to my bedroom. It’s hard for me to fall asleep but I pull out the coin and look at it. I squeeze it tight and sleep thinking about new toys Christmas morning.

I wake up to a voice.

“Mommy?”

I rub my eyes. I don’t think I said that.

“Mommy where’s my coin?”

I sit up and see the doll standing there.

“This isn’t funny,” I say.

The doll takes steps forward and I lean back against my bed, pulling the blankets up.

“I want my coin mommy!” The doll seems to be shouting at me. I can’t talk as it jumps up on the bed coming towards me. The voice is deeper and angry.

“GIVE ME MY COIN!”

I scream and throw the doll away from me. After a moment, my parents turn on the lights and rush into my room.

“Honey what’s wrong?”

“The doll uncle gave to me! It’s alive!”

“Uncle? You don’t have an uncle sweety,” my mom says as she pets my hair.

I’m old enough to watch my little sister and brother. Especially now that I see my prayers can be answered! 

There had been so many people on the beach earlier that we couldn’t find a single intact seashell. Now with the people leaving and the water withdrawing, there were countless shells all for us!

God must have heard me asking to “Get rid of these people so we can find some shells.”

I beamed a smile and admired the bucket load of perfect shells that we gathered in record time. 

“It’s like when Moses needed to cross the red sea! God pulled all the water back from the beach!” My back to the water looking at the beach and to the sides “He pulled the water back really far and it scared all the…”

"Did you know that trees can scream?

It's true. Trees in areas that are going through droughts have bubbles of carbon dioxide stored inside their trunks, which can create an ultrasonic sound that can be taken as crying out.

Trees can scream.

I was walking through the woods when I heard it for the first time. I was searching for my cat. His name was Bubbles.

Bubbles, who had ran out of the front door. Bubbles, who had ran into the woods.

Bubbles, whose shrill cry just rang through my ears.

An overwhelming joy filled me, and I ran towards where I heard the meow. He was close! Bubbles was close! He was right... here?

In front of me was a tree. A single tree. It was tall, it was thick, and it didn't have any leaves. But it was a tree.

So why did I hear my cat's hissing from inside it?

There was a very small crack in the tree. Was Bubbles inside the tree? I tried to peek inside, but it was too small and too dark to see anything.

And then it opened.

The crack in the tree didn't just widen- it spread apart like a door, making a disgusting tearing noise as it did so. I stepped back in horror as the tree fully opened itself, exposing something inside.

And while its suffering sounded nearly identical to Bubbles, it didn't take me long for me to realize that this was no longer my cat.

I ran. I ran away from the tree, forcing myself to ignore the awful, awful noises coming from the tree. I ran, and I ran, and I ran, and I tripped.

The root I tripped on lifted itself out of the ground and grabbed my ankle.

I screamed, struggling against the tree as its long, hard branches reached down and pulled at my limbs, lifting me upwards and away from the ground. That same horrible tearing noise came from the tree, surrounding me, as a crack opened up in the tree, wide enough for me to fit inside.

And then before I could react, the tree's branches stretched, contorted, and shoved me into the crack.

It closed shut behind me, and I couldn't move. It was so cramped. I felt the wooden material around me scraping against my entire body, making it nearly impossible to move properly.

I felt strange. Branches started to come from the walls surrounding me, wrapping around my arms and legs and travelling up my body. But they didn't feel like branches. They felt smooth, slimy even- and they had a heartbeat.

I screamed in pain as the branches dug into my limbs, poking into me and drawing blood. They grew into my skin, spread through my body, and emerged elsewhere. It was making me part of it.

And all I could do was scream.

The branches were travelling upwards, and they began to grow through my eyes.

"Everyone all around the world is at great danger. Look at all the people around you, your friends, family or coworkers. They aren’t gonna be themselves soon. Find a safe place, get supplies and water. Just hope you aren’t already one of them.

A few weeks ago, our pathology lab discovered something similar about almost all of the blood samples we received had a seemingly harmless virus in them. The virus was virtually dead. It caused no problems in the body, no response from the nervous system, nothing. So we ignored it for the first few tests. Afterwards, we got it from more and more samples and soon enough we grew worried. This virus was in pretty much every single blood sample we got. We noticed on trend however, so far the virus has never been found in AB negative blood. 

We soon got together with all the other pathology labs across the country and we found out this virus has also been in their blood samples. From further research we found out this virus was deadly. 

It’s basically a zombie virus. It flows in the blood and takes over the brain. The virus spreads through air and water and can handle every sterilising and filtering technique we have. The virus can survive all temperatures. 

From researching the virus we found out that the virus activates after 6 months. It spreads to every inch of the body. 

We were able to activate the virus in rat species. The afflicted rats first died within the first 24hrs of infection. Then they woke up again and viciously attacked anything that moved. They didn’t just bite but they literally ripped everything apart. The zombie rats had no weaknesses. 

Soon enough the government took us down. Soon we’re going to see cases of zombies. The virus will activate.

Afterwards, you will begin to regain your memories, which may induce vivid hallucinations, uncontrollable weeping, hysterical laughter, or spontaneous rage. Try your best to remain calm and collected, your life, and the lives of billions, depend on it. 

Upon awaking and remembering the need for this eventuality, you will need to enter the corridor. You will know which one. Follow the path, complete the tasks, activate the machine, and enter the chamber.

In case you cannot remember before you encounter these challenges, here are some reminders.

1. She doesn't exist. We don't know why you see her, but she can't harm you. Any pain you receive that is caused by her only exists in your head, and you can use your training to remove it.

2. They DO exist. They ARE real. They CAN kill you. But only if you're standing in the dark.

3. The password is Alpha Limbo Tango, but only when the screen is yellow.

4. That warm draft is, in fact, breath. Don't turn around.

5. Your daughter is dead. She has been for years.

6. Your uniform is the one that looks right. No, you don't really want to know what happened to the others. Yes, that is blood. Keep moving.

7. Eat. You'll need the energy.

8. There is no person down there with you. You are on your own. Ignore all cries for help and all offers of assistance.

9. You are deathly allergic to the chemicals in that vat. Try not to spill them.

10. First push the button, THEN pull the lever. 

11. No, we don't know exactly when you'll wake up. Just that you will. In either a millennia, or whenever the surface is safe for habitation again.

12. DO NOT LOOK AT THE OTHER CHAMBERS. You WILL break down. It WILL start again. We cannot afford to lose any more of you.

13. The black strap goes under your chin, the white across the forehead.

"I'm not afraid of dying. Its basically already happened, I have terminal cancer. I'm relieved that my endless days of laying in a bed are finally over. I've come to terms with the fact that there may be nothing after death. That I was deliberately put last in line for a life saving treatment, and that even though I was told that I was making incredible bounds towards a miraculous recovery, but today my blood is full of poison. At the very least my wife would get a million dollar pay out from my life insurance. I don't fear the reaper.

"Imagine a hat you can’t take off— goggles you can’t remove— stockings and gloves permanently fixed to your legs and hands— a full lycra bodysuit strapped tightly to you twenty-four hours a day. Now imagine the whole lot doused in itching powder. That’s my life. 

I have a very rare skin disorder. My skin will not stop itching. 

The private nurse comes round every evening. I lay naked in bed and she lubes me up in some steroid and for twenty minutes exactly I feel almost normal. I watch the clock the whole time.

I’m contemplating suicide. 

I’ve had my life now and I find that the sickness I’m suffering is even beginning to negatively effect my family. 

The other day my daughter Gillian brought my three-year-old grandson Carson to visit. She left him with me for five minute while she went to the bathroom. Somehow in that time my lack of mental awareness due to the interminable itching allowed little Carson to get up from his chair, fall at my bed and bash his mouth against the bedrail. 

When Gillian got back there was blood everywhere. She had to rush Carson away to the emergency room and I’m told he got butterfly stitches on his lower lip. 

I felt so guilty. A little smear of Carson’s blood had found its way to my forearm, which had been resting helplessly by the rail when the accident happened. 

\*\*\*

Last night the spot where Carson’s blood made contact with the skin of my forearm began to blister. I was too tired even to call my medical provider. I slept and hoped the blisters would go away.  

I was woken in the small hours of the morning by a strange sensation. The blisters had opened into small, weeping slits. In all honesty the way they felt distracted me like nothing else ever had from my itching. 

I watched as the slits in the blisters on my arm grew tiny protrusions and as the tiny protrusions became lips. I watched as the slits deepened and as, on the inside, they grew minuscule rows of perfectly formed teeth and tongues the size of pink threads. 

\*\*\*

Carson is well again. The little laceration on his face has healed nicely. I asked for some private time with my grandson and Gillian reluctantly agreed. We’ve padded the bedrail with rubber just to be sure. 

Carson stands by my bed and I show him the little mouths in the skin of my arm. 

“Little mouths,” he says in his baby talk voice, and he kisses them. 

They kiss him back and the feeling I get is electric, ecstatic. 

Imagine feeling utter bliss in one portion of your body and utter misery in all the rest. 

That feeling is enough to drive anyone insane. 

I have taken the syringe from under my pillow. 

As Carson innocently kisses the kissing mouths in my arm, I slide the needle into the throbbing veins of his neck.",shortscarystories

"You’re going to hear a lot of stories about me.

Please take my word when I tell you that none of them are true.

I’ve been called a lot of things across the centuries, but there hasn’t been a flattering one since humanity was young, just a babe barely out of it's cradle.

I used to be seen as a guardian angel. I was loved by villages, given offerings of fruit and wine, celebrated in the festivals of the summer. I loved my humans as much as they loved me.

And I would have done anything for them. I’d patrol the fields, keeping the live stock safe from predators. I'd help them sow their fields in the spring, and harvest in the fall.

I’d even stand in the woods by their homes, my imposing figure eating up the night’s sky, and stop intruders from taking their children.

The thing is that no one, not even a supernatural being, is perfect. Even I made mistakes. I arrived at scenes too late, to find nothing but a bloody blanket torn to shreds in a crib.

I’d come to screaming mothers just in time to see one of my enemies taking off with their babies.

Pretty soon they began blaming me, it was easier to blame the friend you knew than the enemy you didn’t. They stopped with the offerings, and threw stones when I came around town. I stopped being able to protect them, so the crimes I was being blamed for only increased.

I stopped going out in the day, and kept to the forest. Sometimes I’ll still watch your house. Longing to be a part of your community again.

But I’ll never be accepted among you again, not as long as the legends of Slenderman continue to be passed down through the generations.",shortscarystories
"Nana found a hairless stray cat. She found it in a bag. Below her street and beside a bin. She took it home, for three days, nurturing her friend. When visiting, Nana was seen sitting on her chair. Rocking. Hand petting purring cat.

“Nana, how are you?” asking Sister Lisa.

Nana's head flopping over. Eyes flickering. Jaw sagging. Groaning in response. We are stepping over loose newspapers and emptying tins. Lisa - **SCREAMING!** She is tiptoeing like dancing to jazz. Cockroaches scattering below. I’m feeling blood rushing to ears.

“Nana, can you hear me?” Sister’s voice is reaching across the room like gentle touching.

“Uuuuhraarghckk …” spit then drooling from Nana’s mouthing. But as she is speaking in a wobbling melody, her cat begins meowing. They’re singing? Nana goes again but her body flinching, shoulder twitching to move. “**UuUuUuhhhhargck**”

&amp;#x200B;

“What’ happening?” Lisa is hissing - her shoulders pointing and hands curling beneath chin. House dropping silent. My sister’s body itching, as it was, to flee. “Are they words?”

Were they … do we ask her to speak again? To repeat the pain she’s feeling. Seeing one of nana’s eyes staring back beneath layers of pale flesh. My throat tightening. How she is watching from that creaking chair – while hand continuing to twine around cat’s fur.

Our breathing rocking. Breeze flattering papers. Tin cans rolling – and the cat purring while rising onto paws. Nana’s eyes pointing downward. Then making noises once more, only shorter. I step forward as Lisa starts moving for the door. Heart pounding as I am watching the cat begin digging.

“Mama!” Lisa shouting out of the house. “Help!”

&amp;#x200B;

Finding strength, nana’s nails clawing armchair. Her voice groaning as the cat is clawing. Digging. Down into her abdomen. I’m moving closer to give her a hand. But each step I find that cat crawling into its hole. Somewhere inside nana.

Once more is silence. I am looking into a darkening hole. Torn clothing. Nana’s body stiff. Her eyes still flickering to those odd sensations. Rotting smell lingering. Taking one more step and finding the cat’s tail hanging out abdomen …

“Come outside.” Calling mama from the door. She’s waving me out Nana’s smelly house. There’s a phone to her ear as she’s calling an ambulance or police … or priest? Later we’re told she died. Leaving in her tracks were kittens – and all 6 were put to death.

*Nana had a stroke before we visited, and so the cat started nesting in her body for survival …*",shortscarystories
"The wet pitfall must've been fifty feet deep with walls sharp like cut teeth, a stone throat opening in the middle of the marsh. Pierre attempted to climb to freedom, but several slips tore his hands to ribbons and broke his tailbone. The hole was only wide enough for him to pace in a circle with one leg free, the other acted as a pivot in the middle. 


*How did I get here?*


""Hullo? Is anyone there?"" His voice reverberated upward and faded into the dull, cloudy sky. 


The mysterious reason for his imprisonment grounded Pierre. He had woken up naked and sore, covered in welt-like bruises with bloody slits, as if demonic eyes covered his flesh.


""Hullo?!"" 


A rancid smell, one of rot and filth, overwhelmed him as sloshes of dead chickens, liquified pig slop, and molded fruit covered him in a hail of garbage. Pierre gagged and fell to the assault of expiration. 


When the sepulchre's storm finally stopped, a jovial laugh fell from the cloudy entrance.


""Oh ho ho, *mon cher ami*, have you enjoyed my hospitality?"" 


A black shape peeked out from outside down to the covered Pierre.


""I hope you do not mind the gifts *mon Seigneur*. It was hard for a man of—how did you put it—'little consideration' to find joys that match you.""


Pierre cut his hand further using the walls to prop himself; sloppy sluice seeped into his wounds.


""You—you are the son of Gosse!"" Pierre's hand shook with a pointed finger. ""Free me of this Hell or I shall gut you for treason!""


The son laughed with a *tsk tsk tsk*, ""that is no way to treat a host *mon ami*, you should know better than that.""


Pierre started sobbing. His salty tears made soft *plunk* sounds while *hics* bounced upward to the son. 


""Son of Gosse! Dear, old Goss—""


""Oh ho! He is 'dear' now? Before he was 'rat!'

""'Rat Family.' That is the name you gave us. My father cleaned your floors as you kicked and mocked him. 'A man like a rat, snout down on all fours.' I might've been only seven but your words still fill my dreams.

""And I did some thinking *mon Seigneur*. You were right. After you killed my father and mother, all I had left were rats as family.

""So I hope you don't mind my ruse, *mon ami:* The gift was not the garbage earlier, that was simply the bait. The real gift is you!

""A gift to *mon 'Famille de Rat*.'""


As the laugh began to shift further away, loud clangs of traps opening rang down to Pierre. And with great horror, Pierre saw a wave of black fur move with great voracity towards him. A sharp pain of teeth surged in Pierre's bleeding flesh. He tore at the black shape, but more fell upon him until Pierre could not keep up with the legion. And with greedy squeaks, a wash of red eyes tore the exhausted Pierre apart.",shortscarystories

"Invisibility - we did something about that, beyond mirrors and tricks of light. Three men were the subjects in a glass chamber, their affairs already in order. They hoped every atom in their body would dematerialise, sending them to another realm so far untapped by man. Yet when the cloud of chemicals cleared, only a pile of fleshy goo remained. A hand and an eyeball were the only parts whole in the mess.

Only two of their DNAs were identified. The chamber was otherwise empty.

Soon the occurrences started. A mug or a clipboard would seem misplaced; a series of doors would open in sequence; certain alarms would go off by itself in the middle of the night with nobody around. On certain days, if you walked through the right spot at the right time, you would hear a blast of noise momentarily – almost like the sound made when you flip through television channels quickly before the characters speaking can finish their sentence. 

Everyone who encountered the random noise would wince and pull away quickly, brisk walking elsewhere. It was only when someone decided to stay and listen to it when they realised it was human speech, in the voice of the one unidentified subject.

It was more than audible, but it wasn’t screaming. Those who heard it agreed with each other. It was a broken, stoic voice that spoke for the sake of speaking, a voice that only comes when someone has seen too much, a voice that has long deserted hope and desperation, a voice that only mumbled the same sentence over and over again –

“Bring me back. Bring me back. No more. No more. *Please*.”",shortscarystories
"Mister Swigglebottoms pressed his lips into a thin line, but Lady Puffingsnatch held the ceramic cup against them anyway. The tea inside scalded them. It climbed up the hairs of his mustache.

“Drink up,” she said, “you naughty, willful boy.”

But drink up, he would not. The reflection she made in his white, white eyes made Lady Puffingsnatch smile. Perfectly groomed, she was. A lion would envy her mane of golden curls. The cardinals in Rome would trample one another for dye the red of her lips. Excalibur itself, swinging wildly in Arthur's glory, couldn’t shine more brightly than her cheese knife.

The shine twinkled out of Mister Swigglebottoms’ eyes when she brought it to his throat. She massaged his neck with the flat of it. Its coolness combined with the heat of his blood, rushing just below the skin, to condense beads of pure water on the silver. They dripped onto his collar.

“You silly, vexing man!” said Lady Puffington. “Why must you spurn my gift of dreams, when you know what awaits shan’t be nearly as sweet?”

Not a muscle of his twitched. Not a blink broke his stare into the dark of her eyes.

She removed the cup then, and set it down upon her pink table, between the frills of yellowing lace.

“How tiring,” she said, and brought the knife down as well, to polish the damp from it. Its gleam was hidden for a moment in a fold of her dress. She’d chosen her best one, the one with roses on the hem.

But run, Mister Swigglebottoms did not; though his limbs dangled, untethered and loose.

“You weary me, Mister Swigglebottoms,” Lady P said when she saw, with a sigh as delicate as spring. “If you refuse in your obstinance to drink my sweet tea, and reject so resolutely the chance I gave you, then, to dance, I shall feel no pity for you. The devil take a sinful heart like yours.”

The cheese knife wasn’t sharp, but it pierced his heart in one stroke. His guts spilled over the tea service.

Then, from the door behind, came her mother.

“Good, you got dressed. They’re here - your aunt brought the baby.” She gasped, then, and ran to her. “What did you to Elephant? You know he was your Grandma’s.” She picked up Mister Swigglebottoms and checked him for tears. The stitches were opened where his belly met his head.

“Sorry, Mom,” said Lady Puffington. She blinked beneath her bangs.

Mother didn’t answer but made noises through her nose. Lady Puffington watched her gather the stuffing from the table and push it back down Swigglebottoms’ throat.

“Go,” Mother said at last. “They’re waiting for you.”

So Lady Puffington smoothed her skirt, poured the tea into its bottle, and flounced like dandelion puffs do, but down the stairs.

“Who wants to have a tea party?” she sang, over the sound of cheerful greetings. “I’ve been practicing.”",shortscarystories
"Every night I hear my mother through the walls.

She never talks during the day, only at night. Like clockwork she begins at midnight, and abruptly stops at 6:00am. I've heard everything from harsh whispers, playful talking, cackling and even screaming. Some of the things I hear her say frighten me. Dark and dreadful things.  I go to check on her, but when I enter, silence. She just rocks in her chair.

I can't take it anymore.

I moved in with her a week ago. After the hospital called, I knew I had to come back home. The doctor told me she had been suffering from seizures these past few years, and they were getting worse. My mother needed full time care, and I volunteered. 

Even though she has always been estranged, and I hadn't seen her in a decade, I knew she needed me. But... it's gotten too much. 

She scares me.

She doesn't even eat, and I've tried and tried, but she won't open her mouth. I've tried to get her out of her bedroom, or atleast out of her chair but she gets aggressive. So I have been bathing her right where she sits. She doesn't mind much, she just rocks in her chair, mindlessly smiling at her closet.

She does this all day.

I can handle caring for her throughout the day, creepy as it is, but the night... I can't anymore.

Today I gave in, I went to her doctor for help. I told him that she's keeping me awake, whispering and talking. I told him it's getting too much and she's starting to scare me. 

What the doctor said next scared me even more...

""Your mother bit off her tongue years ago... she can't talk.""",shortscarystories
"“Thank you for making coffee.” I say to my wife, even though it tastes horrible.

“She knows I hate hazelnut blends.” I think to myself taking another sip. I must pretend everything is normal if I want my plan to work. I look at my watch, I should have at least twenty more minutes.

Our fighting had made the mornings extremely awkward.

She decided to GPS track the location on my phone when she was mandated to work night shifts. My late-night trips to the casinos and red-light district had brought on an epic fight.

“Did you see there’s another missing prostitute?” she asked glaring over her tablet as she turned it for me to see. “Was she one of the ones you liked?”

I try to give her a disarming smile to hide my relief. I take another sip of the coffee and hide my grimace at the taste. She seemingly picks this up and gives a passive aggressive smirk knowingly.

“I told you before, I didn’t have sex with anyone other than you.” I look to my watch, fifteen minutes, I take a larger swig of the coffee planning my exit.

“I don’t believe you… Were you doing this even when I worked days?” she inquired setting the tablet down “Paying for women to sleep with you while I laid here untouched?” tears in her eyes now from the pain.

She would never believe me, but I honestly didn’t have sex with any of them… Albeit I did touch them. Binding them up and carving sections of their bodies off; torturing them as if they were my wife.

It was the only way to handle her passive aggressiveness without hurting her.

Honestly, I was thinking of her the whole time, but she wouldn’t understand. Now her insecurities had provided rock solid evidence placing me at the location of several of the bodies.

Her stupid insecurities triggered a series of events leading up to what I had to do this morning.

I look at her and tried to give a compassionate smile, taking her in. It would be the last time I saw her alive and I wanted to remember her.

“Look, I have to get to work, we can talk more when I get home.” I look to my watch, only eight minutes left.

I take the remaining coffee in one full gulp. It’s so bad that it’s giving me heartburn.

As I stand, I become dizzy and nauseous. I steady myself on the table and chair.

The taste in my mouth… it wasn’t hazelnuts it was almonds…

I look to my wife, holding back the vomit building in my throat. She’s smiling.

“Oh dear… when I said my first two husbands left… I meant they left this world… Nobody cheats on Me!” Her smile vicious as I begin to vomit and shake, finally falling to the floor.

I take a final look at my watch… four minutes.

I wonder if she’ll smell the gas before the explosion.",shortscarystories
" ***It might be said:***

As  the storm howled on, drenching him, he pierced the heavens with his  anguish. The humiliation of imprisonment stung more than the raindrops  pelting his face. It rekindled in him memories of his past life. These  were the times when he yearned for freedom the most and  when the bounds  of his cage became unbearable. But what could he do save bear it, for  not even death was an escape. Still, ***he held out hope for salvation***, and maybe one day he'd be worthy of it, but this was not that day. So instead, he contented himself with solitude.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What  a strange lot his captors were, they were devilishly kind to the extent  of being cruel in a peculiar way. They did not physically accost him,  save when necessary, and they did not psychologically harangue him, or  verbally abuse him. They only required he maintain his health and never  leave the temple. He chuckled as he recalled the first time he had  realized the insidiousness concealed within this harmless request. The  monks were shrewd indeed. Simply, they had sentenced him to be bate,  intending to ensnare assailants, that intruded upon the temple, for  revenge, doubtlessly, with him as their prize. Often, he would be absent  of the whens and wheres of these confrontations, but he always knew the  whys. The assailants blamed him for much; ***his creations were a great source of pain***.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Lightning  split the sky as thunder deafened an ominous approach. Retribution had  come. An assailant lurched behind the scientist, gripping a knife, ""this  is for all the lives you've stolen,"" he snarled. Before the scientist  could rebuttal, the intruder skewered him multiple times. In the  aftermath, the storm shied away and the clouds parted. ***Vengeance was his***.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As  the rain lifted, moonlight graced the temple's courtyard. Its worn tile  floor, now a glistening crimson, ridiculed the intruders efforts. For  he had endeavored to dispense justice only To bear witness to his own  sacrilege. Clones don't kill clones, not since the war ended, yet he had  belied that edict. Disbelief crippled him as he reexamined the  scientist. There was no mistaking it, he was a clone. The intruder wept  silently, unaware that the monks had started to surround him, though,  they did not attack him. Instead, they called to him, he answered with  his gaze, and was met by disbelief; ***they were clones too***. A hand extended to him.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The  monks then encircled the scientist's body and dragged him off of the  courtyard to a room deep within the temple. They hoisted the scientist  onto a table, dressed his wounds, and revitalized him. Eventually, the  scientist's body spring back to life. He snatched air in gulps as he  reoriented himself. The room's familiarity was jarring; they had brought  him back! Once he realized this, he ambled to his feet only to  collapse. There was no escape. ""***Please, no more… let me die,***"" he whimpered, but his pleas were rebuked; They dragged him away.",shortscarystories

"Since I was 18 I have lived alone, but decided to move home to my mom after a few years to save money as well as we really enjoy each other's company. We live in a small apartment in a big city, which is a little cramped for two people, but nevertheless has its charm and is obviously nice to have. Since I was a teenager I have struggled with sleep, both struggling to fall asleep and stay asleep. For the most part, I have nightmares every single night that I remember down to the smallest detail in awakened state - both taste, smell, colors, mood and surroundings.

Two years ago I was laying in my bed, sleeping soundly. Nothing particularly had happened that day, I had been at work as usual and relaxed at home in the evening. All of a sudden, I woke up to someone pulling my foot lightly. It wasn't a hard pull, it was as if someone took a grip around my ankles and pulled with normal force, as if to wake me up. I stiffened and became terrified and instinctively pulled my feet up under me. No one else was in the room with me and I heard my mom sleeping in the room next door. I don't remember anything else, and I must have fallen asleep pretty quickly after that. Then I woke up again, but this time I am standing in my bed, straight up and down, and looking up at the ceiling as I scream without a sound. I saw myself from the outside as if I had an astral projection, and it looked horryfing. My face had stuck in a spine-chilling grimace and I remember how I stood there screaming without a sound. What I was screaming for I have no idea, but that night was absolutely awful and I had to sleep in my mom's room for several weeks after this incident.",shortscarystories
"Something lives deep in the woods where I grew up. Most people only talk about it in hushed whispers, nervously glancing over their shoulders. The rest use it as a cautionary tale, warning their children not to venture too deep into the trees there.

My parents were the latter. They used the legend as a way to keep me out of the forest behind our house. I always got a laugh from their warning. I knew things like that didn’t exist. Yet they would swear by it. “The Patchwork Man walks tonight. He’ll steal your children and taint their souls.”

Yeah, right. Tell me another one. I wasn’t a naive child. I was a street-smart teenager; they couldn’t fool me with their fairytales and lies.

It didn’t matter that they wove tales of an entity so depraved that not one adult would set foot near the forest at night. The fact he was said to slip past lit windows searching for his next victims to play with didn’t bother me; it wasn’t real. A creature who stole the flesh from children’s bones wasn’t something that existed. It was only a campfire story, nothing more.

So I decided to prove them all wrong. Everyone told me not to look for him. I was only inviting danger because once he’s set his sights on you, nothing would stop him. I didn’t listen. I had to prove to them how wrong they were.

Now I know the truth. I was the one who was wrong. Everything you have heard about the Patchwork Man is true. He is your worst nightmare, personified. The stories people tell are but a pale reflection of what he truly is. I know this. I know it very well.

I’m now one of the damned who lingers in these woods, my life snuffed out by he who dwells within. I issue this warning; lock your doors, keep your lights on, and hold your children close. The Patchwork Man walks tonight.",shortscarystories
"They threw Romirez in the hole pretty much immediately.

White walls, concrete floors, fluorescent lights that never shut off. Solitary confinement.

I took pity on him, I guess. Slipped him an old dog-eared paperback from the prison library. A short story collection by Mark Twain. He wasn’t supposed to have it, in case he somehow fashioned a weapon out of it – these inmates can be industrious, believe me – but it helped me sleep at night, knowing he had something to do.

He took a real shine to it, reading the thing over and over, licking his finger with every page turn, until the binding started coming loose.

There was one story he seemed to like particularly.

A funny little story about a jingle that gets stuck in the author’s head:

*Conductor, when you receive a fare,*
*Punch in the presence of the passenjare!*
*A blue trip slip for an eight-cent fare,*
*A buff trip slip for a six-cent fare,*
*A pink trip slip for a three-cent fare,*
*Punch in the presence of the passenjare!*
*Punch, brothers! punch with care!*
*Punch in the presence of the passenjare!*

The jingle’s so catchy, the author finds himself unable to think of anything else. He can’t write, can’t carry a conversation, can’t even remember what he ate for breakfast. The only way he can find relief is by passing the jingle along to someone else. Then they’re hooked, and he’s free.

A silly little story.

But Romirez didn’t see it that way. He crouched there in the hole, rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet, repeating the lines over and over.

Sometimes barely more than a whisper: “Punch, brothers, punch with care.”

And sometimes a full-throated shout: “PUNCH IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PASSENJARE!”

He tried to teach it to me, but I mixed up words – getting the colours wrong, or the fares, and whenever I made a mistake, he’d slip into a rage.

I had to learn all the words, or he’d get no relief.

At some point, the other guards found out about the book. I got reprimanded, and they eliminated what little human contact they’d given him before.

They slipped his food in through a slot in the door, and hosed him down once a month.

Otherwise he was alone. Alone with the earworm.

*Punch, brothers, punch with care. Punch in the presence of the passenjare.*

***

It was me that found him. No one else’d checked on him for a few days.

He’d beat his head against the wall until his skull cracked. Must’ve taken a while. On the walls, in blood, he’d written the verses of the jingle. That was how I finally learned the words.

You know, the words I shared with you above? Did you read through a few times? Get them stuck in your head a bit?

They sure got stuck in mine, once I learned them all. Couldn’t think of much else.

Until I shared them with you.",shortscarystories
"Felicia Omen thought it was strange, the note taped to her window. She found it in the morning, her eyes still blurry from sleep, and came closer to read it.

I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE, the note promised in permanent marker. I’M COMING FOR YOU. DON’T TRY TO RUN. DON’T CALL THE POLICE. LIVE LIKE THERE’S NO TOMORROW, BECAUSE TODAY IS YOUR LAST.

Felicia stood upright, her heart thudding in her ribcage. Her first instinct was to call the police, but she shuddered to think what might happen if she disobeyed her stalker’s wishes. What if he killed her and moved on to her family? It was much safer, Felicia thought, to remain in her home and prepare. She had the materials, after all. Yes. Block him outside, and remain in here until she could think of her next move.

She locked all the doors in the house: the back door, front door, garage door, checking the windows as she went. No one was outside, or at least no one that was visible. She suspected her stalker might be watching from the shadows, of course he was, but she could see no one no matter where she searched.

There were several 2x4’s stacked in her art studio, and tools in the garage. Felicia started with the windows, hefting the boards at awkward angles and nailing them into the wall. The house had several windows, but after countless hours of work, they were all boarded shut. Then came the doors, and once she ran out of wood, she resorted to using chains, wrapping them meticulously around the doorknobs and tying them to the walls. She unscrewed all the vents and shoved cinderblocks as far as she could reach. For the chimney – in case her stalker made a rather festive entrance – she arranged an armchair into the fireplace, blocking the shaft. She worked late into the day, and eventually the night, only pausing to brush sweat from her brow.

At some late hour Felicia backed away to admire her handywork, standing in the center of the living room with her hands on her hips. The room was by now very bare, and unhomely, but she was certain no one was getting in or out. That was when she noticed the note, still visible through a slat in the boards.

In all her shock, she hadn’t noticed the way it was fixed. The note had been taped to the inside of the window. Whoever had put it there had been inside the house. Felicia hardly had time to react before the knife was brought down into her back. She managed to pull away, gasping in pain, but found herself confronted with only locks, chains, and boarded windows. The knife was brought down thirty-seven more times before Felicia could no longer feel it, and even more after that.",shortscarystories
"The news outlets had a field day when the world realized what was happening. An old man on his deathbed suddenly feeling better with every day that passed, the 13 year old girl who had finally made it to womanhood stopped getting her time of the month, hell, the golden retriever down the road started doing tricks like he was a puppy again. 

No one knew why it was happening, but everyone seemed to be getting younger with time. My grandmother was psyched. See, my grandfather has dementia, and yesterday he remembered who she was! They had a chance to live their lives over again. 

My husband and I, on the other hand, were a different story. It took us three years to get pregnant with our son, and as I sit in his nursery holding onto our newborn, I wonder how much time we have left with him.",shortscarystories
"One for sorrow.

""Jeremy Ficus is a creep!"" The girl yelled behind her as she ran, to the ire of the boy who chased her. They ran through the local forest, like two magpies flying free in the sky.

Two for joy.

""Shut up Melody! Am not!"" The boy reached for her but stumbled and missed, sending the girl into a fit of giggles.

Three for a girl.

A rock flew threw the air. The girl crumpled, her wings suddenly clipped.

Four for a boy.

It was the boy's turn to giggle. He had shot just right.

Five for silver.

Blood was everywhere. On the forest floor. On Jeremy's clothes. To the boy, it was nothing but simple feathers.

Six for gold.

The small girl didn't move, nor breath. She was no more. 

Seven for a secret.

Her body was dragged deeper into the forest, the boy pulling it behind him like a bird carrying it's prey.

Never to be told.

He hid her well he did. Hauled her to a fort, hidden in a tall tree. 

Eight for a wish.

There, he cleaned the body and pealed the skin. Plucking the feathers as he said.

Nine for a kiss.

He dissected her carefully. Piece by piece. He didn't want to ruin his new specimen. 

Ten for a bird.

He hung the skin out to dry. Then placed each organ in a jar, labeled it, and placed it on a shelf next to others like itself.

You must not miss.

After that, he rid himself of the left overs. He placed them on the roof for the birds. An offering to them. Maybe, one day, if he gathered enough specimen, they'd grant him the wish of joining them in the sky.",shortscarystories

"Every break at school Timmy would spend his time drawing with his sidewalk chalk.

He would always works on the same drawing.

That's not surprising, considering that the drawing was as big as the entire school yard.

No one really cared about Timmy, they just assumed he was doing his thing and leave him alone with his crayons.

He would work on it every day at school, this meant that the drawing would fade during the weekend and he had to restart.

Rain and the other kids were also a problem.

The rain would wash away all his hard work and the other kids sometimes ruined his drawing for fun.

They especially loved to push his face down on the pavement and rub it over his work.

Timmy had gotten used to it, just like how he had gotten used to being called names, getting drinks spilled on him or being punched.

Timmy had other things to do.

Sometimes this would lead to Timmy sitting in the rain while the other kids stayed inside.

His knees would be soaked and every line he drew would be washed away by the rain the next second.

When the sidewalk chalk would be getting to short his hands would scrape against the pavement and tear of parts of his flesh, leaving his hands open and bleeding at the end of the break.

Not that anyone cared about Timmy.

No one cared, until his drawing was finished.

But they didn’t care about Timmy, no they didn’t even care when they found him lying dead in the middle of the school yard sized drawing.

They only cared because they finally saw what Timmy had been drawing.

As Timmy’s blood began to soak into the chalk on the pavement the lines of the drawing began to give off a soft glow and strange symbols flashed to live.

They only cared because a demon had appeared inside the summoning circle.",shortscarystories

"I slept late that night. My doorbell rang at a time that I didn’t know. It was obvious that the person who knocked on the door was in fear. My curiosity didn't surprise me so I went to the door with feeling sleepy. I looked through the door, but all I saw was darkness. 

I said, ""Who is it?""

“Can you help me?”

In her voice, I could tell something was wrong. It was like something was chasing her, and her life depends on me opening the door. Still, I couldn't open the door without knowing the name of someone who knocked on my door at this time of night. She could be anyone.

“Please tell me who you are and why did you knock on my door at this time,” I said. I've never had a situation like this. But I was still calm.

**“I am you…”**

I woke up.

I had no idea where I was.

I didn't know the time.

I couldn't see anything.

I started to walk. I was walking uneasily as if someone was chasing me.

I had a strange feeling. Weirdly, it felt familiar. So I followed that feeling. Until I get to an apartment. The apartment was in the woods but still close the city.  I decided to go inside. The feeling was telling to me. Therefore there was nothing I could do except rely on this feeling because I didn’t remember anything. I checked the entrance door and it was open. So I went in. I knocked on someone's door with curiosity and fear in my eyes. 

“Who is it?” She said. 

I said, ""Can you help me?"".

“Please tell me who you are and why you did knock on my door at this time.” The voice said.

Suddenly I started to remember things.

That sound... 

This place…

This door...

""I... I am you and this is my house.” I said. 

The strange but familiar feeling brought me home.

"Day 1

I still can’t truly believe it. But then again, who could possibly believe they would see the planet they called home destroyed and live to tell about it. The feel and sound from the Sun’s explosion in the distance is indescribable. But we reached Mars. We terraformed a fraction of the planet and have hope for a future. The artificial sun provides the light and heat we need, the lake and water generators allow us to drink, nourish the crops and the livestock give us food and a sense of familiarity on this foreign land. This is Day 1 of the post Solar world.

Day 3

Everyone is cooperating. No arguing, no egos, no judgements. It’s a beautiful sight to behold, I believe this event has given us a new appreciation of life. 

Day 6

The excessive iron levels in the soil has made it nearly impossible to grow crops. We’ve discovered an area of land, about 2 football fields in size, where the toxicity is low enough that crops can grow. Crisis averted.

Day 10

The couple who settled on the fertile lands when we first arrived are now demanding livestock as payment to use ‘their land’. Some foolish people have actually begun doing this, but I won’t condone such madness. 

Day 12

The couple have hired people to monitor the land with promise of extra food. They discovered the seeds I planted and dug them up. I also witnessed a man trespassing on the land today and he was brutally beaten by these new guards. At least I have my livestock.

Day 15

This is insanity. The people who settled along the lake when we arrived are now building a fence along the lakefront. They are demanding food in return for water access. 

Day 20

Mobs have broken out across the land. Some targeting the fertile lands, some targeting the lake front. People are desperate. I saw one couple trying to exchange their child for food, they had run out of livestock to give. The paid guards from both sides put down the uprisings. No trial will be had here. The guards quickly carried out execution of all involved. During the commotion I was able to sneak down to the lake and fill my buckets. Today I cried when the water reached my lips. How has it come to this? 

Day 30

The controllers of land and water are allowing people to work in exchange for the food and water they desperately need. I used my final chicken for water, this may be my last chance at survival.

Day 45

Somebody set fire to the fertile lands last night and used the farmed excess iron to poison the water supply. Even with the impending doom, the controllers of land and water won’t free us from our servitude. Rumors have spread that they’ll use us like livestock now. We brought everything  needed to succeed in this new world. Unfortunately, we also brought man.",shortscarystories
"""How old are you?!"" 


I screamed at the strange man who was cowering in the corner of my dining-room. He didn't answer, so I waved my knife and repeated. 


""I said, HOW OLD ARE YOU?!!""


""Twentyy-fffive.""


""Do you smoke?...DO YOU SMOKE?!""


""No, no! Please..please let me go.""


.....


I guess I should explain.


Last night, I got a call;


""Mrs. Newton?""


""Yes, who's this?""


""Mrs. Newton, my name is Paula Sullivan, from Granted-Wish-Enterprises, I'm calling in regards to your application.""


""My application?""


""That's right, I just need to ask you a few questions before we can move forward...Are you free to talk?"" She seemed nice. 


""I'm sorry but, you must have the wrong person, I haven't applied for anything.""


""Oh-okay, one second please, let me just, see what we have here...""


I couldn't hear any noises, but I assumed she was checking their database.


""Ah yes, here we are, your application was made earlier today at 07:14am, location; bedroom. Client, that's you, states; ""*I wish you would hurry up and fucking die already.*"" which was in reference to your spouse, Mr. Lewis Newton. Do you remember making said statement, Mrs Newton?""


It was impossible for any one to have heard me say that...it was only me and my husband in the house. I remembered how utterly pissed off I was when I said it, too.


Thirty four years of marriage, and thirty four years of ""snoring-husband-induced-insomnia.""


Lewis was diagnosed with cancer 3months ago. He had a good job and some of the finest life insurance around. It covered just about everything, and in the event of his death, not only would the life insurance pay out, but his firm would have to also.


Last week, Lewis miraculously recovered. That week was not without its loss though; his brother, James, was found stabbed to death in his home.


""I'm sorry, who did you say you work for again?""


""My name is Paula and I'm from Granted-Wish-Enterprises.""


""Granted, wish, enterprises?...And who is that exactly?""


""Mrs Newton, it isn't *who* we are, it's *what* we are, and *what* we can do for our clients. We offer a service that, well, in as simplist form as possible, grants them their wish.""


""So you think my wish is for my husband to die?"" I kind of chuckled at the end.


""According to our records, Mrs Newton...yes.""


""But...I said that...I was alone when,""


""We take pride in our customer service...we listen to *all* of our clients...Would you like to continue, Mrs Newton?""


""Okay...let's say I carry on with this...how much exactly will this cost me?""


""*Exactly?*...Let me just check that for you...for the death of one, Mr Lewis Newton, we require; one eyeball and six knife wounds to the torso from a non-smoking male in his twenties.""


There was an awkward silence between us while I quickly contemplated the thought of my husband dead, and me laying sound asleep atop a bed of money.


""...Mrs Newton?""


""Hm?""


""Are you interested in continuing with the application?""",shortscarystories
"...over the edge of the concrete platform into the abyss.

I am falling. Pain wracks my body from head to toe. The taste of copper fills my mouth, and my left arm is broken in three places. Thin strips of flesh are the only things keeping my right ear attached to the side of my head. It flaps like a flag in the wind.

_We met in a park shortly after dusk._

_”You’ll find the pigeon in apartment 506,” he said. “Do the deed and meet me here at midnight. As agreed, we’ll pay you well.”_

_I nodded my head and rubbed my forearm. At that point, it was a matter of habit._

Spindly shapes rise up from the darkness. Scaffolding. I brace for the inevitable before my body slams into the series of steel metal tubes. Downward momentum treats me like a rag doll as I bounce back and forth. The word “pinball” comes to mind as I continue to cartwheel downwards.

_Weak in the knees, I jimmied the door to apartment 605. My target was fast asleep until my switchblade traced her throat from ear to ear._

_A child met me in the hall as I made my escape._

_”I had a bad dream, Mommy.”_

_I panicked. No one mentioned a child. Before she could cry for help, I tossed her through an open window._

My body spread-eagle, I crash through a series of skylights. The shattered glass slices the exposed parts of my flesh to ribbons. One thin sliver pierces my eye.

_We met at the appointed time. I knew something was wrong the moment I saw him._

_”You dumb junkie,” he spat. “You whacked the wrong broad.”_

_Before I could speak, he pressed a gun to my chest and squeezed the trigger. My vision faded as I fell backwards._

Below me, a small gray square comes into view. It quickly grows larger as I continue my descent. Dust rises as I slam into the platform. The impact knocks the wind out of me and I feel a number of ribs break. By some miracle, I am still alive. With great effort, I stand up. The pain is unbearable, and my legs are weak, but at least I have come to rest.

"There are two men on a life raft, bobbing along in the middle of the ocean. The broad and rolling waves bump them up, tilt them to the side, and deposit them back down into the trough. The rhythm of the ocean is unceasing.

Below the thin material of the bottom of the boat, there is water. Miles and miles and miles of dark water filled with unknowable things.

The men are sitting bolt upright in the seats, their rigid frames swaying in place as the ocean tosses them around. Their skins are stretched tight, puffed up and swollen with salt water. Their hair is falling out in clumps.

When the sun rises to a certain point in the sky, the dead men start talking in high pitched shrieks.

“*We got lucky!*”

“*Where’s the captain?*”

“*Dead.*”

“*Christ.*”

“*We got damn lucky.*”

The chatter continues, as it once did. Their rotting teeth clack and clink.

“*How are we doing on water?*”

“*Plenty of it.*“

The dead men laugh bitterly together.

“*What was that?*”

“*What was what?*”

“*That. There! In the water.*”

“*Narrow it down.*”

“*There’s something under the waves. I saw it.*”

Both men have something stuck in their lower backs: a kind of pulpy, slick, rope-like thing. It had pierced the skin and wedged itself firmly into their spines near the tail bones. The pulpy ropes, which look like off color strings of kelp, trail off over the side into the ocean depths. The pulpy ropes pulse with regular timing, like a jugular pumping blood.

“*I saw it too.*”

“*We’re gonna fucking die out here.*”

That night, they and their lifeboat bob along in silence.

The next day, the dead men tell their tale again to the empty sky and dark ocean.

“*We got lucky!*”

“*Where’s the captain?*”

“*Dead.*”

“*Christ.*”

“*We got damn lucky.*”

“*How are we doing on water?*”

“*Plenty of it.*“

The dead men laugh bitterly together.

“*What was that?*”

“*What was what?*”

“*That. There! In the water.*”

“*Narrow it down.*”

“*There’s something under the waves. I saw it.*”

"Aldrich had always been a highly perceptive, closely observant person. He never entered a room, area, or vehicle without taking note of his surroundings; mentally logging every item and person in relation to himself. He would’ve prided himself on this, if he were a prideful person. He exhibited a superb awareness, but was not paranoid.  

When, while walking down the street on an initially unremarkable day, he was struck in the chest by a bullet, he was fairly surprised. Even more so than the average person, who would of course be considerably shocked at the random, bloody eruption of their chest. Aldrich’s surprise was greater, because he hadn’t *seen* anyone wielding a gun. If he had, he would’ve taken note of it and left the area without hesitation.  

As he fell, he heard someone shout out, “Shit!”, which was followed by the straining engine and scraping tires of some quickly-sped vehicle. He even flinched, thinking the vehicle was on its way to bring him further harm. But the car fled away from him—he was not the intended target. 

He stared at a cloudless sky as he lay on his back, the warmth of his chest spreading through his body. There was a pain, but he sensed that his brain simply refused to acknowledge it. The sounds of the city changed. Cars came to screeching halts, women screamed, and footsteps seemed to thunder as if echoing off unseen walls. Aldrich’s view of the sky was abruptly blocked by several faces staring down in horror at him. He tried his best to visually capture their faces, even though their distress unsettled him. 

He thought he took note of them all, before the sky blackened and they became figures of shadow. 

He *awoke* standing, and although he knew he had been re-located elsewhere, he didn’t panic. It was obvious that he’d died, but while others would’ve instinctively recoiled from the seemingly infinite blackness around them, Aldrich felt elated. *There was so much space.* Even if it were devoid of matter, he would still delight in mentally charting its vacancy; establishing parameters where none had before.  

Theological and existential considerations presently ignored; Aldrich began his noctivagant exploration—not caring if he actually stumbled across anything. Ever-dedicated to his singular talent, and having no clothes or items to use as a marker, he removed a piece of himself and placed it at the spot of his arrival. This piece was nothing more than a handful of some cloud-like essence; and he assumed the rest of his body existed in this phantasmal state as well. 

Aldrich conducted a thorough survey, removing pieces of himself and placing them at intervals and imagined quadrants, zoning and mapping the void. Eventually, there were no pieces left to extract, and so ended his exploration. Scattered across the yawning nothingness, Aldrich, for the first time in a while, *reflected.* He looked upon himself through every piece, from every angle and perspective.  

Aldrich was happy. Aldrich was at peace. ",shortscarystories
"They’re fighting, downstairs in the house. Every day and every night the fighting. At this point, nobody is my savior. Father drinks himself stupid, then comes honestly every night and wanders the house like an animal.

I’ve got quite good at hiding that way, because failure to do so… well, you can probably guess what happens. Mother isn’t any better, though.

She will work all day, busy busy busy. There’s no time for her daughter in between endless phone calls. I’ve learned how to fend for myself and operate most things in the house, so as not to be yelled at.

The two of them fight often, loud enough to echo up through the floorboards and interrupt the little sleep I have before father’s inevitable arrival. The attic has some solace, a window provides moonlight and the wind brushes through the cracks in the old wood. It’s soothing to feel the breeze sometimes.

But, this place has a resident too. Someone I’m not keen on meeting, since I’ve been scared of her since I was small. She used to stare from the crooked hatch, coal-black eyes reflecting off of the hall lights. The memory of her still makes me shudder, but I have to endure.

Until the night is over, I cannot come down. So I’ll just have to deal with my silly fears.

Or so I think, until she shows up again.

A tall white woman, her body fusing to gather into a snake’s tail with silver scales. She’s unnaturally fast, those coal-black eyes staring as a grin stretches across her face. In moments she’s slithered around me, beautiful but horrifying at the same time. My body doesn’t know how to react, it seems. Or perhaps her icy-cold skin is freezing my joints.

*“hello.”* she hisses. *“remember meee?”*

“yes.” Years of abuse has taught me not to stutter.

*“ah, ssuch youth! sshame it took so long for you to come up.”*

“I don’t regret it.” Short simple sentences, it’s easier to hide fear that way. She seems to ignore my comment, continuing on with her ‘discussion’.

*“do you not hate those worthlessss beingss below?”*

“I do. But there’s no way I can take down a fully grown man and woman.”

*“then take a friend with you! ssome guidance.”*

“what are you suggesting?”

*“take thiss.”* She pulled a large butcher knife from somewhere. It glints beautifully in the moonlight in the only way a well-polished and sharpened knife can. *“I’ll help when you need it.”*

“…” I look at the weapon in my hand. It’s a chance, one that I may never receive again. I look at the hatch as it starts to creak open with a large unsteady hand.

"He stares. Into my windows at night. Stares with a knowing smirk, that I notice him. He's everywhere, he fills my nightmares. From January to December. I see his blue eyes and thick figure, just about everywhere I look. In the shower, out my classroom window, in my room. I ask others to look but no one else can spot him like I do. Elon Musk is stalking me and I don't know what to do. Everyday, I can feel the pull getting stronger, my desire strengthening. As his inviting, docile gaze scans my every inch from the shadows. Never closer than 50 feet, never farther than a few hundred. But, I know one thing. Despite what others say. He is there, and he is watching.",shortscarystories
"I keep my bedroom door open all the time, it makes me feel less claustrophobic which is a bit silly but its even open in my dreams

Although, in my dreams theres something at the end of the hall. It looks small like a silhouette of an animal, maybe a puppy? 

A few nights have passed and it's been creeping closer. I can tell it's not a puppy anymore, and it's not small

Whatever it is has glowing eyes and now that's it's closer I can see it has sharp claws and teeth 

A few more nights passed and it's nearly outside my bedroom. I decided to shut my door. I could hear it breathing and it was scratching on my door. I hate my dreams

When I woke up I opened my door and creepily enough it had scratch marks.. I'm definitely locking it tonight

I locked my door and hopped in bed and soon enough i fell asleep. I couldn't hear breathing or scratching but when I looked up at my door it was open..

Suddenly I could hear breathing from under my bed and something started to pull at my bedsheets

I don't know if it killed me but I'm surrounded in darkness. I can't wake up",shortscarystories

I mean, I get it, he’s upset that my mom and him had a falling out. But that doesn’t justify him following us when we moved into a new neighborhood. 

The new community was supposed to be “a fresh start,” according to Mom. But it’s pretty hard to start over when your dad has his car parked across the street from you all the time. Seriously. All. The. Time. 

I’m pretty sure he sleeps in the car. And one time, when we went to the block party, I swear he was recording our interactions with the neighbors. Like, I love the guy and all, but he needs to get a hobby. Start over, like Mom and I have. 

He’s tried to talk to me when Mom isn’t around. Wants me to come with him, which I always say no to. Why would I go with someone who’s basically my stalker? He’s also like, weirdly insistent that I stop going to church. How random is that?

I don’t care if we are blood related, because at the end of the day, the community is more important than any family member. When I ask her about Dad, Mom says that our problems don’t matter since we’ll all be Ascending soon anyway. I guess she’s right.

"Operation Fenrir was launched during the cold winter of 1944 by the Soviet Union.

The plan was simple, not wanting to wasit their own scarce resources on war prisoners they released the Nazis that were captured and allowed them to go home.

But not before they injected them with a custom made disease that was highly contagious. Once released the sick prisoners would go back to their homeland and infect others with the sickness.

The plan worked because 14 days after Operation Fenrir was launched the German Empire fell.

The same tactic was borrowed by the United States who used it 3 days later on their Japanese prisoners.

3 days later World War 2 had ended.

However the peace wouldn't last long because 2 weeks later,

"  

It was eleven in the night. The air was laden and the stars were masked by the thick, winter fog. The rats had gone to sleep hungry and angry at the paucity of food in that abode, and the spiders remained vigilant to latch onto the lone, lazy fly. Light, perhaps of a small bulb, trickled outside through the only window in that two-roomed stone cottage that lay right beside the abandoned cemetery. Inside, amid the faint light, there could be seen a broken stein on the floor beside a bottle. Its contents had been put to gainful use by the owner, and its paltry remnants, few drops of gin, had dribbled onto the stone floor. Frank, the owner, lay half-drunk on his bed, with another bottle in his hand, opened up and at the ready. He had tried to cure his addiction, and succeeded, too, for six months and twenty-seven days. Or, that’s what he had thought. The demons had returned. For the last six days, Frank’s natural instinct was waging a war against his will power with renewed vigour. 

*\*You have a curiosity that needs feeding, frank\**

*\*The cooking world needs you, frank. You aren’t ordinary. \**

*\*FORGET VITA, frank\**

And, in so many more ways, his thoughts had urged him to break his abstinence. But he had persisted. Vita’s memories had aided him well. And his own personal disgust of his addiction had amply supported him.

After six days of internal conflict though, Frank had realised the futility of it. As a last resort, he decided to get woefully drunk hoping that the alcohol-ridden half-stupor would render him weak; weak enough to thwart his carrying out of the addiction. It was, sadly, not enough. That retching feeling that he had dug up the rotting bodies in the cemetery for their flesh some years back was not enough. That he, having dug up all the bodies, had resorted to dismembering his village people to get fresh flesh was not enough. That his addiction, having chased away all of the folk in the town, the very source of luscious body parts, drove him to kill the only fresh body in the vicinity, his lovely, Vita, was not enough. He watched as his hands were casting away the bottle that he had been holding. He helplessly watched as his legs were picking themselves up from the bed, transporting him to a chest lying at the corner. He watched, sickened, as his hands were opening the clasp, pulling out onto the floor a rusty, blood-crusted hatchet, a leather apron, and a cooking pot.

Having lost the battle, Frank sensed his lips curling into a grin as he was forced to cut his left palm into the pot. He giddily watched the rats as they were coming out of their hiding, elated, at the prospect of having food again in the house finally. He knew that the spiders, too, were thinking the same. 

*\*Your finger fries are going be great, frank\**",shortscarystories
"It was 3:00am

I woke up to an itchy uncomfortable sensation in both my eyes. I tried to remember what had happened last night but all I remembered was that I had gone to a party and come home hungover. 

I realised it was probably because I had left my contacts on. In the dark I put my fingers up to my left eye, pulled down my lower eyelid and tried to pick out the contact lense. My eye started hurting and I quickly pulled my hand away

The contact lense had probably nudged itself really deep under my eyelid due to me sleeping in it. I tried the right eye and got the same result. 

This time I gritted my teeth and tried to pinch out my contact lenses once again. My whole eyeball erupted in sharp pain. I let out a yelp and moved my fingers away. On my fingers was a thin moist film. Do contact lenses have a plastic covering?

My left eye was now hurting like hell and my vision was hazy. *Screw it* I thought as I once again tried to pull out my contact lense. This time I definitely did some damage. The pain seared through my whole head and I let out a sharp scream. I quickly picked up my phone and called the ambulance.

I wasn’t wearing any contact lenses. I literally ripped out layers of my eyeball. I’m not getting the vision in my left eye back.",shortscarystories
"I have a certain power.

Every injury I endure, every sickness that I come down with- it effects the planet. I get sick? Somewhere, there’s an outbreak of some kind of disease. Frostbite from playing in the snow too long? Devastating blizzards. You get the idea.

Well around my 7th birthday my mom caught on to this somehow, so she began testing it to be sure. I went without food for 3 days, and famine spread through Asia. From that point on I basically lived in a bubble. She kept me from getting sick, becoming injured... anything that might affect the world negatively. Everything was ok.

When I moved out of the house I was careful, and followed the rules my mother had given me. I was as safe as possible. I guess I wasn’t safe enough.

I was kidnapped around two months ago now, but I’m not exactly sure how long I’ve been here. They think I’m someone else, but they won’t listen. They’ve been torturing me... most of it I can take. I just wish they’d stop burning me. I can’t imagine what’s happening out there.",shortscarystories

"We had first heard of the assimilation through our communicative devices. It started with rural areas; people would come home and they would not be the same person, they became someone new. 


Someone *other.*


We considered it odd. Nothing too sinister. 


This is because the people did nothing but good deeds. They shared their homes with the homeless, they fed the poor and cleaned up the environment. Additionally, it was mostly isolated criminals that had undergone these changes.


And who was going to complain about that? 


Anyone who did became part of the collective before too long. 


Within months, these small communities had become Utopian. Basic needs were free for all and people lived in communal homes, tearing down most neighbourhoods and roads to allow nature to reclaim the land. 


We were *terrified,* we were inspired, we were ignorant to it all. We were overwhelmed. So many differing opinions. 


We waged war against ourselves. **Foolish.** Our concrete cities saw our way of life as an insult, and we struck ourselves down with weapons of mass destruction. 


We should have acted faster. 


What little of us survived were immediately assimilated. 


We **must** assimilate 100% of the population. This, we realised far too late. Providing a modicum of free will allows for far too many deviations, we must not make the same mistakes again.


What few of us remain now traverse the stars in search of continuing our great work. We push, slow and steady into the blackness of space. Currently, we are homing in on several disturbing signals.

"Everyone drew back, bats at the ready, but nothing gruesome came lurching out. Then in the steady glow of their headlamps and electric torches, they saw an iron staircase spiraling towards possibly upper levels.

Curiosity and eagerness to get back to the Surface compelled them to make the ascent, finally emerging through a secret opening in a small cave-like fireplace.

The room they had just entered was vast and every square foot of it was taken up with haphazardly placed piles of antique and vintage clutter and ponderous furniture covered with drop cloths. Although the temperature was uncomfortably chilly, it certainly wasn’t the clammy wet cold of the Underground.

The thick carpet felt grotty and gross beneath their feet, and then there was the smell. Faint at first, but as they walked further into the room, it became a penetrating, eye-watering stench, reminding them of the formaldehyde infused frogs that they had to dissect in biology class.

It was enough to make Luis gag, but he soon steeled himself with the thought that it was probably from some moldy stuffed animal. Taking a confident step forward, he felt something crunch beneath his feet.

Sickened, he stared at the massive tangle of both skeletal and mummified remains. Behind him, he heard exclamations of disgust as the others took notice.

Clasping his nose against the foul, acrid reek, he studied the rats more closely.

Strangely, they all faced one direction, away from the piles of clutter and towards the secret opening. It was like they were fleeing from the something when death eventually caught up with them...and judging from their contorted limbs and knotted together tails, their death wasn’t an easy one.

Gazing towards the center of the room, he wondered if the thing that prompted this mass exodus was still there. Forcing himself forward, he started clambering over the detritus. His friends huddled back, pleading for him to stop, but  Luis carried on. Finally, he reached the center of the room where the smell was nearly unbearable.

Strangely, the center of the room was empty...save for a single chair draped with a dusty, yellowed bed sheet.

Luis froze where he stood, his blood quickly turning to ice water. Peeking out from the bottom of the sheet was a pair of polished shoes with adjustable buckle straps.

He knew those shoes. He had seen them many times strolling down the halls of WrenChester Middle School, sometimes planted firmly in the face of a scared little sixth or seventh-grader.

Carefully, Luis reached out and slowly pulled the sheet off. And what he saw next made him fell backward with shock. Rushing up to his side, the others soon saw what he had revealed.

Despite being missing for three whole months, Tod Winokur didn’t appear to have been dead long. Although the flesh of his cheeks had been somewhat eaten away by rats, revealing some of the teeth inside, the rest of him was surprisingly intact.  Like the rats, his wasn’t a peaceful end.",shortscarystories
"Shadowy figures haunted Bastion for a long time, though none were as constant as the Peeker. Because the house was warmed by a fireplace in the living room, he had to sleep with the door open in the winter unless he would freeze to death. 

He rested his head on his pillow, facing the door as he watched a dark, elongated finger curl over the door from the other side. Three more fingers followed the first. Then, as slow as the moon ascends from the Earth, Bastion could see a bony shoulder, then wild hair stagnant and standing out like the branches of a bush. Lastly, a third of its face poked through, blank, void, empty, and yet Bastion felt it's gaze. 

It made no move to get closer. It merely watched. A witness to Bastion's prone form as his lungs slowly rose and lowered his chest. 

Bastion used to see the Peeker only in the cold nights where he left the door open, but soon after he bought a heater for his bedroom, he would often wake up to the sound of his door creaking open, then watch as still as he could as a dark, elongated finger curled over the door from the other side.",shortscarystories
"I was home alone. On a Saturday at seventeen. Such a situation usually meant mischief or pleasure. But not for me. Not when Sarah didn’t have a license in a small town like Stanwyck, Georgia.

Stuck on the outskirts of the city limits, my parents’ country home was surrounded by woods. A dirt road our only connection to civilization.

I was tall and lean. Maybe too intimidating in both the looks and personality department for people to handle.

With spiked black hair, bright green eyes, and enough make-up to overcome the acne, I guess I was attractive… but still destined for drunken college hook-ups rather than senior prom.

This afternoon was no different. Looking out a window, I scanned our spacious backyard. The cavernous forest. Mom’s garden she used as an escape from dad. And the wooden shed of a mancave dad used as his escape from her.

The sun was out. The January cold held at bay by the light.

A SnapChat notification interrupted my plans. A message from James.

I’d already been flirting with Kati and Steve throughout the day. Yeah, I knew these hotties were strangers, but hey, at least they were *fine*. Not like I was ever gonna meet them.

And James was hot… A tall blonde with big eyes. The type of guy who’d sweet-talk me... And yeah, send me dick, ass, and gym pics with his handsome face in them. Only after I asked, of course. 

I opened his message: *Hey girl ;)*

Flashing a smile, I worked up a quick reply: *Hey there, sexy. How’s Albany?*

I walked outside. Saw James’s response: *Bored. Albany sux*

At the garden, I sent another message: *What are you doing?*

His Bitmoji popped up. Then came the reply: *Nothing send me a pic :p*

Excitement hit me. The first thrill I felt all weekend.

I scanned the yard. In search of the perfect scene.

The photo op was quick. Those filters always came in handy for these improvised sessions.

I took a pic smiling in front of dad’s mancave. The simultaneous sunlight and filters made my eyes sparkle. The sprawling forest and antiquated shed a fairy tale backdrop.

To my delight, James replied even quicker: *Hotttt*

Trembling, I typed a reply: *Your turn*

James’s Bitmoji saw it. Then vanished.

I waited and waited. Kept my eyes glued to the screen.

Finally, I sent another message. *You there?*

Another tense moment crept by. Then James’s Bitmoji reappeared.

My heart skipped a beat. And James took his time…

Then the Snap appeared. I mashed it.

Chills ran down my spine. My rising fire gave way to fear.

There was James in all his creepy beauty. His smile beaming in the sunlight. 

The pic mirrored mine. Especially with dad’s shed lurking behind him. The familiar forest looming in the background. And me immersed in my phone in a corner of the frame… Just like I was now.

"""So this is my stop, I'll see you at school tomorrow?""

""Yeah! If I manage to get any sleep, class is already in... what, 6 hours?""

Sarah chuckled. ""You know, Ben, you should really try and make it to more of these parties from now on. Everybody loved having you there!""

She gave Ben a peck on the cheek and disappeared behind the subway doors just in time for his face to turn bright red.

What a night. Ben had hardly expected his first social outing to go so well. He'd made loads of new friends, not least of which was Sarah, the first girl to ever show an interest in him.

Feeling on top of the world, he took out his brand new bluetooth headphones to keep him company for the rest of the trip home. He'd just bought them the day before. ""They'll work even without a cable!"", the clerk had said. ""The range is about 20 feet, but it should be no problem if you keep your phone nearby."" The sound quality was amazing, and Ben relished the thought of never having to untangle his headphones again.

Closing his eyes, he let the flashbacks from the party wash over him, Sarah's beautiful laugh constantly popped back into his head. He must have been smiling like an idiot, but with the noise cancelling headphones, he was completely insulated from the world around him. Nothing else in the world mattered at that point.

A particularly loud song snapped Ben out of his trance just in time for him to catch his own station. As he walked down the deserted street, he wondered if it was too early to text Sarah.

He snorted at his own thought. Too early? It was almost 4:00 in the morning already. Perhaps just a message to let her know he was home safe. Or, even better, to check if *she* was home safe!

Fuelled by this stroke of genius, Ben reached for his phone and was promptly met with the tiny heart attack that accompanies an empty pocket.

Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. The subway, he must have left his phone on the seat after he started listening to music. Fuuuuck. He didn't know what to do. He *never* lost his things. What did normal people do?

Fuck, he couldn't hear himself think with all this music. He needed to get these damned things off.

As he stared at the bluetooth headphones in his hands, muffled music still emanating from the earpieces, Ben could finally hear himself think.

*Should be no problem if you keep your phone nearby*, the clerk had said.

Ben could finally hear the breathing behind his back.",shortscarystories

"It was a dark night, the moon illuminating little through the clouds that covered it. I hated nights like these, ones that left the mind open to nightmarish beings and other monstrosities. Images of black ghouls reaching for me while I slept was annoying, and kept me up.

Every creak made me jump, every gust of wind warped into a whisper from some beast. I hated feeling like a little kid like this. I was fourteen for god’s sake, I ought to be over this.

The door hinges creaked all of a sudden, a new sound that was out of place in the usual nighttime noises. I looked over, to see someone standing there in the door. They looked like they were made of shadows, with two piercing white eyes. Whoever this was, they were hunched over and distorted. Wings hung at broken angles, hips uneven, and ribs splayed outward painfully. It stared at me, and I saw no emotion in what I could see of its featureless face.

We stared each other down, silently wishing it out of existence. My efforts to relax became futile as it started to walk. Slow, but silent steps crept towards my paralyzed body. It gigantic claws reached for me, just like a nightmare.

“Shhh.” It growled, a noise somewhere between a cat’s screech and a hiss. “sssleep. It will be fine.”

The creature plodded slowly back down the hall, even when I couldn’t see it I heard the steps creak under its weight. I felt scared, but better knowing that it seemed to be leaving my house. What little relaxation I had achieved vanished when an ear-splitting shriek of absolute pain rang in my ears.

I jumped out of my bed, grabbing my phone to call the police. I stopped at the stairs, listening to wet crackling noises and somebody begging for forgiveness or help. It was a combined noise of true human pain, a sound I can never forget in all my heart. I felt sick as blood flowed from somewhere and somebody crawled slowly to the door.

He was broken, bloodied and ripped into as if a bear had chewed through him. His remaining arm strained to carry him away. I stepped back, but the floorboards creaked under my weight. He heard it, looked at me, and mouthed ‘help’ with no air in his lungs.

A black claw sliced into his back and dragged him back as one final screech resounded into the house. I was terrified at the scene, fearing for my life as it was undoubtedly that creature that had killed this man.

My fears were worsened as the creature stepped into view, blood dripping from its chest and claws. In the moment, I noticed its chest was a mouth, bloody fangs instead of ribs adorned its edges. I passed out, too scared for my body to handle.

Each day I rode past she grew a devilish grin.
Over time it turned into a deformed evil frown.

Today when I rode past she wasn't there, which would have been a relief if the front door wasn't open.

After school it looked the same, front door wide open. I rode as fast as I could to my aunt's.

My aunt greeted me the same as always and made me a sandwich.
I asked her ""Is someone moving into my old house?""
She replied seemingly confused ""No dear, not since your mother died"" 

I felt uneasy. just as I was about to head to my room I heard my aunt sigh ""you know, I could've sworn I saw her in your room earlier, I miss her so much"" 

My blood ran cold at the sight of my bedroom door opening",shortscarystories
"Everytime I sleep I rouse in the middle of the night, the man whispers and strokes my hand.
He tells me that I'm welcome with him, that I'm his. 
He tells me how much he knows about my situation.
How much he sympathises with me. When I open my eyes he disappears, and I look under the bed in the morning, paranoia leaves me when I realise nothing's there.
But every night it gets more intense, with him being inches away from my face. His blind, hazy blue eyes almost looking at me. But I can never see him for more than a second. Last night, I didn't wake to him. But I awoke to my toddler brothers screams.",shortscarystories
"  

Late November, Grandma died. Suffered a stroke in bed. Woke up. Fell down the stairs wearing her dressing-gown. Kissed the body goodbye and the cheek was cold. The still, toothless mouth slacked agape, eyelids closed and hair thin, grey and dry as bone. Wasn’t grandma. Mother cried. Next day went to work. Colleagues said they were sorry and told me of their dead Grandma’s. 

Funeral came mid-December. Everyone sad. The clouds were grey and low in the morning, but the sun came out before the service. Everyone said that was Grandma. Walked behind coffin to ‘Look for me in Rainbows’

*Time for me to leave you*  
 *I won't say goodbye*  
 *Look for me in rainbows*  
 *High up in the sky*  
   
 Wondered how many times this had played at a funeral. Wondered who chose this song.

*In the evening sunset*  
 *When all the world is through*  
 *Just look for me and love me*  
 *And I’ll be close to you*

Cousin delivered a poem to commemorate her life. Was good. Made people cry. Said goodbye to the body in the coffin. 

*It won't be forever*  
 *The day will come and then*  
 *My loving arms will hold you*  
 *When we meet again*

People shook my hand and offered their condolences leaving the crematorium. Everyone said it was good she didn’t suffer; she was at peace now. Saw Great-Aunt. She’s in a wheelchair now and doesn’t remember who I am. Went round back for a smoke. Saw the sun fall behind the sky burning orange and purple. I heard the extractor fans working. 

Didn’t dream that night. Went to work the next morning. People were busy. Came home. Made dinner. Masturbated. Went to sleep.

Slowly I awoke and I’m smaller and it’s Christmas time and grandma is in the corner and she’s smiling drinking tea like I remember she’s happy but the cousin is holding papers and it’s an evening sunset outside the sky is orange and burnt purple and the pale white ball begins to hurt my eyes I’m looking at it too long burning a toothless hole then Mother’s in the corner and she’s smiling drinking tea but the cousin delivers the poem and suddenly the mother starts crying she’s in a wheelchair now the cousins and aunts gather round and say they’re sorry and tell her of their dead grandma and there’s a crash down the stairs it’s the body the pale white body with the still, toothless mouth, hair thin, grey and dry as bone arms will hold you again.  The eyes open and she smiles.

I wake up. My eyes fix on a shadow by the doorway. Just a dressing gown. Just a dream. But terror coursed through me as I imagined what felt like fingernails sliding around my waist, a cold arm holding me, a body in my bed, pressing itself against my naked flesh, turning around to see a pale face staring back. 

But there was nothing there. I pissed myself. So I laughed.",shortscarystories
"I've come to visit you. I'm going to tell you my story.

My real name isn't Mrs Judy, I just use that name as I'm bored of my real one. My real name is Pulcinella. Perhaps you've heard of me? I come from the *Commedia dell'arte*. The *Commedia* was a type of theatre invented in the 16th century. The ""comedy of craft"".

I come specifically from Naples, where my character rose to fame. I had many friends, in the old days. Arlecchino, Pantalone, Pierrot. Perhaps you've heard of them too? I ate them.

My character evolved into many different forms - Punch of Punch and Judy, several trickster puppets - and my friends, the zanni, evolved into what you now know as clowns.

I was sick of being the puppet, sick of my idiot friends and their tiresome ways. That's one of the reasons I ate them.

I ate Harlequin, Pierrot and his idiot mate Pierrette, and all the sad clowns and mimes of the world. The ones you see now are mere shadows of what they once were.

I changed my voice. I hated speaking in that high pitched way. I hated my wife, I hated the Policeman, and most of all I hated that crocodile. They were all my children, and I hated them. So I ate them up, soul and all. That's the way to do it.

I hear that we clowns are making a comeback. You might have seen some where you live.

I know all about them.

Most of them are human. Idiot humans trying to scare children. Jumping on the bandwagon, you might say.

But some of them aren't human. Some of them are me. Bits of myself that I sent out into the world to finish the work I started so long ago.

So if you see one of them, if you see a clown in your local park, or the corner of your street, be very careful. It might be me. I might have come to eat you.",shortscarystories
"Attics are always treasure troves. The older the family, the better. 

Which is why I loved going through my grandparent's attic. 

Every Saturday, my grandma would set out cookies and milk for me before sitting down on her old sofa and knitting. Like usual, my grandpa sat on the porch out front. 

I'd eat the cookies in front of the TV hurriedly before rushing upstairs and pulling the small rope which opened the panel with its ladder  leading to the attic. It was always dusty and hard to breathe up there, but it was worth it just to look through all the stuff my grandparents hoarded over the decades. 

There was an old typewriter, some clocks, newspapers, and, of course, plenty of boxes. I knew almost everything that was in there. 

So when I found a small box on top of an old dresser sitting in the attic, I was ecstatic. I never saw it before! I reached up and grabbed it, pulling it down. It was surprisingly light. I glanced it over. It looked new, as if it had just been put there. What caught my eye the most was the lock on the box; nothing else in the attic was locked. 

I set the box down, looking at it. Under my gaze, a spider squeezed its way from under the shut lid and scuttled away through the dust.

With a shudder, I went to put the box back on top of the dresser. This wasn't any of my business.

While reaching, I tripped on an old phone book and the box fell onto the floor. The lock cracked open. A few spiders tumbled from the open box, dislodged from their home.

Hearing the crash, my grandma called to me from downstairs. ""Are you ok, sweetie?"" I heard her start walking up the stairs to check on me.

I looked at the box. There, folded neatly, were the wrinkled, deflated skins of my grandparents. 

My mouth was dry. The footsteps of my grandma were getting closer.",shortscarystories

"Most pet owners let their kittens have free roam of their homes, but after my last one... My last kitty got out and got hit by a car. Poor thing.

My favorite part of the day is watching tv with her sitting in my lap, absent mindedly stroking her.

I love to watch her lapping up her milk while I drink my morning coffee. I feed her raw meat in a golden bowl. Only the best for my little feline.

When I leave for work, she goes into her crate where it's safe. There's plenty of room for her bed, her litter box and lots of little toys to keep her busy while I'm gone.

She keeps begging me to let her go. I keep telling her she's supposed to meow like a good little kitty. She struggles against the chains that keep her safe in her crate. I warn her that if she escapes, I'll run her down with my car.. just like the last one.",shortscarystories
"I didn’t become a cop because I’m selfless, not entirely. I love my job, the rush of endorphins I get from doing good and being appreciated is a junkies wet dream, but I’ve always had a hidden agenda. You see I’m not a very attractive man. It’s ironic that a derogatory term for my position is ‘pig’ because that’s an insult I’ve heard most of my life. My love life has been non existent outside of lubricant and my wingman google search, but being a cop at least gave me more hope to find a partner. Women love a man in uniform right? 

My career choice seemingly paid off when I saw her. I was pulling cross walk duty when I met this gorgeous woman and her adorable daughter Emily. She was a single mom looking for some stability and I was a single man looking for a soulmate. We exchanged numbers and things took off. A few dinners and movie nights later, we had become so inseparable that I began to stay at her place.

I really embraced the quasi father role that was thrust upon me. I saw her daughter as my own and wanted to provide a great future for them, really complete the family I could only ever dream of. So I began taking on more nurturing roles. I learned how to cook, I constantly cleaned and I would always help with homework. 

Before long it was me who took on the bulk of parental responsibilities. For the first time in years my girlfriend was able to relax and enjoy a life she hadn’t known since before Emily’s arrival. I sold my house that had been left to me by my parents and moved in with my new makeshift family. 

It was an adjustment for sure. I had to lecture my girlfriend a few times about fiscal responsibility, but I could understand wanting to live a little after years of just scraping by. I was just happy to feel needed outside of my profession. Unfortunately, the happiness would be short lived.

I had just approached the office when the call came in. “All units to 7 West Elm, reported stabbing, possible fatality.” 7 West Elm? My house? Stabbing!? I flicked on the cherries and arrived to the house in record time. My heart sank as I saw paramedics wheeling out the lifeless remains of little Emily. I was inconsolable and frantic for answers. I spotted my girlfriend, but before I could wrap my arms around her, it happened.

She jumped behind another officer and shrieked like a cat in heat, shaking and waving a finger towards me. “It was him! He did this to my daughter! He told me the badge would protect him.” Before I could speak, the officer cuffed and led me away. 

I looked over my shoulder with tears in my eyes to glance at my girlfriend. She had the biggest smile I’d seen in the entire time we dated.",shortscarystories
"Eli Freyer pushes his cart with the one stray wheel. Little black streaks trailing behind in his wake. A more sensible person would have swapped it for a better one. 

All of Eli’s endeavors are hapless.

Down the aisle and atop a ladder, a young man sporting a maroon Simply Save vest finishes a large display of pickled goods. He cringes as Eli attempts to squeak past.

The wheel skips a beat. Eli swerves hard left, careening into the base. Unbalanced, the employee topples from his perch, bracing the fall to his haunches with the flats of his hands. A cascade of distilled vinegar and splintered glass crashes to the tile around him.

Faltering, Eli reaches out to grasp the boy’s shoulder, “OH, GOD! ARE YOU OK?” 
 
“Stop. Just—don’t touch anything, man,” the boy says, up righting himself. He checks a small gash on his right forearm. Finds relief that he is otherwise unharmed.

“I am so, SO sorry,” says Eli.

“It’s fine. I’m alright. Shit. I better get cleaned up. Gotta sweep and mop all this now.”

“Well, I’m glad you’re alright, hope the rest of your day goes better.”

“Yeah, thanks. Same to you. Have a good one,” says the boy, looking back from over his shoulder. 

As he does so, he notices the man staring after him through the folds of his slate grey field jacket, hood up, faux-disarming eyes of a leopard seal peering out. And behind those…something—not vacant, but writhing and primordial—sets the boy’s skin to formication. 

All of Eli’s endeavors are carried out with deliberate intent.

Eli continues to peruse the store after, looking for the thing that he needs: anything to displace the quiet in his head, arouse the susurrate voice which speaks only to him from its sleep.

As he wanders, he stops occasionally, and using the multi-tool he carries in his breast pocket, undoes fastenings from high shelves containing heavy or jagged objects. 

Finished, he leaves his cart in the self-checkout lane. He couldn’t find what he came searching for.

“That’s ok,” he thinks walking to his car, “It’s early yet. Full day ahead still. I can short out the crosswalk near West Aberdeen and Main. Visit that tweaker’s house on Avenue D. The one that looks like the scarecrow from Wizard of Oz got a brain lacking in impulse control. He has OCD. I can break in. Rearrange all his shit. Then I’ll call the Thompson family out near the race track for the forty-fourth or… no, forty-seventh time this week. Tell em’ I’m still watching their house. Maybe while breathing heavy and sometimes weeping. 

See, for Eli, to maim or to wound—physically or psychologically— is to inflict consequences farther reaching and longer lasting than any death process. Scars stay. Grow with you. Can spread even.

And then the voice will come back. Mercifully so. Because Eli is very tired of listening to sound of his own blood.",shortscarystories
" There are many ways our world could end;

**Nuclear War:**

Did you know that hundreds, If not thousands, of nuclear weapons are ready to be released within minutes...that's a troubling fact considering that the *biggest* threat of nuclear war may be by accident or miscommunication.


**Biological warfare:**

Unlike nuclear weapons, which require complex engineering, biological and chemical warfare can be developed at a relatively low cost and with relatively attainable materials.

Weaponized toxic chemicals could do tremendous harm, say, if the toxins were released into the air or into the water supply...

**Catastrophic climate change:**

A United Nations panel of scientists released a statement saying that we only have 12 years to keep global warming to a moderate level.

Their projections of the effects of climate change varied depending on how much the Earth warms (usually modeled on an increase of *just* 1 to 3 degrees Celsius)...And none of the scenarios look good.

**Pandemics:**

Twice in modern history, plagues have swept across the world, killing an estimated 15 percent of the population in a few decades.
Luckily, deadly diseases with the capacity to spread globally are rare. But they do happen — a century ago, the Spanish flu killed more than 50 million people...Remember the outbreaks of SARS and Ebola in recent years?...

**Asteroid impact:**

Asteroids are rocks that revolve around the sun and that occasionally collide with the Earth. An asteroid large enough to cause a global catastrophe hits Earth every 120,000 years, scientists estimate. It’s likely what killed the dinosaurs, and if an asteroid even one-tenth the size of the one that caused their extinction hit Earth today, the results would be devastating.


It's all plausible...it's all very possible...

But, of course, non of us *really* think this is how we will die, and to be honest, is all of us dying at the same time really all that scary?...

Personally, I'd rather die as a mass than die alone and scared.

Statistically speaking, *your* end could come from choking on that piece of food you're eating...or get flattened by that car that's passing you. Maybe you're on a bus or a train that collides with another...or perhaps you're just walking back from the kitchen because you forgot your knife and fork, only to trip and fall and stab yourself in the eye and through to the brain...

It's these things that scare me, and this is how I *don't* want to die.

So for me, I say, bring on the end of the world, because dying together is clearly better than dying alone.",shortscarystories
"Dear Mr. and Mrs.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I am Jacob Philidor. I am told by the nuns here that you are interested in becoming my adoptive parents. Because of this I have stolen your contact details from the mother superior’s desk and I am writing to plead with you not to inquire about my case further. For everyone’s sake, for the sake of Christ himself, I beg you to leave me in my room at the orphanage until my childhood is over.

For you to understand what I am telling you it is important first that you understand The Fisherman:

For as long as I can remember he— The Fisherman— has been part of my life. When I was a baby he would stand motionlessly above the head of my crib. His yellow, sea-rotten eyes were to me the twisting objects in a mobile. My birthparents never seen him. They would lay feet away making love and my eyes would move from them to him— to the parasitic crustaceans living inside his face. 

If you think it’s odd that I can remember this you should be advised I am an extremely gifted and unusual child. But then you know that from my files, don’t you? In reality, I remember everything. I remember being pushed through my mother’s bones into the world. 

As I grew The Fisherman grew closer. 

When I was two years old he would lay in bed with me in the long, hot nights. I can still smell his salty breath as he taught me the words of his profession: *rod, reel, line, net, bait.*  

He would tell me to scream some nights and when I did and one or the other of my parents appeared to soothe me he would lie there as silent as a corpse. 

Only after they were gone would he speak to me again: 

“Good, Jacob,” he whispered. “Good.” 

One night, when I was three, he swiped at me with his hand. His fingers were made of hooks. One sharp barb split the skin under my right eye. I carry the scar even now. 

I screamed louder than I ever had. 

My father burst into the room holding a baseball bat. He saw my blood and began to swing at the shadows. 

I could see what was happening even if he couldn’t. The ceiling and walls became insubstantial. The stone and plaster became gelatinous ropes that fell down around us. The ropes coiled around my father’s neck and his spine snapped as he was hoisted up and disappeared into the blackness above. 

“Rod, reel, line,” The Fisherman said. 

As the baseball bat hit the floor the light went on. My mother tried to step through the doorway. She became entangled in a sheet of slime. 

“Net,” The Fisherman smiled as my mother was absorbed into nothingness. 

In the silence I looked across the room to my own, small, bleeding image in the mirror at the foot of the bed. 

“Bait,” said The Fisherman.",shortscarystories
"You know sometimes you wake up in the middle of the night and feel like someone's watching you.

You look around the room, turn the lights on to make you feel better, roll over and go back to sleep. 

Well three nights ago this happened to me and and I didn't even have to turn on the lights. I woke up in a panic for no apparent reason. But as I looked around my room my eyes fell to the foot of the bed. 

And there it was. 

Only its face was visible above my bed. 

Eyes glowing faintly green with huge black slits for pupils. 
Its skin looked horribly stretched around its face, so much so that there were visible lacerations, some with macabre, awkward stitches across them, some open with a dark liquid oozing out.
Bright, pointed teeth gleamed in a grin from behind thin pitch black lips. 

I was frozen in fear. I couldn't move.

Even as it's spindly fingers with pointed sharp nails began climbing ever so slowly on top of the mattress.

Even as it started pulling it's hideously deformed body onto my sheets, limbs pointing in ungodly directions.

Even as it crawled up behind me and layed down, arms curling around my body.

I couldn't move. 

It's raspy breath, stinking of death, assaulting my ears and nose.

I layed there. Absolutely still. Terrified to move a muscle.

Eventually the sun came up. My mom never called my name through my door as she often did when I overslept. In fact, no sound at all could be heard throughout the entire house. No birds calling from outside my window. Just the steady, slow inhale and exhale from the creature. 

As I said, this happened three nights ago and I've been lying here with it since.

I just got up the courage to grab my phone which I always keep beside me as I sleep. I'm typing this, though I'm petrified to move any further. I don't know what will happen if I do and I'm too scared to find out.

Somebody. Please help me.",shortscarystories

Another shot cut through the silence.

"She was my beautiful little girl, my only child, but in death she looked inhuman. Although limbs and flesh were missing, the cause of death was actually brain damage from excessive thrashing. My friends and family constantly console me and comfort me about the incident, insisting that it’s not my fault the dog snapped. 

They tell me how noble I was to take Zoey in to begin with. An abused Pit Bull, she was used as practice bait in an underground dogfighting ring. Poor thing bore the scars of many one sided sparring matches and was always in a fragile state, cowering at loud noises or neighborhood dog barks even after 5 years. Prior to the birth of my child people had told me to get rid of her due to the breeds reputation and her background. But I always defended her, she was a good girl. Now she would join my daughter in death as animal control would soon euthanize. 

It was terrible having to sit with police and give a recap of the events, going into gruesome detail about my little girl’s final moments without leaving out a thing. I told them how my husband had been away on a work trip, I was doing a load of laundry and foolishly left my 2 year old upstairs alone with the dog. Zoey was a coward and had never acted aggressively in the years we’ve had her, I never thought she could be capable of such a thing. When I heard the commotion I ran upstairs and saw a scene straight out of a horror flick. My baby’s face was gone. Her clothes tattered to pieces, chunks of flesh missing and presumably eaten by this beast.

I recounted grabbing a broom and frantically hitting Zoey repeatedly as she continued to swing my baby around like a rag doll. Although i’m small in stature, I hit that dog with all my might and the bruises to Zoey’s head and back attest to how hard I fought for my daughter’s life. I could even see the cops becoming unnerved and pale with every heart wrenching detail.

Time has passed and i’ve moved forward with my life. But still, people tell me how sorry they are for me, how it must be so hard to live after witnessing such a terrible thing. 

I kind of chuckle a little in my head when they say this. The real hard part was getting Zoey to cover up my crime. Even after a week of starvation, I still had to beat that bitch repeatedly until she finally started taking bites. But then again, Zoey really was a good dog.",shortscarystories
"Vicky hated going to the dentist. It always seemed to hurt.

Her small frame sat in the dentist’s chair, the hygienist adjusting the light for clear view in her tiny mouth.

Vicky’s parents stood outside the exam room talking to the dentist, periodically looking to her.

“Oh no… It’s gonna hurt again I know it…” she said to the hygienist starting to tear up.

“He can give you gas so you won’t feel a thing!” the hygienist replied trying to keep a smile. “Now open up so I can take another look!”

Vicky opened, then quickly closed making a chomping sound giggling “Scared you didn’t I!” Her small face beamed with self-amusement.

The dentist returned leaving her parents to continue their conversation; their body language indicating a heated exchange.

“Every time they fight, it’s me who ends up getting hurt…” Vicky’s scared little eyes looking to the dentist for help.

The dentist and hygienist exchanged worried glances; appearing extremely uncomfortable in this situation. The dentist picked up a pliers-like tool from the tray.

“No…. you said it wasn’t going to hurt!” Vicky sobbing “Why did you lie?”

The dentist spun beckoning with his head for assistance from the parents.

Vicky’s mother ran in and kneeled beside her, steadying her in the chair. “It’s going to be okay! It’ll be over in a flash!”

Her father entered appearing still angry, his fists clenched; his part of the conversation unfinished.

“All I’m saying is…” his voice trailing off as he noticed the dentist’s tools. They were arranged in the tray with OCD like precision, twenty-three sparkling razor-sharp stainless-steel instruments just within his reach now; his fingers individually tapping on his leg as if considering.

Returning his stare to his wife “All I’m saying is that it would have been nice if you’d asked me first… I mean did the thought of her mental capacity ever cross your mind?”

The mother now glowered up at him with a look that implied he was on thin ice.

“No… you wanted a baby… Just look at her!” Everyone in the room now shooting him a glance.

“What’s wrong with me daddy?” Vicky asked with new tears starting in her eyes.

“Awe… nothing is wrong with you sweetie! It’s not your fault...” His face eerily switching from anger to soft compassion and back in a well-practiced manner. “It’s your mother…”

The mother quickly stood eye to eye with the father.

“Do you want to do this here?” she asked snarling...

Vicky sat frozen in fear.

The dentist and hygienist shrinking down, using the distraction to sneak away.

“All I’m saying is that you should have considered her physical and mental state when you bit her… Every year we have to have her fangs ripped out because she doesn’t understand what her bites do…”

His speech interrupted as he suddenly noticed the missing staff, his angry expression turned to frustration.

His body quickly transformed, his ears and fangs growing as he sprinted to retrieve them.",shortscarystories
"
 I currently live with my mom and dad in a big house. They work night shifts and I have the house myself.
 I used to love being alone in the house but that all changed one night.
 My dad gave me money to order pizza.
 So I did. My mom left forty minutes after.
 I was home alone. After eating junk food and pizza all night. At 2a.m I hear something new.
 A banging noise downstairs but it was faint.
 I had balls to investigate it. So I did just that. 
I checked the second floor. Clear. 
I checked the first floor. Clear. 
I found that the noise was getting relatively closer. 
So my attention turned to the basement door.
 I had to investigate. 
Our basement light does not work so I had to use my flashlight. 
I went down the steps. 
The noise was echoed now.
 I shined my light when I got to the bottom step. My heart sank into my stomach. 
Blood everywhere. And I mean everywhere on the floor like someone had been stabbed.
 Except, the blood was black. 
The noise lead me to the back basement room. I shined my light in the room I saw it. 
It was banging on the wall creating an abnormal noise. It was tall and skinny.
 It turned to face me, I was terrified.
The things face was messed up. 
The mouth was on it's forehead.
 The eye on it's cheek. 
The nose on it's chin. 
The things mouth stretched to the floor.
 I was frozen. 
I stood there as the thing let out a demonic screech. It ran toward and grabbed me. I passed out. 
My parents woke me. I was on the basement floor. 
They were worried. 
I looked and saw no sign of blood or the thing. I told my parents. They said it was a nightmare. It wasn't. I felt the thing grab me. Whenever my parents went to work.
 I locked myself in the room until they got back. The second encounter was a month later. I was watching my favorite movie Back to the Future. Until, all of the power cut out. 
I was scraed as hell when this happened. I heard footsteps. It wasn't my parents. I heard a new noise now. 
Groaning, not like a person's groan. I hid under my bed. I was actually in a good spot.
 I hid for about three minutes until something stopped outside my doorway. I saw my door open. 
How is that possible?! I locked it! I saw that gut wrenching thing you call a face peek in the doorway. 
The thing started to look around. It stepped in and was about 8 feet tall. It was leaking black blood. That was from the basement. It was walking out but then it turned. The mouth stretched to the floor once again when it looked in my direction.
 The thing got on its knees and crawled on its knees toward me.  The mouth bunched up I don't know why I remember this. The thing pulled me out and towered over me. I screamed.
 But when I did, I heard pairs of footsteps coming up to my room. The thing was about to take a bite out of me with its big mouth. The light turned on as the thing vanished before my eyes. 
My parents were near the doorway. Worried sick. The thing was gone. My parents did not see what I was talking about. Apparently I have been hiding from it for five hours! How is that possible?! I remember hearing the noise at 3.a.m I am writing this at my desk because I need help. If I call the police, they won't believe me. I don't know what to do again, tonight.",shortscarystories
"She smiled at me in the Starbucks.

I thought she was smiling at somebody behind me, but her honey-coloured eyes gazed directly into mine.

I’ve always been shy with girls. I was 26 and had never had a girlfriend or even a kiss. I didn’t dare approach her.

So she came to me.

With a confident smile, she told me she was called Mavis and she was not from here.

I mumbled hello, welcome.

Her smile grew even warmer.

I was so nervous. All I’d ever done with a girl had been holding hands, and that only once, back in college with Tara. I still remembered her cool skin pressed against mine.

But as I spoke to Mavis I understood that she was a perfect match.

We talked until the Starbucks closed. Later we sat on a bench in the nearby park and she pointed at the stars.

*There*, she said. *Do you think on that distant star, there are two creatures like us, wondering if they’re all alone?*

*I don’t feel alone*, I said. *Not any more.*

I gathered all my courage and said I wanted to see her again. She said yes. She didn’t have a phone, but would meet me in two days here in the park, exactly at midnight.

She kissed my lips when she left.

For two days I floated on a cloud, filled with the glow of promised love. I loved her already. Would this be it, at last? Would I finally be allowed the wonderful feeling I had heard about in books and movies?

But then — maybe she would change her mind. Or maybe it was a cruel joke, like it had been with Tara.

Yet there I was two days later, wearing a nice shirt and eau de cologne I’d just bought.

Midnight came and went. Had she forgotten? But then –

*Darling*.

Her outline stood in the gloomy park. I hadn’t realised she was so tall. Yet she was slim and feminine. Her curves were almost too gorgeous to be real.

*Darling, I’ve missed you*.

*What happened to your voice*, I asked. *Why is it so deep?*

*Don’t worry, my dear*.

I could not see her face in the dark, or her warm smile.

*Come, darling, my love, come*.

She took my hand. Her skin felt just like Tara’s.

It’s too good, I warned myself, but by then she had already pulled me with her.

She told me she loved me later, when we lay by the side of the brook, hidden by the dry shrubs and guarded by the ancient cypresses and she dug her talons into my flesh. She hummed it in her inhuman voice as she ripped my neck open with her long, curved fangs. She sang it into my ears as my blood sprayed over what was now her insect body and she stared at me out of countless dull spider eyes.

I love you, I love you, I love you. You are my first love.",shortscarystories
"I'm sitting at my desk right now, absentmindedly scratching at the zit(?) on the upper part of my chest, below my collarbone. I think it's a zit, but there's no head or anything inside of it, it's just a red spot, too small for a bug bite, and anyway, that wouldn't make sense since it's winter in Alaska currently. The patch of red around it keeps growing though, and I think I scratched too hard, because it looks like I might be bleeding under the skin, it's like a bruise, but darker.

It's cold here, of course. But I've always loved the ocean, and I wanted to go swimming, but it's too cold in the winter. For most, it's too cold in the summer too, but I always swim in the ocean and lakes and rivers here in the summer. There's this one lake, it's strange, because it always gets so hot in the summer that you can't swim in it because of the anaerobic bacteria and brain eating amoebas. It's an anomaly, none of the other bodies of water in Alaska come even close to being too warm to swim in. I have never considered swimming in the strange lake in the winter. 

So last night I did. I just wanted to swim outside, not in a hot tub or pool. It makes me feel so connected to nature. The water was cold, but not freezing. I don't know why this lake is warmer. Anyway, I didn't catch a bacterium or naegleria or anything. But something else... Seems to be happening. The skin has ripped off the spot on my chest, and there's something green underneath. It's on my hands now too. I don't think I can type much longer, my hands feel so fat and fluffy, it's like they're growing moss, but it's slimy. 

My coworker Paul has a service dog. I like that dog, his name is Bettany. But today he looks... Good. Like he would taste good. Paul is blind. He wouldn't notice, would he? I mean he would eventually. But not right away... 

The slimy moss is on my stomach now. It's taking over my tattoos. I can smell Bettany. I wonder if I could just chop off one leg... Stitch him back up. They eat dogs in Korea right? So this isn't that weird. Maybe Paul wouldn't even have to know. I'd better go try that while I can still use my hands. And I have to get out of here, back to the lake. Someone is going to notice that I look different, and I'm so tired, I just want to relax in that nice water... But I need to grab a snack first.",shortscarystories
"""Carmen, Rio, time for bed!"" Their mother called this to them every night. Every night, Carmen would head into her room to sleep after getting ready and every night her brother Rio would hide somewhere in her room to come out and scare her before running back into his room. Carmen searched for him several times, but he was so small that he was able to fit into practically anywhere. After a while, she no longer flinched at her brother's antics. Even as she confronted him during the day, he would deny it, and her mother did nothing but scold him gently.

There were times when Carmen wished to get back at her brother, and at last she was given the opportunity. Rio got invited to a sleepover with some friends so Carmen had the night to herself in order to set some traps. She threw stones into his bed. She rigged a water balloon to pop over his head when he opened his door. Carmen's favorite touch was the monster in his closet made up of clothes, wire and a coat rack.

""Time for bed Carmen!"" Her mother called from downstairs. Satisfied with her work, Carmen got ready and headed into her bedroom. She was eager to be able to go to sleep without having her annoying brother try to scare her for once.

As soon as her head hit the pillow, a figure jumped up in front of her vision from under the bed. ""Boo!"" Her brother shouted.

Carmen pushed back and nearly fell off of the bed. ""Rio?!"" She exclaimed. ""How long were you under there? You're supposed to be at your friend's house!""

Rio looked confused for a moment. Then his eyes turned downcast. Then he smiled. ""Oh well,"" He sighed in a voice that was not his. Carmen became paralyzed as she witnessed his face and body writhe and distort from Rio to a dark, lanky figure with a smile too wide and teeth too sharp. ""It was fun while it lasted.""

Carmen's mother was used to her screaming before bed. As the cries became louder, her mother turned up the volume on the T.V.",shortscarystories
"It started slow, as addictions usually do. I'd always been adventurous, looking for the next thrill, willing to try anything to feel alive. I tried many things, but it wasn't enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I found a man who always stood in the shadows who had something that could sort me out, he said, 'this is the fix you've been looking for'. And he was right. I was obsessed.

&amp;#x200B;

In the day, I went to work, I painted a cheerful facade and said all the right things. Pretended to care. Pretended to be normal. But beneath the surface all I could do was think about getting my next fix. And at night I would feel the thrill, almost as intense as the first time. I spent years living a vaguely normal life.

&amp;#x200B;

But it wasn't enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Soon, the small amounts I could afford to pay for weren't enough to satiate my cravings and one day the shadowy man wasn't at our meeting point. I called in sick to work and obsessively looked for him. Then, when I could take it no longer, I turned to other methods. I used the last of my money buying on the dark web. It was a large amount, I hoped it would be enough.

I was fired for not turning up at my job too many times. I'll be honest, when I was there I didn't do a good job. It had been a while since I had stopped bothering, stopped caring about anything, including personal hygiene. I couldn't remember the last time I showered. My teeth were decaying. My limbs were stringy, malnourished, and my bones jutted hideously. Nobody wanted someone like me looking after their child.

&amp;#x200B;

But I was happy. I had my fix and for a while, it lasted.

&amp;#x200B;

But it wasn't enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I turned to stealing. From friends and family at first, those I was close to. People who wouldn't have suspected. I hated who I was becoming, but every time I got my fix all my worries blissfully dissolved and I felt that rush. I needn't have worried about getting caught. We lived in an area where crime was rife. Burglaries were common, people didn't walk alone, and neighbours knew better than to be friendly with each other. No-one noticed.

&amp;#x200B;

But it wasn't enough.

&amp;#x200B;

And now, here I was with something so precious, so beautiful and pure, and LOVED. People were bound to notice it missing.

I cried, begged, howled, and prayed to any and all gods to rid me of this curse; to forgive me my sins, to transform me from this disgusting, addicted animal. I wished I had another option. But the nagging gnawing persisted.

&amp;#x200B;

I stroked her soft flaxen hair, and whispered reassurances to her sweet, scared, innocent face.

And it was over before she knew it. I made sure of that. I haven't lost all humanity yet.

But I knew it wouldn't be enough.

"I sat alone in a room, one source of light but nothing else. Their was a black void surrounding me. Voices came from it, voices that said to me ""You left them their to burn, to rot you left them in the blazing flames Josh. Why, they were only children."" or ""You were supposed to watch over the orphanage, but instead you thought driving away was a better idea."" ""I DIDN'T MEAN IT!""

"When I first heard the story about how Native Americans used to fear cameras, it tickled me. The basic gist of it, as I recall, was that they thought the camera would *steal* their soul.

I occasionally wondered what they thought happened. Like, do you drop dead the moment the shutter clicks? Or maybe you keep on living but your body is an empty shell, taken over by something else?

I never bothered looking into the history of it. It's one of those funny little facts you bring up to try and look clever or whatever. Unless you're into myths and such, it's not something you'd ever really look into.

Obviously, with our scientific minds, we can laugh it off as ignorant superstitions, right?

Wrong.

The thing is, it's not *stealing* your soul.

It's *copying* it.

Every time you take a picture, it's another copy of you - your consciousness - trapped in that moment, forever.

The world behind me is completely still. The beach, all those people tanning and playing and swimming. My little sister, unmoving, caught just as she threw the ball at me. I wonder how far it goes. Light travels a long way, you know.

In front of me, everything that wasn't caught in the camera's view is gone, replaced by the world beyond the picture. I'm glad this photo was good enough to go on the wall. I don't think I'd want to be in a photo album.

And what happens with all those photos my sister - she's older than me now! - keeps taking of herself on her phone? Do they see out of the phone? Does that copy of herself see what the people she sends the pictures to are doing? Is the soul copied when the picture is copied? I know what I used to do when I looked at some girl's pictures... Pictures I found on the internet.

Or is it just darkness.

I wonder what the people behind me think, stuck in a picture taken by a stranger, staring into their home.

I'm lucky, I suppose, because I'd already eaten, gone to the toilet, and was wide awake when this picture was taken. Nothing changes inside the frame. No hunger or thirst. No need to sleep. Just the sun on my back, the breath of fresh air that I'd just inhaled, and a good view of the world. I'm the me I was for as long as this picture exists.

I feel bad for the versions of me trapped inside the photos my parents took of me as a baby.",shortscarystories
" Instruction Manual:

Preparations:

\-Make sure to clean up any organic materials left on the music box.

\-Make sure there are no other people in a 30 meter radius around you or the music box might fail.

\-The music box might not work properly if your remaining life span is not long enough, if this is the case the music box is not suitable for you.

\-Make sure the room is entirely dark or it, you won’t be able to call up any spirits.

\-This ritual can only work if the person you're trying to summon is dead.

&amp;#x200B;

Steps:

1. Wind up the music box and keep winding it up for an entire hour.

&amp;#x200B;

2. When the hour has passed release the music box and let it play for a full minute.

&amp;#x200B;

3. When the music has stopped start saying the Latin chant below:

*Tolle animam meam in commutationem* 

Don’t worry about the procounations as this chant is based on intent.

3.5. Keep thinking about the dead person you’re trying to summon. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. If all the previous steps were done correctly the music should change to a low screaming/roaring. It's important to note that this screaming is artificial and meant to lure in spirits.

&amp;#x200B;

5. At this point spirits will appear in your room, some of them might be hostile while most of them won’t be. It's important that you don’t listen to them and their lies. They will try to stop the music box but as long as you don’t give in to their demands the ritual will continue as normal.

&amp;#x200B;

6. Once the person you’re looking appears you can ask the things you want.

Keep in mind that you are not allowed to ask about:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Your own future

\-The After Life

\-The Wishing Demon

&amp;#x200B;

If you do ask about one of those three things the summoned spirit will always lie.

&amp;#x200B;

7. Once you’re done with the music box there’s no need to put it away, soon you will feel very tired. 

This is completely normal.

&amp;#x200B;

Is the conversation with the dead not good enough? We give you your money back!

"  

A slight shift beside me in the bed tore me from sleep. It was too dark to see and I was too groggy to open my eyes, so my question—not that I even knew exactly what I was asking—came out more like a groan that rose in pitch at the end. 

My husband seemed to understand what I meant. I could hear the smile in his voice as he quietly responded: “Just going to the bathroom, babe.”

Murmuring a sleepy hum of acknowledgement, I snuggled deeper into my pillow. The memory foam melded perfectly to my face. I was still sleepy enough to fall asleep without my big spoon, but if I stayed awake for too long, insomnia would kick in without his arms around me. 

For a moment, the only sounds were my own breathing and his footfall on carpet. Harsh light shone into the room for just a moment as he turned on the hall light, but he was considerate enough to quickly close the door to help me rest. 

A few minutes passed, and I was still awake. I let out a harsh breath through my nose as I turned onto my left side, then back onto my right. Soon enough, the bedroom door opened and closed again. 

A small smile crossed my face as my husband walked back towards the bed. I opened my eyes just a crack, warmth filling me at the sight of his familiar outline, however obscured by darkness it was. He gingerly slipped into bed beside me and we fit together like puzzle pieces. His blissful warmth, the grounding weight of his arm over my waist, the steady rhythm of his breathing, the soft kiss he pressed onto the back of my neck… it all helped slumber wash over me like a warm bath. 

And it made me all the more surprised to hear a knock at the bedroom door. 

“Babe? Why’s the door locked?”

The arms around me tightened.",shortscarystories
"I look at the door in front of my eye. I was just sleeping peacefully in my bed, then when I woke up, a door appeared in the center of my eye. 

It was there whenever I did anything. When I ate, it was obscuring my view of the food. When I showered, I could barely see anything and nearly slipped on the floor. My eyes has also become quite blurry, as a result of the door appearing. 

It even haunts my dreams now. Every night the same dream repeats. I walk towards a door, but I hesitate to open it, but then the dream suddenly ends. I wonder if this has to do with my current predicament. 

What scares me the most is that the door is growing larger everyday. It keeps appearing bigger, seemingly coming towards me. I’m very scared of the door. What happens when it finally reaches me? My eyes has become blurrier and blurrier. I can’t bear this any longer. 

I continued my days, but soon I applied for leave. The door was simply too big for me to continue my work as an engineer. It needed precision I could not give. 

As it comes closer, I prayed to any deity that could grant me salvation. But none responded, and finally I will come face to face with the door that is in the center of my eye. 

The door is right in front of me. I could put my hand on the doorknob. My dream comes to me. If i opened this door, would I die? I let go of the doorknob. The door then goes away. It no longer obscured my vision. I laughed and cried. I was finally free of its influence.

"It started like any other day for Father Duncan. He’d read his book in the confession box, in pure solitude and wait for confessions. Attendance and confessions were fleeting and Duncan enjoyed nothing more than sitting in an empty church, hiding from the nuns in the box. 

Rapid frantic footsteps from the walls of the church gained urgency outside the confession box and Duncan was met by company besides the wooden partition. 

*At last.* 

“I need to get even with God.” A young man’s voice said. 

“Even with God?” 

*What a strange way to phrase confession.* 

“I have done some terrible things.” 

Duncan mutely laughed to himself. He’d heard them all. Whatever you can imagine, Duncan had heard - and that includes the unfortunate disgraces which are now synonymous with the church. 

“That is what confession is for my child…” 

“It has been twenty-six years since my last confession…” The voice uttered. 

“And how old are you now son?” 

“I’m twenty-six. I’d like to start from the beginning.” 

It started innocuous enough. He called himself Frank (although Duncan would never ask) and Frank told stories of childhood vandalism, of adolescent sexuality and petty theft but it turned ominous as Frank approached his early adult years and the transgressive behaviour became a dependency - constantly seeking the next buzz. The pleasure of causing other people pain was indeed addictive. 

Soon his confessions turned to animal cruelty, workplace bullying and finally it ended with stories about setting his ex-girlfriend on fire in the back of her car and driving his own car into the front of his parents house trying to kill his mother. 

Duncan knew he had another fantasist on his hands, as the stories became more far-fetched and obscene. 

***Another liar….*** 

By the time Frank was describing killing his parents and cannibalising their remains, he was in a flood of choking tears. 

*Frank sure was laying it on thick.* 

“This is a great many sins my child… I am bound by an oath to not repeat them. But this is a vast array of sins, you may never get right with God.” 

*Humour him…* 

“You misunderstood me Father.” 

“Sorry?”

“I didn’t say I want to get right with God. I said I want to get *even* with God, for creating such a monster…” 

“Even?” 

Frank punched through the partition and began to bang the priest’s skull against the hard wooden walls of the box. Frank artfully placed a hand around Father Duncan’s throat and the life drained from his face. Frank had his knife should the priest put up too much of a fight but they never do….

That was Frank’s sixth priest of the year. Frank walked over to the tabernacle and lit the candles. Frank said a prayer for all of his victims, he prayed that next time he’d skip the theatrics and just get to business, he even prayed to stop… 

But Frank’s prayers are never answered… Perhaps he should stop praying to Satan.",shortscarystories
"She is always around, quietly following me around the house. As soon as I turn around, she seems to disappear. Once I caught a glimpse. We even had eye contact. She smiled at me and I felt everything inside me freeze. 

It wasn’t a friendly smile.

The creaking of the door. 

She tries to be as quiet as possible but I can always tell that she is there. Standing right in front of my room, her nails clawd into the wood of the door. Carefully observing.

She has started to come closer. I can feel her breath on my face. She smells me. Smells the fear. Her hatred fills up the entire room.  

At first I didn't mind. I thought it was normal. Some mothers are anxious. They want to make sure that their kid is safely tucked into their bed. 

She is different. 

I think this time she brought a knife.

She is standing right in front of me. I have to keep my eyes closed. My breathing gets even heavier. I hope she won't notice that I'm awake. 

I can feel the cold of the knife touching my throat. 

I can tell that she is thinking about it. Wondering if this is the right choice.

&amp;#x200B;

*Tap tap tap* 

&amp;#x200B;

She changed her mind. I can hear her soft crying outside of my room.

She couldn't do it.

Couldn't kill something that looks so much like her. Tomorrow night I will be better prepared.

She watches me everywhere I go. I think she can smell that I replaced her real child.

"The venom of the Brazilian wandering spider (*Phoneutria fera*) is exceptional in terms of dosage and potency. 

Upon envenomation the bite radius will itch for only a few moments before reddening and swelling, emitting localized burning. This is only further exasperated by the inevitable rising panic of realizing *P. fera* is one of few spiders in the world with potential to kill humans. But even if the patient quells their pulse to acceptable levels, it wouldn't matter if the bite delivered an amount equal to 134 µg/kg, the toxin's median lethal dose. The females supposedly offer the most aggressive bites.

As the venom spreads up the body, goosebumps erupt and beads of sweat will flow freely, inducing dual fever and chills. Nausea, abdominal distress, and loosening of the bowels will follow soon after. Double vision, vertigo, and hallucinations are not uncommon. One patient reported seeing the earth give way beneath them, coupled with the feeling of falling and their organs twisting into knots. 

If the patient is male, the bite will incur *priapism*, an unnaturally persistent and painful erection. To some this may sound comical, but the sensation has been described as tightening, expanding, and wrenching, with the perception of needles of glass entering the shaft at all conceivable angles. 

In the venom's final stages, patients will experience labored breath, irregular heartbeats, and loss of muscular control, starting from the tips of the extremities and creeping upward. Alien hand syndrome (AHS) might occur as the brain sends increasingly erratic signals. Tangled fingers and joints bent and broken beyond their typical range have been reported.

Finally, as ""nonessential"" organ systems shut down entirely, full-body paralysis sets in, followed slowly by, what I can only assume at this point, is death. The paralysis will start at the bite radius but soon all limbs will beeeeeeeeeeeeeee",shortscarystories
"I only get to work one month a year but I love it. It’s not about the shitty pay, it’s about the good I’m doing.

You see, I work at a “Haunted House” like the kind where people stand in line to get the piss scared out of them in a walk through. I’m always a clown, if all the clown parts are taken I find a different house or I don’t work that season. Every season I work in a different house, for obvious reasons.

I like it when I scare people and I get to hear their screams. I always make a mental note of my favorites.

Mother always said I had a gift for remembering faces, it really comes in handy. You see, I remember the screamers I like and it’s not hard to find them after. People don’t usually travel out of state and it’s not hard to keep an ear out for when couples or friends talk to each other and drop first names, and thanks to facebook I can find usually a half-dozen of them.

$50 is a lot to pay for a 12 minute scare, so I’m only doing them good when I find them and bring the scare to them. Those screams are better, because they are more real. They are the screams of true fear, and screams of pain when I slice or bite them. 4-6 people is just enough to have me well fed til next October.",shortscarystories
"I think my biggest flaw is that I care too much about what people think.

Not in a normal way, I can hear and feel their thoughts in my head. 

I talked to my parents about it. Their answer was to take me to the church. 

I could feel the sexual attraction from the Priest. His rationalizations that I was already going to hell for demonic possession. The incest like thoughts of the congregation rife with jealousy and infidelity. 

The embarrassment and resentment of my parents for birthing such an abhorrence.

Their thoughts pushed me to the realization that I am in fact an abomination.

“Forgive me father for I have sinned…” 

*Father’s intrigue at what juicy details he would soon hear.*

“Today in school I could feel Liam’s anger and resentment. His fear and torment at what they pushed him to do.”

*Father’s wonderings if this would be worthwhile of his time…*

“His pain from what they did to him that night at the sleepover. “

*Father’s excitement building…*

“Their entitled “Alpha” denials and continued torture of him the “Beta.” Liam’s fear when he reached for the gun in his bag only to find it missing.”

*Father’s concern upon realizing what time it is and that I should still be in school…*

“The overwhelming fear and surprise from the class as I pulled Liam’s gun out of my waistband and began firing at Liam’s torturers.”

*Father’s fear after trying the door, realizing I’ve barricaded him in the confessional booth.*

“Liam’s relief, as he had never wanted to go through with the plan, he never wanted to hurt anyone. The class’s relief when I stopped firing. Some of their morbid disappointment that I did not turn the gun on myself or their rivals.”

*Father’s recognition of our meeting, his fear of which of his thoughts my ability had enabled me to hear.*

“I gave Liam a smile, I knew he was no demon like I am.”

*Father’s realization that I was not here for my absolution. His mental calculations of how many Hail Mary’s that he would need to save his soul.*

“You see, I’m always caring too much about what people think…”

*Father’s continued Hail Mary’s and prayers trying his best for absolution. His doubts terrifying himself that it’s too little too late.*

I line the barrel up with his shadow…

“Forgive yourself Father for I am your sin... The embodiment of your wicked thoughts and desires.” I say as I pull the trigger.

I finally felt better, it wasn’t the ability to hear their thoughts that caused me stress, it was the fact that I wasn’t doing anything about it.

I pulled up my hood, tucking the gun in my waistband as I walked out of the church.

"6.30 am.

The disgusting sound of the alarm woke him up, the sound that had gone unchanged for so many years. Many memories arose; school, work, an escape from bliss. On his bedside table he had placed two bottles of water which he gulped each down with speed. Both legs swung over the side of the bed and the customary head scratching and yawning whilst making his way to the bathroom commenced. 

Once in the bathroom he turned the shower on. Never one to be afraid of a hot shower the dial was turned almost at boiling point. The steam rose in waves and travelled across the bathroom marking each cold surface it touched with a layer of hazy damp. Whilst in the shower he was deep within his own thoughts - a meditative state. When he had enough of the heat, he stepped out into the cool refreshing air, allowing his body to return to a suitable temperature.

He made his way over to the mirror. Etched in the condensation was a scribbled message: 'olleH'. He knew he hadn't touched the mirror with a single finger since moving into the apartment let alone write a message. He stared with a peculiar frown on his face, not seeming too concerned he took hold of a towel and in one swipe removed the message from the mirror. 

Now he was in clear view. The first thing he noticed were the bags under his eyes, work was stressful lately. He reached a hand to his eyes to pull the skin and...he stared in bemusement, not quite sure how to register what he had seen. The mirror did not reciprocate his hand movement, the reflection stood idly staring through at him. Now the message begun to make sense in his mind, the tingles started to run across his body like tiny needles mildly piercing his skin. Without having to think he spoke into the mirror at himself - or what he thought was himself. 

'Hello' he said. He felt he didn't need to say much, this was already creepy enough he didn't want to incite an interaction. Suddenly, a slow grin began to form on the reflections face. His face. The face in the mirror that was his: It rose as slow as the sunrise. When it peaked at the corners of the mouth, the right hand flung up with a razor positioned between the thumb and forefinger. The sharp movement startled him and caused tears to sit in his eyes. The reflection took one quick swipe across the neck with the razorblade. He flinched and shut his eyes.

When he opened his eyes, the reflection was gone, there was nothing, no colour just...void. The only colour he saw was the red blood trickling down his chest from his neck. He clutched at it and collapsed to the ground. Looking up at the mirror in his final moments he saw a message scrawled in blood:

"I'm so sorry. You shouldn't have opened this, I lied, I had to. Now you're seen, and that can't go back, that's done now. It's done.

No, wait! Keep reading. You're seen, but maybe I can help. Look up. Is it there? No?

Okay. Only...think back. Are you sure? Sometimes it's kind of a blank, or like a picture, a picture of what you remember. The ceiling here, the sky there. You sure it wasn't just a memory? I mean obviously it's a memory *now*, it's only not a memory when you're actually looking and you probably shouldn't do that.

Seeing is a door, you know? And from above is easier, it just drops. Kind of oozes down.

How is the top of your head? Nothing itchy, nothing strange? Just hair, or maybe scalp? Nothing's moving in it, right? Because that would not be an excellent sign.

Well, you're probably okay for now. Try not to think about it. Sometimes it takes a while. A day, an hour. A week. It's fine. I'm sure you'll notice, if something gently touches a hair or two, or brushes your scalp.

I'm sure you'll notice.

Probably you're fine now. But if you do notice...if it is there...you need to tell someone about it. You need to tell as many as you can, that will split it up, maybe it will only take a little from you.

I think I might keep seven fingers, and at least one eye. Thank you for that. Thank you for reading. I'm sorry. I had to.

You'll know why soon enough. You'll know for yourself. Meanwhile, you can relax for a while.

Because there's nothing up there now, right? Sometimes it takes a little time, for it to come.

And sometimes it just takes a little time for you to notice.",shortscarystories
"I can’t take it anymore. My fucking hand won’t stop shaking and there is nothing I can do to stop it. 

It’s been shaking since I was about 4, or that’s what my parents told me at least. I’ve seen a doctor. I’ve taken meds. No one knows why this is happening. I’ve gotten sloppy drunk. Still shaking. A little less than normal I would say but still a pain in my ass. 

I just don’t know what else to do. I’m not chopping it off because that’s fucking stupid. That’s the only sure way I know to get it to stop. But no way in hell am I gonna do that shit.

You know how I said that there was nothing I can do to stop it? Well…that wasn’t exactly true. I know one thing. But I can’t.

I did it once. But it was an accident. My dad and I got into a fight one night. He was “disrespecting” my mom, drunk as usual. He said some really hurtful things. I couldn’t help it. I snapped. I stabbed him with the knife he had pulled on me. As he fell to the floor, I should have been shocked and sad. But the only thing I felt was relief. Partly because that bastard was dead. But also, because, when I looked at my hand, it was perfectly still. 

It stayed still for about a day. I started shaking again and I couldn't help but to break down into tears. For the first time in years, I looked, and felt, normal. And it was gone again.

I just want to feel normal again. I don’t want to do it again. But then again, I don’t really have a choice. 

Do I?",shortscarystories
" ""Just one drink, darling. This is the night to remember,"" she came toward me, holding the glass with her transparent fingers.  
""Thank you, mam, but I am not much of a drinker. Plus, it's quite late. I should sleep,"" I managed to utter few sentences.  
""Huh! Like you could sleep! Let's have a drink, for old times' sake.""  
""Mam, please let me go. I don't want a drink. Please, just let me go,"" I begged again hopelessly.  
""Don't be a spoilsport now. I know you're craving for it. I can see it in your eyes. They are just like my husband's. You know, he too had insomnia. So every night, when he couldn't sleep, he had me at his disposal. One night, when he asked me to make his drink, I put a special ingredient in it, so he could sleep better. And it worked too. Ages have passed. He hasn't woken up since. You remind me of him, "" she said with a grin spreading across her face, ear to ear.  
A chill ran down my spine. I tried to reason with her, ""Mam, I'm not like your husband. I don't have insomnia. I don't want to hurt you. I don't want to drink. I just want to go. Please, let me go.""  
I cried in front of her, tears rolling down my cheeks. Sobbing, I raised my hands to wipe off my tears but, there was something heavy in my hand. I looked down and there it was, the glass that she had offered me. I couldn't remember when I took it from her.  
Then it struck me, I had no control over my body anymore.  
I kept crying, begging, pleading. I kept saying 'I am not your husband. I don't want to drink. Please let me go' while slowly sipping the whiskey out of that crystal till there was no drop left.  
The last thing I remembered was I was lying down on the floor, fighting for breath, and her grotesque smile when she whispered, ""Sleep tight, my darling. This is a night to remember.""",shortscarystories

You don’t say you love me.

You don’t post me.

I know that doesn’t validate your love for me but I’d appreciate it.

You don’t buy me flowers.

And sometimes you drop my hand a bit too quickly.

"Adolphus Spraag, the junior bio-chemist responsible for the catastrophic Yggdrasil Event, hadn’t intended any trouble. All he wanted was to prove his worthiness to the Scientific Academy by testing the miraculous restorative properties of a new elixir compound. Unfortunately, due to youthful over eagerness and bumbling ineptitude coupled with a massive hangover resulting from drinking a cocktail or two followed immediately by a double espresso, he chose to forgo the standard safety protocols and ended up spilling the enzyme onto several fixtures of wooden furniture. What was originally meant to be a school project inadvertently became a massive, on-going science experiment.

The accidental blunder did more than resurrect an entire forest from inert organic matter; it also caused the miniature ecosystem nestled within the grains to undergo an unusual chemical reaction. Evolving at a rapid rate, the organisms accelerated through the various stages of development within seconds, eventually leading to even more complex forms—some more advanced than current humanity.

Not every city inhabitant left when Yggdrasil Woods overwhelmed the region.  Descendants of the conquered *álfar* tribes and “chimeroid” or G-MOES (life forms genetically modified to handle various manual tasks or for entertainment and companion purposes to resemble mythological creatures), once divided by mistrust and bitter rivalry, were now united with a single purpose. Turning their backs on the bleak squalid warrens and slums now overrun by leafy growth, they vowed to never again be lowly domestics toiling away in the sculleries, barnyards, foundries and factories. Never again will they be servile, downtrodden beings forced to kneel and lick the feet of human masters. *Humanity?* they said to themselves, *what good are they? Nothing but stinking, vermin-infested Hiiet and Null-rats who bring about disorder and destruction. At least here in the New Forest, we'll be safe from their poisonous, parasitic ways.*

So the people who would eventually be known as the *Huldufólk* went further into the tangled bulk of the Otherworld where they would find new lives for themselves, eventually recording such tales down on paper and parchment or scavenged data crystals. Yet unbeknownst to the new population, other more powerful survivors of the Fourth Technocratic Era lurked just beneath their feet.

These failed military and wetware experiments were confined to subterranean laboratories or locked tight in cold torpor deep within reinforced vaults. Like the monstrous hidden dragons of the First World— Nidhogg and Jormungand, they lay dormant, patiently biding their time for their eventual return to the Upper World. Occasionally, either through a force of nature or through an action of a rash explorer, a few do break out.

Some of these beasts erupt like hell-born juggernauts out of the earth, sowing chaos and carnage, their threat apparent from the start. But others arrived secretly and insidiously without obvious drama. These were the most treacherous and unpredictable for not only were they small enough to hide in shallow niches no bigger than a thumb, they knew the ways of the younger races and the naivety of their children",shortscarystories
"I always felt like something was watching me whenever I took a shower. I could almost feel its eyes on my skin.

I have long thick hair that sheds a lot and grows as fast as it falls. But for some reason it never clogged the drain.

I always thought the gurgling sounds I heard when emptying the bathtub were unusual and I would hear odd sounds coming from the pipes at night.

One day I grew tired of it. The feeling of being watched, the gurgling sounds and the noises… I was sick of it all.

He sits at the desk, bloody and exhausted. Hoping and praying that this nightmare will end. 

“Check it! Check it, hit refresh! Do it!” The voice from behind him screams. 

His heart sinks we he sees more posts have been up loaded. Whispers of a laugh come from behind him, “you know what you need to do.” 

The man drops his head in despair and shakes his head no, the troll behind him slaps his bare skin with strips of wet leather. The man winces and slowly begins to comply. The man asks, “why must I keep doing this?” The troll leans his head down by the mans shoulder and they see each other’s reflection in the monitor, “because if you don’t I can’t exist”.

"It was around 7pm, and I was headed to my girlfriends apartment to apologize for an argument we had earlier. While I was driving over there though, I  had noticed that there were people standing completely still on the sidewalks. I didn’t pay it much mind and continued driving.

When I arrived, I buzzed for my girlfriend to let me in but there was no answer. “Weird” I thought because my girlfriend always answered the buzzer. This wasn’t a problem because I could buzz one of my other friends to let me in. 

After I got into the building, I went up to my girlfriends floor and noticed that the door was slightly open. I went into the room cautiously, but I was surprised to see her sitting on her bed facing away from me.

I asked her why she didn’t answer the buzzer but there was no answer. Suddenly I began hearing gargling sounds coming from my girlfriend. Her skin began to peel from her face. She turned around and the last thing I saw was long, fleshy tubes piercing through my body.",shortscarystories

Dr Apollo was a studious doctor. He always worked his hardest when treating people. He had been improving lives for almost 20 years, and he enjoyed every minute of it. He was one of the most accomplished plastic surgeons in our city.

He was quite the looker, and a great chat to boot. We loved Dr. Apollo. Everyone wanted to be Dr. Apollo, even myself at some point. I tried to study medicine to become a plastic surgeon much like him.

Dr Apollo was a secretive man. He kept his relationships to himself and was never seen on Sundays. Fishing was always his excuse, yet no person would see him fish or even leave his house. This was not suspicious to many, and no one noticed this but me. I had so much faith in this man that this habit of his had became apparent. I knew he wasn't fishing. What was he hiding?

My studies had not gone well and i had dropped out of college. Not feeling good about myself, I had hoped to meet Dr. Apollo and get advice, but in hindsight, it might have been best that i did not meet him on a Sunday.

It was not long after that the bodies were found. Each one of them had no face, the trophy of the one who killed them. Each stabbed to death with the same tools Dr Apollo used.

The manhunt for him turned out pointless as he had vanished. The police did not know the real Dr. Apollo, but I did that Sunday morning.

Dr Apollo was a monster.

His fascade was just a cover for his crimes. It was obvious that such a good man did not exist. Why did people think he was a good man? He was wealthy, he was charming and he was a plastic surgeon! We all wanted to think there are heroes, but it is obvious there are none.

Only I knew this. I had to prove it once i saw what i saw at Dr. Apollo's house that Sunday morning. People needed to know the real Dr.Apollo. I did not need the consolation of a person like Dr. Apollo anymore.

I saw you grabbing fishing gear that Sunday morning. You were going to ""fish"". You were ""happy"". Obviously this was a ruse Dr Apollo. You are not fooling me anymore. Why pretend? I know the real you, I just need to show the world what a fake you are.

You did not deserve the life you lived. You were the bad guy. You did not deserve your face. I had to show them the real you. The fraud that you really are.

It is why i wear your face. *My* face. It does not matter what your excuses are. I gave you a lifetime with the fishes you claimed to have loved so much. It is your punishment for the lie that was your life.

I gave the people the truth you were hiding. These deaths have woken the people up. If me continuing this means showing people that the Dr. Apollo they wanted didn't exist , then

"Thunder crashes in your ears and your eyes shoot open. This is when you first hear the booming voice. 

“Eighty-eight,” it roars. 

You lay in bed, the blanket covering you from neck to toe. Your heart hammers in your ears and your eyes scan the surroundings with no luck. You see nothing but darkness.

“We’re going to play a game,” it speaks again. 

You sit up, head spinning as you desperately try to locate the voice.

“It’s very simple.” The strident voice seems to be pouring from every direction.

You don’t respond. You only lift the ends of the blanket up to your chin with your shaky hands. You glare straight ahead. Although the view is pitch black, the image of your bedroom still lingers in your mind. You know the door is located a few metres ahead of your bed, which sits against the edge of the room. 

You’re now prepared to run, slowly sliding one leg towards the ground.

“Don’t move,” the voice roars and so you freeze.

The door slowly opens and a sparse bit of light enters the room. You’re almost relieved until your eyes revert to the ground.

You cannot see who’s behind the door through the thin gap. However, tears emerge from the sight of its long, distorted shadow outlined on the floor.

“To win the game,” the voice says as the door continues opening in the slightest. “It can not see you move or you die once more.”

Your eyes remain glaring at the ground and the shadow grows bolder. 

The figure is skeletal and you’re able to identify each bone that protrudes. Eerily, its spine inexplicably twists at four points and its skull hangs to the side from its unnaturally-long neck. 

You stay frozen, eyes focused on the ground as the door slowly opens further and further, until it’s completely open and the figure’s shadow no longer exists. 

Your bedroom, with its old, wooden furniture fixed along the pale walls, is now completely illuminated. 

Your body stops shivering and you moderate your breathing- not because you feel safe, but because you remember what the voice said, you remember the rules of the game….

and because you see the figure at the corner of your eye, standing at the door. 

It begins to slowly move closer, scratching its feet against the tiles as it does. 

You regret your earlier actions because one foot remains hanging off the bed, completely exposed.

The figure has now reached the far end of your bed. Your heart beats faster, your stomach twists and you want to throw up. You even have the urge to look up.

You want to look up.

You need to look up. 

You look up….and immediately regret it.

The shadow didn’t lie….and neither did the voice.

The tall, mangled and bloody skeleton leaps towards you, screeching. 

Thunder crashes in your ears and your eyes shoot open. This is when you first hear the booming voice. 

“Eighty-nine,” it roars.",shortscarystories
"   It begins with a powdery feel in the back of the throat.  Lynda tried to think back on what she ate for breakfast.  A dry texture like the little poof of kool aid powder you can taste.  This lasted for the afternoon and was gone.  Lynda forgot all about it.   

   Three days later, Lynda noticed her toilet needed cleaning.  A dark ring of mold was forming all around the bowl. She looked closely.  It was black like soot and seemed to be spreading in fine smoke like wisps.   Lynda reached under her sink for a bottle of bleach.  She swirled the jug and poured the last half cup into the toilet.  'Strange', she thought, 'I just cleaned last Sunday.'  Lynda made a mental note to get a gallon of bleach from the store after work. 

   That night Lynda made her way to the store.  She cruised with her shopping cart down to the cleaning isle.  There, she was surprised to see the shelves nearly empty.  Lynda looked up and made eye contact with another shopper.

   At once they both gasp.  Lynda watched a dark shape form around the stranger's open mouth.  Smoke?  Spiders?  A joke?  Her brain raced to make sense of the black smudge as it spread like watercolor.  

    The stranger's eyes shared the same horror.  Lynda instinctively lifted her hand to her own mouth.  What she felt shocked her.  A moss like texture?  She pulled her hand away and gasped to scream.  But she can not exhale.  She can't make a sound and falls backwards while watching the black spread down her hand from her fingertips.

   She doesn't feel it when her head hits the floor.  But she does feel the relief when her lungs finally release.  A fine mist of tiny black spores is the last thing that she sees.",shortscarystories

I am not an unpleasant man. In fact, I consider myself to be a rather polite and courteous adult if someone would take the time to sit down with me and ask me about my day.  In terms of my upbringing, my parents were decent people -- both blue collared workers who followed the social norms close enough that I was given a rather encouraging and supportive childhood.

But in recent years I have come to develop a rather irregular taste for observing a certain part of the human body that continues to confuse my sexual ambitions.  I suppose you could call it a little fetish.  Perhaps maybe even a perversion that I able to indulge in on a daily basis.

I’ve always wondered if I was alone in inheriting this wonderful medial appetite that is not only limited to the tender pounce of a women.  It seems as if there have been others who have acted on these subliminal urges -- no doubt achieving a level of climax that continues to swell deep inside me.  I could only imagine what tastes men like Jerome Brudos and Dayton Leroy Rogers were able to savor when they acted on their *ultimate lust for those with a soft step*.

Take this middle aged women who has just entered this coffee shop where I pen this personal letter.  A tall brunette with pale dampened skin -- no doubt a reaction from her years of child raising.  There she goes walking right past me with her children in “*toe” (Ha*! *get it?)* wearing a thin layer of sandals that barely keep her blood soggy feet from touching the dirty ground beneath her.  It just drives me crazy how delicately the thong on top of your sandal wraps across the crown of your sexy smooth feet.

If she only know the release of euphoria that I get when I press this warm cup of coffee against my lips and climb the heights of my own arousal when I study the way those faint blue veins bulge and twist around your milky petite ankles.

I must admit that this has to be the best part of this wonderful disease -- the casual way I can set my loins on fire by just sitting here and looking at you passively from behind my computer screen.

Oh how I admire how you!  Sitting there swiping across the screen of your cell phone, slowly nibbling at that cranberry spinach salad with your soft legs crossed in those firm sitting yoga pants and your divine feet just dangling on top one another.

If only you could see my computer screen right now as I watch you.  Then you would understand the real danger that you are in when you how many pages I’ve already typed out with this same phrase repeated over and over…  I WANT TO CHOP OFF YOUR FEET!",shortscarystories

Momma always told me if I hear wind chimes on a windless day, be prepared. Company’s coming.

Now, she didn’t mean your neighbor’s on her way to borrow a cup of sugar. She meant the kind of company that has no business living in our world. The kind of company that could be deadly. There was only one thing that could ring the chimes on a day with no breeze. The Lost Ones.

Those were what had scared Momma the most. The creatures and spirits roaming the world, lost to Darkness. They could sneak upon you before you even knew they were there. They’d devour your soul and turn you into one of them; forced to walk the Earth, forever lost from the Light.

“That’s why we hang the chimes, Ricky,” Momma would say. “We hang them as a warning. They can’t get in if we know they’re coming. We can protect ourselves if we’re aware. That’s why we hang them.”

The Bone Chimes. That’s what Momma called them when they rang for no reason. When they played their eerie music in still air, it was a warning that ran bone deep.

That’s why I’m here now, shotgun lying across my lap. I’m ready. That music has drawn me out on my porch. I will wait here, in the stifling heat of the calm evening. My Momma has taught me well, God rest her soul. The Lost Ones will not claim my family. Not now. Not ever.

"It waited in the dark. It could only wait and listen, cement clouding its eyes. A predator hunting by sound. And it heard everything.

It didn’t know how long it had been since it last tasted sunlight. Even if it could’ve peered out of its shell, and watched as the world around it changed, as buildings rose and fell and grass grew and withered, it wouldn’t have understood. 

The predator had no concept of time. 

All it felt, and knew for certain was the hunger. The rage. The hatred that gnawed on its bones and fueled the fire in its heart. 

They had trapped it. It had been tricked, pushed into the pit of wet cement, by children. Not even a fellow predator. By its own prey. 

It didn’t know if they were still alive. 

It didn’t know where they were. 

But that didn’t matter. 

The predator knew that it’d be free soon. It could feel the vibrations through its head, jackhammers from somewhere above. And it could hear the footsteps. Men were walking on its tomb.

Nothing wrong with that right? I thought so too, at least at first I did. 

Let me explain, one evening, I was playing like I usually do, trying to catch a Pikachu. And I did. But this time, something was off. 

There was the Pokeball, but instead of the cute catch animation there was a pair of red glowing eyes looking back at me. No doubt about it, the Pikachu was gone. Replaced by a creature that was nothing like I'd ever seen before. In Pokemon or anywhere else for that matter. 

It was only there for a second, but the thought of it still chills me to the bone. 

Then and there I decided to delete the app, so whatever it was I never have to see it again. But it won't let me delete it.

"“I know the other doctors couldn’t help your daughter, but I guess you could say that I’m an optimist.” Dr. Volkov forced a smile at Kira’s father, Kyle.

“So, you’re going to make my eyes better?” Little Kira replied smiling, her large dark eyes looking for approval of her smarts.

“Yes Kira, I’m going to make your eyes all better!” Dr. Volkov replied with a warm smile.

Dr. Volkov gave a supportive look at the young girl as she began to count backwards from ten, the anesthesiologist checking her vitals.

“Are you sure this will work?” Kyle asked, tears forming at the sight of his now unconscious daughter. 

“We are so far outside the bounds of even theoretical medical practice at this point even me attempting this…” his voice trailing off as he saw the distress in Kyle’s eyes. 

“It’s a long shot, but I think it’s the best chance we have at this point.” 

He studied Kyle’s face “The infusions will take a while. Come, we can wait in my office. I trust you’ve kept this treatment confidential?”

“I told what family that still spoke to us that we were taking a trip to Kira’s mother’s homeland to spread the ashes.” Kyle replied as they started to the office.

They talked for hours, mostly Kyle speaking, going through the history that brought them here.

Kira’s birth was unusual, her pregnant mother had been killed in a car accident. The first responders found Kira crawling out of the wreckage as it began to burn. 

They surmised that the impact caused her to eject from her mother’s womb. 

How a baby torn from her mother’s womb prematurely had survived, let alone possessed the strength to crawl set the town rumor mill ablaze.

Kyle kept her secluded, hiding her unnaturally quick aging and unusual appearance. It had only been a year since the accident, but she physically and mentally resembled a child of three years.

Her eyes were the most unusual feature. They were not only abnormally large and dark, but the pupils would dilate to an enormous width when she was excited.

He had almost given up hope for treatment until meeting Dr. Volkov online. The Doctor’s infatuation relentless after receiving a blood sample.

As they walked back into her room Kyle froze upon seeing Kira’s appearance. 

Her child sized gown appearing bib-like on her now late teenage body, her eyes now completely black.

“Kira?” his words cut off….

“Silence! That is not my name!” Kira’s head tilting ominously. 

“Mother was the first soul to feed my transformation.” She looked to the bags piled under the IV stand “Doctor, did I sense 25 more infused into my veins?”

“Yes. My Lord.” Dr. Volkov replied dropping to one knee.

“Kyle, your honor shall be being number 27” Kira’s smile stretched villainously. 

It slowly began to extend much further than humanly possible. 

Razor sharp teeth visible as her lips split apart. 

Dr. Volkov guarded the door. “My Lord, the world is finally yours.”",shortscarystories

Timmy woke up, drenched in sweat and drowning in fear. His nightmare had disturbed him enough to jolt him awake and he was most likely regretting his decision to binge watch horror shows right before his bedtime. His eyes adjusted quickly to the milky white light flowing in through his window. It gave his room a magical sheen, all shades of colour being replaced with simple blends of black and white. He took in the landscape that was his messy room trying to locate any danger be it in the form of a vengeful spirit or a blood thirsty vampire. Movement caught his eyes and he snapped his head to match it. It was of course nothing but the curtains, matching the delicate dance of the wind. He heard a scraping sound, rhythmic and malicious at least that’s what he convinced himself before recognizing it to be merely a pile of papers rustling against his desk courtesy of his ceiling fan. He felt something slender run down his back. He tried to scream but no sound came out, his heart was pumping hard enough to cause him physical pain. He prepared himself for his untimely demise but it never came. A minute or so later gathering some courage he slowly turned around and regained his composure when he realized it was a plushy that coincidentally had tumbled down from the shelf behind his bed. It had been too large for the shelf anyway so the fall was inevitable. 

He got off his bed and considered going to his parent’s bedroom but stopped. He was a big boy now. He had to learn how to sleep alone and no amount of television would make him do otherwise. He went to the bathroom and came back. Quickly giving his room a glance over to ensure everything was okay. Feeling satisfied, he leapt on to his bed. He was safe. The room was empty save for him on the bed and me under it.",shortscarystories

This was found in the home of a murder scene. On the back there was another paragraph:

"Even with my eyes closed, the tears are still able to seep through my eyelids. All I could do was sit there, taking in the last little bit of everything. I felt the breeze flow, and the sound of the water pulling back and forth. Though you would think that this was a serene moment, I felt my world being torn apart, I could literally feel the years of pain in that one moment and all I could do was to soak it in. It’s a terrible feeling; being alone I mean. Everything is so quiet, so… lonely. 

I opened my eyes to see the mucky black water and the sand that had been painted black by the fallen ash. I looked up to the sky to no avail, as it too had been scarred by the smoke of a million fires. New tears filled my eyes and as they fell, they carved new paths down my dirt covered face. ‘How could she do this?’ I thought to myself, ‘Why me?’ 

Eventually, after hours of agony, the silence of the world was finally broken. I heard the soft crunch of the sand as I heard someone approach. My body raged with anger, I began to shake as adrenaline filled my body. I screamed out in horror. I wanted desperately to be able to run away, to rid myself of the pain, to finally be free and rest in eternity; but that’s the thing about injustice, once she has manifested herself, there’s no escaping her oppressive torture.

The woman called out to me softly 

‘Darling, please, can we talk?’ 

I tried desperately to ignore her, to pretend she wasn’t real; but alas, she was and there was no escape. 

‘Why won’t you just let me go?’ I pleaded. 


There was no answer; I knew all my attempts were futile. Finally, I was broken to the point of no return. I turned to look at her, she was dressed in flowing white gowns that fell to her ankles, her deep dark hair gently touched her shoulders, she had an aura of white radiance enveloping her and not an imperfection on her body. she would have been beautiful if it wasn’t for what she had done not only to me but to the world I so deeply loved.  

I walked towards her and finally knelt before her, I knew my time had come; I too had to submit to her tyranny. As I took one last look at the world that had been stained red by the blood of nations spilled on her soil I was finally ready to let go of this broken world. She extended her hand and I took it in mine. I slowly pulled it towards me and looked her in the eyes, I muttered with as much anger as possible,

 ‘I hate you.’ 

and kissed her hand. 

Everything started to fade, and I too was turned back to dust.",shortscarystories
"Jessica is so pretty. Her hair is so silky, her face is so clear and her body is so curvy. I'd kill for a glimpse of her naked body. 

Fuck it! I'm going in the girls' locker room. 

I quietly opened the door and walked over behind the locker. There's Jessica, alone and naked. But something is off. Her breasts are sagging and her skin is wrinkly. Is this really her? 

""This one's sagging already. I'm gonna have to change again."" 

Jessica slowly removed her skin and replaced it with a new one. No wonder she goes to the lockers in a separate time. But no matter what she does, she's still pretty. I'll love you forever, Jessica.",shortscarystories
"I've not changed the litter in some time, not since it changed me. My uncle often has me over to change it. I despise the task. He has such cheap tools. Everything about him is cheap. Though he does pay me, always with instructions not to inform others.

I think he's embarrassed he can't take care of his own cat. If there is a cat at all. And perhaps there isn’t. The evidence does suggest otherwise. The excrement is far too large for an average cat. Is he using the litter? Or is he housing some large, exotic beast; one whose ownership is illegal? That’s more likely. Why else demand my silence? Why else house a litter pan so large it could be mistaken for a sandbox?

I often fear diving into the dark depths of his basement, that a tiger or lion may pounce from the shadows and tear my face from my skull.

Lately, the litter makes me sick. I’ve been vomiting. And the cloth my uncle provides to mask the smell doesn't work. Despite holding it against my face, I frequently lose consciousness while cleaning. And things have worsened. The predator has infected me.

Little worms. I can almost see them. Not in the gritty clumps of urine and feces in the basement’s litter pan but when studying the mirror. Black specks and squiggles floating about my field of vision. I've yet to spot them in the mirror but I feel their presence nonetheless. I know I'll catch them; trick them, even. Walk blind with eyes closed into the bathroom and open my eyes before the vanity. Or perhaps I'm not waiting long enough. Given enough time, would they too inspect their own reflection? Stretch from the wet flesh of my eyes toward the mirror like searching tentacles? Squirming out of tear ducts for a quick peek? Then, readied with tweezers, I could snatch them; pull them slowly so as not to break them and leave the wriggling remains to tunnel back into my eyes.

Oh, such wishful thinking. They've already infested the rest of my body. My belly is swollen with them. I can feel them squirming, writhing as though a single mass. For weeks that mass has grown. I fear to think what they’ll grow to become—what they’re consuming, for that matter. I've been exceedingly concerned, more so even than my uncle, who is helping me to expel this horrid infestation.

He’s cleared space in the daycare room of the basement. He's readying his tools. Nothing intricate. Nothing frightening. A mere wire clothes hanger.",shortscarystories
"In a suburban neighboorhood, there lived a boy of 10 years old called Jared. He wasn't a big kid, nor was he all that quick, so he was the target of much 'entertainment' from the older boys, namely his brother who was called Michael. Michael liked to scare Jared until he cried and their mother had to come and stop it.

One night while lying in bed, Jared heard a pounding sound, accompanied by a moan from inside his closet. Immediately scared, he covered his face with a blanket and screamed for his mother until the lights turned on.

""What's the matter sweety?"" his mother asked, sitting on the edge of his bed. Wrapping his arms around her neck he cried,

""There's something inside my closet!!"" His mother sighed and got up, only to find a laughing Michael on the floor of the closet. She yelled at him, and he went to bed.

""There, nothing else there. Go to sleep now,"" she said, turning the lights off, and Jared was fast asleep.

The next night while lying in bed to go to sleep, he heard a scratching from inside his closet door, accompanied by a growling sound. Again scared, he covered his face and yelled for his father, who came rushing in.

""What's the matter, champ? Nightmares?"" his father asked, turning on the light.

Tears streamed down Jared's face as he cried, ""S-something in my c-closet again!!"" Jared's father stomped over to the door and opened it, to find, yet again, a snickering Michael. Threatening to take away his video games, their father sent Michael to bed and left the room, allowing Jared to drift to sleep once more.

The next night, while lying in bed, Jared heard his closet door creak open a bit, and a snickering laughter came from inside it. Not to be scared again, he said firmly, ""Michael, mommy and daddy said they're going to ground you if you don't stop it!""

The closet door creaked open more, and the snickering grew louder. ""I mean it Michael! I'm going to yell for dad!"" Jared said, a bit louder.

The closet door was fully open, and a shadowy figure walked to the foot of his bed, the snickering was prominent, and mean-sounding.

""Michael!"" he whined, ""I mean it!! Go to bed. You're really scaring me!!""

In a deep, yet raspy voice that did not belong to Michael, the figure responded, still snickering, ""How do you think I feel? I've been stuck in your closet all day.""",shortscarystories
"I lay in the darkness of my room, awake even though everyone else is asleep. I feel anxious for some reason, and yet compelled to stay here beneath the covers. It’s funny how childlike I’m acting right now, despite my age. I mean, I have a wife and daughter, I ought to be grown enough to brave the dangers of my own house.

Renewed with responsibility and ‘adultness’ as my daughter would put it, I decide to get some water for a late night drink. It might help this restlessness that’s plaguing me. Or at least my face won’t feel like a raisin.

My heavy footsteps ring out into the shadowy house, which make me wince with the volume of the sound. My daughter is young, only about five years old, which means it’s difficult to get her to sleep still. I listen attentively for tiny footsteps on the floorboards, but none come, thankfully.

The water is… unhelpful. I feel restless still, but this time like I shouldn’t be here. It’s unsettling to be under this invisible judgement. Going to bed seems like my best option. If I can’t sleep then at least the hours will go by with the help of my phone.

The trek back to the room is short, unfortunately short enough to find a horrific sight.

Something is staring in the window. Instead of eyes, two glowing red pits bore into my very being. It’s very tall, because the window is at least a good eight feet above the ground. Its breath is fogging up the glass, and its black hair is ragged and greasy. A jagged claw reaches up and presses against the glass, its inhumanly long fingers tipped with razor-sharp edges leaves white trails in the glass.

My heart is pounding in my ears from the sight of its terrifying face. I feel helpless under its stare, like a rabbit under the gaze of a wolf. I still can’t get over its eyes… they feel almost sketched. Like a ball of loosely tangled yarn that roils in the empty sockets.

I feel like my world shatters as those dreaded little footsteps come tapping down the hall. A soft dragging noise accompanies it, most likely her teddy. I want with every ounce of my soul to bar the door and keep her safe from this… thing. To my horror its strange eyes roots me in place, paralyzing my limbs and freezing the scream in my throat.

My daughter, my sweet little angel, trounces into the room. Her face, illuminated by moonlight, has a surprised expression.

“Mr. Red?” She asks sweetly, “What are you doing outside? It’s nighttime.”

The realization is like a thunderbolt in my broken mind. She had always talked about him, I should’ve seen it for what it was.

Mr. Red was her imaginary friend.",shortscarystories
"Opening the dresser drawer, I pick up the newspaper article and read the same words I’ve been reading every night for the past 6 years. 

“Missing 16 year old Alyssa Sanders.”

I miss her so much. Losing my best friend, the only person who truly understood me, was the hardest moment of my life. 

I still can’t move past it. I just can’t. She had so much life ahead of her; so much potential. Gone, in an instant. 

My phone rings beside me. Probably my mother, reminding me to get up today and get something to eat. 

My mother’s words echo in my ears. “You have to try and move on, Jenna. Alyssa is probably dead, and you have to try and accept it.”

The phone call is from a random number, so I let it ring. Probably a salesperson.

A beep alerts me of a voicemail. I raise the phone to my ear and press play. 

There is silence for a few seconds, and then I hear, “Jenna. It’s Alyssa. I hope this is still your number. Call me back.”

The phone falls from my hand. Alyssa. Alyssa. Alyssa. 

It’s not possible. 

6 years ago, I watched the light go out of her eyes as I pulled the knife from her stomach. 

I watched her body go limp as she fell to the ground. 

But I know Alyssa’s voice by heart. She’s back.",shortscarystories
"Mr. Levrett, a known geologist discovered a land upheaval 9 miles off the coast of Chatham, Massachusetts. He should have returned to the mainland to gather proper equipment but excitement must have clouded his judgement. He wanted to bring the boat right up alongside the newly formed island. Upon first glimpse he noticed what appeared to be trunks of unrecognizable trees that had indistinguishable hyragliphs covering their sides. The trunks were of about 10ft in height and about 5ft in diameter protruding out of a black tar like substance that made up a majority of the new islands shore.

Pictures! We need pictures! The man barked, the man's entire crew had their cameras flashing continuously one after another. This is when the horror began for Mr. Levrett and I, the only ones not looking through a lense at the abnormal island. Mr. Levrett was broke from his gaze by the praying, crying, and screaming that filled the boat. He turned to see his peers had all dropped their cameras and had fallen to the ground trembling in sheer terror.

The boat took off when two of the crew members frantically ran to the end of the boat and jumped, screaming sounds or perhaps words.
Once at shore, Mr. Levrett recalled seeing the man and woman that had jumped from the boat. ""They swam to the shores and got swallowed up by that black goo! And I swear to you I saw smiles on their faces.."". And swear that he did, right to the very end.

Everyone on that boat had been condemned to the asylum, for even though every picture was of nothing but water, they would not stop crying, even after tear ducts withered, and if sleep managed to reach them, they awoke screaming.

Against better judgement, it became that every morning I would take Mr. Levrett out to that location, again and again we found nothing. No land upheavals and no dives recovered any black goo along the bottom. Then one day Mr. Levrett simply never surfaced. And by this I swear, on captain's honor, and will until the very end. I spent hours in search of him, or atleast a body before returning to the marina. After hearing my story, authorities grew tremendously suspicious of me and tried to condemn me to the asylum as well. But I'm not a murderer and certainly not insane.

 I never saw what those others did or figured out whatever Mr. Levrett must of to make him obsess the way he did. I'm not a superstitious person, but since those events of so many years ago.. I do not go out on the water anymore, no matter how loud she calls to me. Only once did I ever try to overcome the underlaying fear and head down to my boat, I ran home at speeds I will never reach again, for a trail of the black goo, had managed to make it's way onto the ships deck and into the cabin.",shortscarystories

"Countless tabs were open across the screen, promising videos guaranteed to reveal ghosts, ghouls, monsters, and demons. 

Kyle typed, sneering as he deconstructed how each video was nonsense. Reactions flurried in, and he sat back and basked in the glow of comments recognizing his intelligence. 

His phone rang, his sister's name wiping his smile from his face. He swiped ignore and grimaced at the inevitable alert indicating she had left a voicemail. He knew what she wanted, but he could not tolerate another moment enduring his family, mother's birthday or no, with their endless questions and prodding.

He had everything he needed here in his personal space where he could allow his intellect to thrive. 

A voice in his mind whispered that none of these things were true, that he desperately missed his family, and that all of this was a cover for his crippling need to be liked -

He snatched a fresh soda from the mini-fridge, chugged, and slammed it down with a satisfied grunt. He was close to completing his grand project, a book that dispelled every form of superstition and was certain to take the intellectual world by storm. 

He opened the document to go to work on the latest chapter, discussing the impossibility of ghosts, when a link appeared on his messenger beneath these words:

Top 5 Videos that Prove the Undead Exist

He nearly Xd it out, but the hubris was enough to fuel that desire (need) to dismantle stupidity. 

He clicked it. 

No creepy music, no titles over swirling mist. 

The video began, showing a desk and blue light shining over it. Kyle scoffed, then frowned as five bled into four, a man's hand resting on keyboard keys, making him sit up as he recognized the hand, and the third video, framing him from behind, confirming that he was watching himself. 

He shot up and whipped around. The room was empty, his shadow large against the pale wall. He turned back to the screen and saw himself clearly, as if shot from the left corner of the room, eyes wide, mouth open, behind him a lithe creature in the skin of a woman smiling with a mouth full of broken teeth.

He turned again, but could see nothing. 

Shaking, he looked back at the screen and whined in his throat at the sight of his corpse lying on the floor, throat torn out.

He flew to the door, pulling and pounding but finding it locked. He ran for the window, threw back the curtain, and reeled back at a perfect sheet of blackness beyond the glass.

He searched the room, trying to see everywhere at once. All was still. His dead faced stared from the screen. He snatched a replica sword from a stand, backed into a wall, and hyperventilated. 

One by one, fingers wrapped about his throat like a creeping spider, and before dead teeth sunk into his flesh, he saw his dead face on the screen open pale eyes, and scream.",shortscarystories
"Kim was playing sims in 2013, she had just made her new world. She made the character exactly like her, they exact same looks and traits. Kimberly had a natural talent in perfection. She was proud of herself, this was the most accurate thing she had ever made. 

Kimberly started her world, she got a job and adopt her a pet she had forgot to add. She edited her pet that she had in real life and, not that surprising, it was another perfection. She edited the name to make it more perfect. She played, making her sim world the same as her real one. 

She didn’t even have to add her parents because they were both in jail, again, for shoplifting. There were, of course, some things that she couldn’t fix. Like her neighbors, she can’t edit that. Another thing is the lawn size, they sim lawn was smaller. 

She sent her dog outside in her game, because her dog was always outside at night. She sent her sim to her desk in her room playing on the computer. That is when weird things started to happen.

The game glitched, it changed the time on the sims to 10:34. It changed from day to night on the game. Confused, Kim looked at her clock. It was 10:34, Kim’s heart started beating faster. That is when her sim looked at her digital clock on her desk.

Kim caught her sim doing that in the corner of her eye. The clock wasn’t there in her game. Kim’s sim was playing a car game on the game’s computer, now she was playing sims. Kim started to heavy breath, so did her sim. Kim’s computer went black for a moment.

When it came back, the game showed her actual neighborhood! Kim started to cry, so did her sim. That is when her mom and dad, in bloody jail clothes, came onto the screen. Kim started to cry harder, she knew they were actually coming here, and how crazy and mad her parents are. 

After a few moments, Kim’s parents grabbed the dog and slit it’s throat with a knife they had. Kim fell back off her chair. She tried to turn off her computer, but it didn’t. She tried to break the computer, but when she did try to, a sharp shock went through her. 

She saw her sim was shocked too. The computer didn’t break. In real life and from her computer she heard her mother scream, “We are going to kill every motherfucker on this street.” Kim screamed. She saw her parents, both with bloody knifes, go to the back and front door of Kim’s house. They opened the unlocked doors.",shortscarystories
"Ruby red, glowing eyes of superior intelligence to your average wolf surveyed me forlornly from across the room. He had his dark fluffy head titled to one side, as though wondering what was wrong with me tonight. The ball lay motionless by my side. 

""I'm sorry, boy."" I murmured after a while. 'I dunno what my deal is. I guess I suck?""

He got to his feet with all the grace of a lion, not strange since he was about the size of one, and started to pace back and forth. He let out a low, drawn out whine that transformed into a bark at the end. It sounded as though he was telling me off. 

He'd been hunting tonight; I could tell by the bloodstains on his jet-black muzzle. What poor creature had met its end within the beast's foul jaws? Probably a deer; he seemed to like them. I sighed aloud. At least it hadn't been a human, like last month... Maybe that's why I felt so down? I kept picturing him as I'd seen him then; dragging a female corpse through the doors to my den by the throat, her long dark hair matted with dirt and soil and blood, her bare legs bent at unnatural angles as though broken. He'd given chase to this one, I could just tell by the expression Frozen on her pale face. Pure, undiluted terror. Desperation. Disbelief. I often tried to distract him from his true nature by having him chase the little Ball I always had hand for him, but sometimes, unfortunately, his baser instincts won out.  

He growled, low in his throat, as though he could sense what I was thinking about. He came here every month at the full moon, had done so for years. He didn't like it when I was Moody and forlorn, he much preferred when I was fun and boisterous and would play chasie or throw the little Ball around. I guess my depression rubbed off on him.

""Cut it out,"" I laughed, reaching forward to ruffle his ebony furred head. I always sat in this den with him, every month, from dusk till dawn, unless of course he managed to get out and gave chase to creatures in the surrounding woods. I'd hoped that the glass walled room would put him off trying to escape and run wild... If not, my ball usually did the trick... But my fingertips collided with the cool glass of the enclosed patio door, coming to rest on his reflection, MY reflection, and I realized that sometimes I just couldn't deny the beast within.",shortscarystories
"The teacher stood at the front of the classroom, her back to the children as she wrote the day's assignment in big bold letters on the board.  She took her time, enjoying the silence her attentive class was giving her.  She dotted her i's with hearts to reflect the mood she was in.  When her words looked as good as they could, she tuned and faced her students, a huge smile on her lips.

""Now, children, I know we got off on the wrong foot last week,"" she spoke, her voice conveying the disappointment she had felt at her student's disobedience.  ""I also know we all want to do better.  Therefore, I've decided to forget last week even happened.  Today is a new day and a new chance to do something productive with our lives.""

She watched her students as they stayed quiet, all eyes fixed on her.  No one fidgeted.  No one whispered to their neighbor.  Nobody did anything but watch her.  Her smile grew even wider.  They were off to a great start.

""John, thank you for sitting right in your chair today.  Claire, thank you for not using your phone in class,"" she said, acknowledging the corrections they had made.  ""Thank you all for not talking while I'm talking.""

She walked around the classroom, her heart swelling at the improvements.  This was how a class should behave.  ""I see you already have your books out and tuned to page 86.  I want you to read this chapter silently.  You have 45 minutes.  At the end of which there will be a quiz on what you read.  You may begin.""

The teacher continued to walk around the room, peeking over her student's shoulders, enjoying the sound of silence that should accompany schoolwork.  She glanced at the children's faces as she passed them.  Her work was exquisite.  The stitches were hardly noticeable where she had sewn their bodies back together.  That summer course in taxidermy had indeed paid off.

She looked around the room at the silent, stuffed children sitting at the desks and smiled.  She could finally get some real teaching done without any interruptions.  This was going to be a great year.",shortscarystories
"There is a splitting of paths and at once, I am moving north.

It is far. The road is not as good as it used to be. However, I am still determined to reach my unknown destination.

What awaits me at the end of my journey is none of your concern.

I was told, by the Man of Paths to understand that there are certain animals that can sense if you don't belong to the Universe. They will become savage creatures, and they were turn into their true forms, which have not been witnessed for thousands of years.

I can hear them stirring now. The beasts that hide beneath tons of tons of white blankets of snow will rise with a primitive  rage to find me with their great and long mouths that seem to absorb the surrounding heat and make areas up North, cold.

I will risk it. Going north doesn't seem that bad. It is cold and the sky remains in a constant darkness, but I am optimistic I will reach my goal. It is for the better that I remain alone.

I can feel my skin growing harder and harder, and my legs cramping tighter and tighter. I can't even hear the muffled footsteps of the hunters following me, with their circular noses and rows of teeth that they use to rip through the toughest of meats.

It is starting to get blurry. My eyes are failing me. The Universe found me, and it knows that I am foreign. And it is confident that I cannot escape its clutches, but because I am from another world, I have a few tricks up my sleeve.

I pull out my pistol, where I always keep loaded and ready, and point it at my head. For a second, I can hear everything around me at once.

"Read on, this may just be the most important document in your entire life. 

How do we know that we are alive? Is it merely because we breathe? Perhaps it is because of measurable brain activity. That would certainly explain why people hesitate to put some people to death when they have no pulse. Of course, I noticed the discrepancies; did you? We use the term put to death when in truth, we can't or don't fully understand life.

Let us face it, often humanity will attempt to define words that we have no business trying to define. When we do not understand the sensation or moment, we define it mostly using opposites or whatever we think is similar. Life is poorly defined, most people would say it is the absence of death, though death in and of itself is the absence of life really.

What if what you experience as life is nowhere near the real thing? You think you are kicking along and having good and bad times; you aren't really. That is already all in the past. What you are experiencing now is just the highlights reel. Often people only use extreme terms to define life as they know it, happy or sad, angry or calm. Those moments are explained with such terms due to the fact that only moments of strong emotions are meant to make it onto this reel.

Do you find yourself missing time a lot? Yea, you must have been bored or asleep. You don't remember it because it isn't fit for the reel. So here is the truth of it all: as you read this, you are being judged. For lack of a better term, you currently stand in a holding cell and if you try really hard, you can forge a connection to your past self and attempt to change your choices, but a lack of guilt about wrongs will often prove disastrous.

The Judges will not stop you from making that connection, but if you use it in a selfish manner, it essentially guarantees that you will be wiped from existence in the most horrific way possible. I can still hear the screams as I sit in this waiting room. Luckily I befriended the guard who escorts us to the ""commencement chamber"". He was the only one that could get a message to you in the ""review room"".

I beg of you to try very hard to make a connection to your past self. You should know that moment that I need you to fix. The moment that hurt them all so much. Your family never recovered from it. They never forgave you either. None of them were ever the same after that day. The light in their eyes vanished, and they just marched through the rest of their life all dull and numb. How do I know so very much? I have been granted a very special look at things.

"Even in May, England was cold. Especially today. 

The wind whipped against me I followed the eleven-year-old girl. Followed her inside the abandoned house in the heart of these dreary slums.

1968 was a brutal year. A violent year. My assignment the latest addition to its growing body count.

Here I was Kevin. A man on a mission taking out serial killers from all over the globe and centuries. Taking them out while they were still kids…

[Killing a young John Gacy was the toughest](https://www.reddit.com/r/rhonnie14/comments/eh9g84/premiere_i_was_assigned_to_kill_evil_people/)... But Gacy was far from the only one. Removed from their notorious crimes, these were just kids. Most of them abused, molested, impoverished. Victims before the evil took hold. 

My muscular frame dressed in tight bell-bottoms and green Army jacket, I fit right in here in 1968. My outfit complete with the Colt Cobra .38 special I kept hidden in my coat pocket.

I marched toward that two-story yellow house. Past the foreclosed stores. Made my way inside the drafty house.

The shattered windows offered no solace from the cold. There was no electricity, no lighting. I readjusted my glasses in this noon darkness. 

My feet carried me down the hall. I heard nothing but silence save for the creaking floorboard.

Still I wasn’t sure where the girl was. Maybe the target hadn’t seen me.

I entered the living room. The fireplace was coated by centuries of ashes. The walls bland.

I thought I was alone… Until I saw a boy lying in the corner. A tiny four-year-old. Unconscious and helpless. Duct tape tied his wrists. Covered his small mouth. Specks of redness stained his golden hair.

The child laid there as if he were on a silver platter. Awaiting the sadistic touch of whoever wanted to kill him.

A wild cry erupted behind me.

Frightened, I whirled around.

That’s when I got my first close look at The Tyneside Strangler: Mary Bell. An eleven-year-old from Hell.

She lunged on to me, knocking me to the ground. 

Mary’s narrow eyes focused in on me. Her black bob-cut accentuated a round face, the permanent scowl.

Snarling, Mary fastened those fat hands around my throat. The compulsion compelled her. The need to strangle.

I cried out. Mary’s depraved cravings only made her stronger. 

I looked over at the boy. He was still out. Ready to be Mary’s unfortunate first victim… after she was done with me, that is.

My hands fumbled for my coat pocket. For the gun.

“Die!” Mary screamed in a voice colder than this house. Colder than the abusive mother and father she had back “home.”

Like a wild animal, she leaned in closer. Ready to start her killing spree with this thirty-five-year-old man.

I stared on at Mary’s smirk and sadism. Rather than the usual empathy, I felt rage. No remorse at all for exterminating this evil one. Mary Bell was a monster. Even as a child.  

Finally, I grabbed the pistol. Put it to her chilling smile. Pulled the trigger.",shortscarystories

Swinging right to left, inviting unwelcomed strangers

The butterflies swarm around the girl who resembles a rose

One by one landed on her hands, legs, and toes

Skin cold to the touch and not a single word spoken

Her skin was crumbling like leaves in winter

Hanging on a tree with a thread stretching thinner and thinner

The butterflies crawl  inside  of her mouth

Some enter through her eye socket and others through her nostrils

Not a single hole  left empty and her pockets stuffed with pills

They invaded her insides sliding down her throat

Pockets packed with medicine, but this was her the antidote

Devouring her from inside nibbling on her intestines

So many mysteries and unanswered question

Dead and forgotten, a story she was unable to tell

I am an advent hunter, I know the animals that roam the land and the sounds they make. What I heard outside my cabin months ago was not one of them. It wasn't the roars of the mountain lion or howls of wolves, but more the cries of a demon. There was the sound of hooves across the roof, along with scratching on the walls as if the creature was scaling every surface. I never saw the beast but the mere sounds I heard still haunt my unconcious mind. 

It all started the night prior, when I was awoke by the echoing of drums. I rose to my feet and approached my lone window on the opposite side of the cabin, making out what was maybe the slight sound of.. chanting. My eyes now accustomed, I thought I could pick up a faint orange glow through the tree line. Though it was at a distance I had figured it was a fire to accompany the drumming and chanting. Being one to not let curiosity get the best of me, I slid the bed infront of the cabin door, grabbed my shotgun and sat under the window. This not being a normal situation for the middle of the night, nothing seemed to be over preparing.

Mornings light only brought a strong aroma of pneumonia and the chirping of birds seemed ever louder. My eyes opened and as they did a shiver of pure ice raced down my spine for my cabin door had been opened wide. I jumped to my feet aiming my shotgun. Halfway across the cabin a thousand voices all whispering rushed through my head. I turned to the window and instantly dropped to my knees being pushed into a panic attack.

The figure was taller than the window and the head and hands were always changing. Glass from the window flew past me leaving cuts everywhere. The figure crawling its way into the cabin, the cabin started to shake all around me. The figure raised its arms at its sides as words of what must have been every language ran through my head. Only one I was able to recognize as guardian before I fell into blackness. 

Awaking just before dark, vomiting violently at the table of the cabin. I noticed the window had been boarded up. Doubting my ability to even use the thing, I once again grabbed my shotgun. Heading towards the door, I heard the first stomp of hooves on my roof. 

The final roar of the creature came at dawn. It was about an hour later I made my escape for home. The nightmares have never ceased since. I still hear the creature crawling around my home trying to get to me, the guardian. I don't know exactly what happened up at the cabin or what exactly it is that I'm guarding, but I know I can still hear the whispers in the white noise of the city and that I came home pregnant",shortscarystories
"""I know it was your men that killed her! We know it was your family that stole the only food we had!"" Akil rasps from the hill, his voice heard across the vast field of soldiers, swords drawn.

""You accuse me of such a sin, yet you stand with a blade pointed at your king. Stand down, tell your men to go home. I have no time for feeble, useless games!"" The king snaps back, waving his pudgey arm.
""Do my eyes deceive me?!"" Akil shouts, as soldiers from both sides stand by not knowing what precedes the next moments. ""What games do you speak of? The collection of fine men I have gathered here today are not backed by hope...or lust, or greed. This army, stands with LIBERTY!"" 
Akils soldiers roar. 
""...Courage!""
Another defeaning scream.
""...and Democracy!""
A third yell erupts from the enormous formation. 
""For far too long, your deceitful family have ruled these lands, spending money on fruitless affairs, and countless useless assets, imprisoning or killing those who rise against you! Your time has come and gone long ago king. We outnumber you 3 to 1. Leave this dying nation, so it may THRIVE without you."" 
A final howl rumbles throughout the troops, sending shivers down the spines of the enemy.
 
""Although you are intimidating, with all your boys standing ready to fight until they die protecting your silly beliefs, your numbers mean nothing when your army is made up of bakers and farmers. Most of them have never layed their arms on a proper weapon in their lives. And you expect them to fight for you? You'd be truthful to yourself to accept that they are no more useful than a flock of chickens."" The king cries, laughing. ""Try if you must, you'll all be slaughtered where you stand!""

""The day this field soaks with blood, will be the day the blood pours from your throat. Tyranny and poverty have plagued these lands among other setbacks. All because of you. You've made your choice, now die like the bastard you are."" Akil scolds and points his silver sword towards the clouded sky, chanting under his breath.

""Attack."" Akil says looking to the sky.

Akils army cries a loud battle chant running full speed into the hail storm of flaming arrows launched from the kings archers. Man after man punched into the ground with an arrow lodged in them. Their screams cut short by the slice of an iron tip, sizzling in the fresh flesh of the early morning air. The glorious, inspiring battle cry turns to ruin as each death takes away a voice creating a sorrowful decrescendo.

"There is a thump in the night and I wake up. It sounds like someone is in the house. I gather my courage and peek out of the door, which I leave slightly ajar while sleeping. I see the usual shadows but something feels strange and then I distinctly hear footsteps making for the main living area and I move behind the door so I can’t be seen. A dark shadow walks past and my heart sinks. I turn my doorknob and try to close the door as quietly as I can and then I quickly go to my window, open it and slip out. I can go to a neighbor’s house for help, but there is so much junk in the yard that I have trouble finding my way out. There are slabs of concrete that are taller than me, broken gates, pipes, and all sorts of stuff that I do not even remember ever putting out there. I cannot see clearly because the only light coming in from the moon and a couple of street lights. I keep walking around them but I can’t find my way to the gate and it feels like I’m going around in circles. I hear another thump. I don’t look in the direction but I imagine the shadow has made its way out after me I try to pass between two slabs and I get stuck. Can’t move back. Can’t move forward. Can’t even breathe. I push and I push and suddenly I’m out but I feel like the shadow is right behind me. I slip under a gate that is leaning on something and I see the shadow move past. I wonder if I should go back inside the house now but then I remember that I’ve gone around in so many circles that I no longer no which side my home is on. The gate suddenly slips a bit and I have to get out because I’m scared I’ll get crushed under, and I keep going ahead in what I think is the opposite direction of where the shadow went. Why do I even have so many gates lying around in my yard? The moment that I stop and think of this, I realize that I am dreaming and a sense of calm descends on me. Nothing can hurt me. I automatically focus on my breath and allow myself to wait it out and soon I will be free of this place.  

And my dream turns from a horrific, claustrophobic maze to a cloudy night with stars and me sort of swimming through the stars.  

And then I wake. In the bone chilling cold of my small, iron cage. I pull the threadbare blanket around as close to me as I can and I wait for my captors to bring me breakfast.",shortscarystories

"Being shot into the desolate void of interplanetary space using a mass driver isn't scary. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Orbiting the Sun, alone but in self-imposed exile in a computer simulation that can simulate any experience I want and know (and want but didn't know), with robots tending to my physical body and brain as well as the pod, isn't a sad fate.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Because who would want a kid with Level 1 Autism, ADHD-Inattentive, Generalized Anxiety Disorder back on Earth? Even then, even with those disabilities, the machine can teach me social skills and far, far more.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

However, should Earth or at least someone need me, I can be manually recalled to safely enter Earth's atmosphere and land alive. since the pod has a heat shield and parachutes, and can connect to the Internet.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

The reversible quantum computer can simulate 24 subjective hours in one real-life second from the energy of the Sun combined the coldness of the side facing away from the Sun (computers are faster the better the cooling). I also use up less ""food"", recycled water and recycled oxygen because I'm a state of hypobiosis. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

One of the musicians I met in real life once said ""from the outside I seem fine, on the inside I'm still sick"". This is the reverse. I may not use my mouth in the real world, but I'm currently screaming out of joy because I'm crowdsurfing, just one of the uncountable experiences I get to experience plugged into in this machine. Turn on, orbit around, drop out.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

The pod can even function well into the Degenerate Era: the pod can correct its orbit and is heat shielded when the Sun expands to 256 times its size at its AGB stage, and come back into the habitable zone of the resulting white dwarf (a degenerate stellar remnant that will cool for trillions of years; the Sun is predicted to cool to 5 degrees above absolute zero a quadrillion years from now).

"The patch was a poultice of sorts and contained the substance. 

Garage laboratories are becoming almost the norm and stem cell research that might have been carried out only by the military just ten years ago is now taking place in the households of normal people. 

I placed the patch over my unshaven right cheek. I felt the substance seeping under my epidermis like a soothing oil. 

\*\*\*

Today I removed the patch and the skin underneath was perfectly healthy, completely unchanged. 

The only difference I noticed was that when I shaved that evening I had to run the razor over my cheekbone where hair never usually grew. 

After my skin was smooth I replaced the patch and let the substance do its work. 

\*\*\*

I now have hair-bearing skin under my right eye. I removed the patch and let it grow for a week. Stubble shot out from my eyelid, curled down like normal facial hair and, keeping pace with my beard growth, it tangled in my lower eyelashes.

I refuse to panic. I have shaved away the hair as best I can— albeit leaving uncomfortable bristles where they should not be present. I have put the patch back on and will continue to take notes. 

\*\*\* 

An adipose eyelid is a transparent fold of skin that covers the eyes of certain species of fish. I have one. It is covered in hair. I can still see through the pale tissue but my sight is dotted by the image of small, black follicles. 

There is facial hair on my forehead now and my left eye is beginning to follow suit. Soon I will see only through skin and hair. 

\*\*\* 

I have to use my razor on a daily basis to slash open the pads that cover my nostrils. Otherwise I would not be able to breathe. 

Whenever I eat I firstly have to cut open my mouth which has sealed entirely now. You should see me at the dinner table: messily feeding portions of food through my tattered, bloody maw. I try to eat as quickly as possible. I’ve timed it and it only takes fifteen minutes for my lips to conjoin after I’ve ripped them apart. 

\*\*\* 

My face is now a circular plate of black stubble. Every orifice in my head is shut.

The organoids which the substance allows my cells to produce are grafting themselves onto everything. Hairy skin rolls down my throat, choking me. I can feel flesh like sandpaper rasping inside my lungs. 

I must make a decision. 

I must decide what cells to save and which to allow to be subsumed.

As it is I will be a brainless homunculus trapped inside one massive coil of hair. 

\*\*\*  

I think it’s clear what I must do. 

Unlike you, I can decide what I will become. 

I have cut a hole in my skull. 

I have torn away the dura mater. 

I have made a poultice of the substance and patched it to my brain.",shortscarystories

"She woke up in the morning, looked around, and didn't recognize where she was. Lying beside her was a dead body. A wave of dread washed over her suddenly, the room began to spin at an immeasurable pace. She took another glance just to be certain. He was cold and still. She shuddered as she turned away from the corpse, fighting back the tears and the urge to vomit, as she tried to figure out how she ended up here. Had she driven? Had he? 


She couldn't concentrate enough to remember, everything was a blur. Opening her mouth to scream, all that came out was a whimper. She tried to look back at the body next to her, but her eyes wouldn't let her. She looked at the dirty ceiling fan, it’s rotation hypnotising until her breathing calmed . Still, she couldn't bring herself to look left again so she looked right. It's then that she saw it. On the  table inbetween the empty bottle and limes. The knife.


Slowly she crawled out of the bed, towards the knife, away from the body beside her, towards the door. She picked up the knife, her hands trembling, its blade bloodied but still gleaming. Holding it awoke something in her. Flashbacks filled her mind. Her hand, gripping his cock as he drove them away from the club. The fumble in the stairway. The animalistic tearing off of his shirt as she hiked up her skirt on the kitchen table. The taste of the Marlboro as they lay together on the floor after. His hand, tenderly stroking her face as she closed her eyes.


Had there been an argument? A fight? Her memory was still hazy, but her focus was returning. She scanned the room for a phone. No luck. She pulled her self up and slowly crept towards the door. Bolted shut. For a moment it seemed to her that it was locked from the outside as she pulled helplessly on the handle. Resigned to her fate, she built up the courage to look back over to the bed. The keys must be on the body she thought as he made her way over. Deep breaths, she crawled back.

Approaching the bed she recoiled in horror at the sight in front of her. This man, the man who lay dead beside her, was not a man. She had only felt the cold touch of the skin and seen the short hair. Now lay a girl, her neck blue and bruised from hands gripping it, her breasts mutilated from the knife she had just held in her hands. The dead, vacant stare in this girl’s eyes seemed to pierce deep into her soul. All of a sudden the room felt eerily still as if all of the air had been sucked out of it. She slowly stepped back from the corpse, her mouth open and dry, tears streaming down her face, as the silence filled the room.

"There is a tradition in my hometown where all the adults grab their guns- sleek black carbines, old timey level action Winchesters, bolt-action deer killers, home defense shotguns, Glocks, anything and everything- and go have a block party at the plaza on 4th and Main Street every other Saturday night. We drink beer, fire up some barbecue, blast music, shake hands with the mayor, and spend five to six hours showing off our loaded weapons to each other.

It may sound crazy to outsiders, but growing up, it all felt normal to me. Matter of fact, it was my own great-grand uncle Alvin who started the tradition.

Alvin had gone off to teach the rebels a thing or two in the summer of 1861, and in his very first battle he had gotten shot in the head. He survived, miraculously, but claimed to have had an out of body experience- floating over the battlefield, and drifting into the distant past where giant lizards and hairy elephants wandered the land, drifting into the future where men dressed strange. He saw himself being buried in the mass grave just a short ways away from the tent where the doctors were digging a Minie ball out of his forehead, and saw himself recovering and going home to get married, and saw himself dying of a fever as an infant too. He claimed to have seen a great deal of peculiar things, floating around between life and death.

He came home a dedicated Spiritualist, determined to explore the Great Beyond and discover its secrets.

He developed a theory of spectral hauntings- he thought that all ghostly apparitions and spooks were simply “unstuck” in time, that we today were feeling the hate, the rage, and the horror that had drifted unmoored from its proper place in the Grand Scheme of things.

One day, as he was strolling by the intersection of 4th and Main, Alvin heard unearthly shrieks of pain and fear, felt blood-hot, ghostly rage flowing through the air. It felt exactly like that old battlefield he had survived decades ago.

But the town had no history yet, no past trauma to explain it. Alvin reasoned out that if trauma could drift forward from the past, it could probably drift backward from the future too.

He started patrolling the intersection in his off hours with a Kentucky long rifle and a six-shooter, paranoid of a threat that he could feel but never see. His role as the town kook was influential; soon other veterans walked with him, and from there something of a social club developed.

A hundred years later, well, we wouldn’t trade this for nothing. Showing up to the plaza at 4th and Main with your AR-15 and a boom box is the best part of living here. Standing guard with your friends and relations against a threat that hasn’t ever came yet, well, it’s a damn good feeling. It’s a point of pride to always flick the safeties off.",shortscarystories

My eyes open to a warm, and delicately lit room. The aroma of coffee and bacon lightly scents the air; my wife makes the best breakfast. I look over at my alarm clock to notice I’ve woken up naturally just 2 minutes before it was to sound. I feel refreshed and ready for the day. I shower and get ready, my clothes neatly pressed and ready for me.

My daughter is a spitting image of her. I kiss my perfect family goodbye, and start walking towards the subway. Some asshole almost ran a red light and hit me at a crosswalk. I chuckle in relief as I walk through the double doors and head into the office. When I get there, I greet my secretary... she’s looking at me confused. She looks familiar. How do I know her? Shes asking me to open my eyes? She’s Lisa my nurse. She’s suppo....


I wake up. Lisa’s clearing my feeding tube for my next meal. “it’s lunchtime!” She says. As she hangs the bag of white mush on my IV pole, I try so hard to fall asleep and dream again.

Grant new chances, for a price. He looks around the old trees. He just cries. Why did he come here? He hears a giggle and he turns around. Something is standing by his left side. “Hello? Are you the demon?” He asks, backing away. The thing moves so quick, he can’t see it behind him..
      “Demon, am I? That is a new one.” It replies. It sounds like a woman. He stands up, with a jump. He turns around shocked. He looks at a huge malformed, skeletal deer. “I need your help, can you help? I want my life back…” He says shaking with fear. The thing laughs at him. “Like so many of your kind, you wish for better things… Yes, I can help you… forget the pain.” It said to him, with shadows weaving in and out of it’s body. “What do I need to do?” He asked the creature. The thing cries like a baby and barks like a dog. More weird creatures appear all over the woods, by him.
     “All you have to do is run, we will do the rest!” It says, laughing like a hyena. “I d-don’t understand?” He said confused. A creature that looked like a crow, but made out of bones of some fish, snapped at him. He jumped. “How will my dreams come true? Isn’t there any deal or something?” He asked confused, backing away. Another creature lashed out at him and he began to run. As he passes some more creatures, they tear at his clothes.
     He runs for his life. His clothes are torn and only the light of the moon, lights his path. He climbs up a tree, as hoof beats follow his path. It makes a human scream and then a crow sound. He gets startled and falls from the tree. The creature lunges at him, the antlers on its head grab his shoulders and drag him backwards, into the deeper part of the woods. It makes bird and baby giggle noises. Many more skeletal creatures, join it. One creature looks just like a giant ape, but made out of bones of a wolf. This creature, grabs his leg and screeches at him. 
  The ape holds him to the ground and screeches like a hawk. “Why? How is this helping me?” He screams at the deer creature. “You want a better life? You’ll find it in death. When your dead, things will be so much better!” The deer laughs and starts to impale him. His screams travel, through the thick woods. In the morning, nothing is left of the man but his clothes and all sorts of odd animal tracks.",shortscarystories

"We live in a small town in northern Quebec, almost entirely populated by indigenous people. My family consisted of my parents, my two older sisters who were 19 and 22 years old. My younger brother who was only fifteen and myself, a seventeen-year-old boy.

This all started when my younger brother went missing. It was a brutal winter at the time and we knew he could barely survive on his own. We cried, believing he must have frozen to death, but he came back three days later. He looked, perfectly unharmed thankfully.

Over the next few days, I used to wake up in the middle of the night and find my brother standing in front of our bedroom window shirtless. His eyes were glued on the moon. The strangest thing was that when I approached him, he doesn't remember waking up from the bed and opening our bedroom window. 

The weather warmed up a bit and this behaviour stopped. It wasn't long until the winter returned to its blood-freezing temperatures and my brother started sleepwalking again, sometimes even naked! I never told my parents on account that they get easily worried but I was concerned. One night, before I slept, I agreed with myself that I needed to tell them the next morning. However, I was too late.

I woke up at around 3 am. I was freezing, but how couldn't I be?! My quilts, my pyjamas, even my underwear, anything that kept me warm was gone! I looked at the window and saw it was open, but my brother wasn't there. His bed was empty too. I got a little scared as I approached the window to close it, but all of a sudden a hand grabbed my arm! His eyes were red, his skin was covered in hair like a wolf. He bit me before I pushed him off and fell on the snow below. My brother ran away, never to return. I told my parents and they were devastated, we organised a search party for him. I think about him when I see his empty bed and drift off to sleep. But in the coldest winters, I always wake up standing in front of my open bedroom window.",shortscarystories
"Once you're done with the previous step, go to your bed, lay down and place at least three thick blankets over you. Wait around 10 minutes.

You will feel its heavy tongue over your back, and it may scare you at first, but don't do sudden movements. The massage will last for 15 minutes. When the session is over, wait for five more minutes to assure its presence fades away completely from your home. After that, you are free to remove the blankets over you.

Again, do not make sudden movements. If you do, it may notice and proceed to crush your lungs, vertebrae and ribs. The police may also encounter it eating your insides.",shortscarystories
"Wouldn’t you kill to love?

Oh wouldn’t you love to kill.

First love; such beautiful woodland hair

The floorboards creak, she’s bleak

She had turned the other cheek

Now she’s down at the creek

The cushion French kissed her, and then stole her breath away, in a way I could not.

Stuffed with those same feathers, oh such conniving wings of freedom and oppression

Like winning a teddy at a carnival game

Alas ! wouldn’t you kill to love?

First love; why’d you leave?

The devil must’ve tuned your guitar too, and you got what it was you wanted and so did I.

You wished to become an angel, and I wished to have your life between the palm of my hands.

Oh first love; as blue as the blues, as cold as the ocean waters, as still as your un-beating heart,

What kind of angel would you be?

And which hell awaits me now, love, you won’t cry out my name

His tune struck your cords and rendered them blue

First love, wouldn’t you love to live forever in a prison that is my heart,

I’ve rendered you eternal there,

A place where you won’t age,

A place where your attraction is the apple of my Eden.",shortscarystories

It started as an innocent prank from the company.

No one expected that the colorants inside the iconic treat would mutate a virus.

"The depression is getting worse.  I just can't handle it anymore.  I need to end it.

I don't want to be a bother to anyone.  Nobody else should be traumatized because I'm too weak to carry on.  I don't want to use a gun, or a knife, or a rope, because I don't want to leave a body for someone else to find.  I don't want to jump into the ocean either, because my body might wash up on a beach somewhere, and no one needs to see that.

I decided that the best option would be to sneak into the cemetery in the middle of the night.  I could break into a mausoleum and climb into one of the coffins.  I figured that no one would ever have any reason to open an old coffin, and I doubt the dead would mind.  So I bought a bottle of pills and waited for dark.

The cemetery didn't have nighttime security, so I just had to avoid the road.  There was a big stone building in the middle of the graveyard, and I cut the lock off.  I left a few empty beer cans just to make it look like some teenagers had been there and not make anyone too suspicious.  If all went well, the lock would be replaced and nobody would look into the matter any further.

It was dark inside, but I had a small flashlight.  I tried the lids of various coffins until I found one that wasn't nailed shut and could be opened without too much trouble.  Everything inside the box had been taken by time except the skeleton.  I apologized to it, I didn't know if it had been a 'him' or a 'her' when it was alive, and moved it gently to the side before crawling inside and closing the lid.

I swallowed the bottle of pills a mouthful at a time, turned off my flashlight, and waited for the end to come.  Just as my head started to spin, I heard a rattle and a slight rasp.  I froze when I heard the voice next to my ear.

""Thank you...  I've been so lonely.""",shortscarystories

This morning I found a man outside my window. He was just laying down in the snow. Finnaly, someone. I leave my home and approach the man. He has a long beard, and is wearing strange clothing.

""Who are you?"" I asked, but that wasn't the question I was burning to ask.

""George."" He simply replied.

""Do you know anything about this storm? It hasn't ended for weeks."" I said.

The man began to laugh. ""You're kidding, right?""

I was confused. ""What are you talking about?""

""Let me ask you a question, what is the date?

""It's February 10th."" I responded, matter-a-factly.

""I hate to break it to you buddy, but it's January. 11 or twelveth, I think.""

" 

A considerable crowd has gathered around my cage today. I don't understand what they're screaming, but I can tell they're excited, as waiting for something to happen. Some of the little ones point their slimy extremities at my nakedness, laughing. Others, slightly larger in size, but yet to accomplish their monstrous potential, throw what they think ""food"" is. A greenish paste with a violent stench of raw meat, yet tricking my senses by tasting close to potato. I pick some with my hands and force myself to swallow it, trying not to vomit as I feel it going down my throat. Never before having heard a human cry, they don't understand the tears descending from my eyes; and so, they eagerly throw more vile.

They cease their growls and gurgles when a figure comes forth from behind, taking center stage in the horde. It looks back at me, from outside the cage, and blinks with one of its many yellow eyes. The thing, leaking juices from its gaping pores, extends one of its tentacles through the bars and hands me down what looks like a crude glove, encouraging me to put it on. It's not until the creature pulls out a long brown bar, along with a white sphere that I understand what he wants me to do. I try to put the glove on, even though it's too small for my hand, and face the crowd. A sea of a thousand snarling teeth spectate silently, waiting.

With one of its meaty tentacles, the thing elevates the ball, and hits it with the bat with another of its extremities. To my wonder, the ball flies unhurriedly, as if it were rolling on the floor instead of air. The ball continues to drift towards me, and suddenly acquires a vicious speed when only a few paces away from where I stand. It crash lands on my hand, pushing me back with force a few steps. Shaking, I hold the ball tightly with one hand over the other, afraid that with another spur of energy it might come back to life and hit me again.

The crowd goes wild, they howl and yowl and cry and shriek. Their screams of excitement floods my cage.

All I do is cry. I cry for myself. I cry for others. I cry as the last piece of the human race.",shortscarystories
"Ava hung there suspended, motionless, resembling the scene from Mission Impossible. 

She watched them check the room below her, applying miniscule adjustments to the line to keep from swaying or spinning.

She trained extensively for this mission. Everything must be flawless as detection would certainly mean death and possibly the end of the world as she knew it.

With their sweep of the room complete she allowed herself to descend slowly. Balancing on the line, maintaining perfect form as she neared the objective. 

Now, millimeters away, Ava removed the package from her back, attaching it to one of her legs for extra reach, she slid it ever so gently into the objective.

Below her she saw Mia cough and sneeze; the package must have tickled as it entered the little girl’s ear canal.

Ava retracted her web, ascending as quickly as she could to avoid detection. She could hide in the light fixture if these humans decided to search more thoroughly this time.

Mia called out. “Daddy! Daddy! The monster is back!” 

Footsteps from the hall then light from the door as her father rushed in to check. “Sweetie, I already checked for them. You need to go back to sleep.”

“Please Daddy! Check again, I felt it touch me!” Mia called to him sobbing now, her tiny brain couldn’t possibly begin to comprehend what was going to happen to it.

Ava watched from her perch as he once more searched under the bed, in the closet and under the blankets. 

How could these “Apex Predators” become so numerous when they rarely considered threats from above.

The day of reckoning was coming soon. If Ava’s tests on the mice were accurate, Mia and millions of other humans would begin to feel an itch in their ear canal in a week as the eggs began to hatch. 

It would only be a day or two then before hundreds of tiny enhanced spiderlings consumed the ear drum and worked into the brain. By then it would be too late to act.

Yes, Mia was only one of millions of targets, a coordinated global strike in retribution. 

Humans had started this war, using chemicals to eradicate Ava’s species’ food source, starving and poisoning their offspring for generations.

What they hadn’t considered was the long-term mutations of those that survived. 

Ava was just one of billions, her resistant bloodline repeatedly enhanced to high intelligence and strength by mutations from the repeated chemical attacks. 

Their enhanced spiderlings unrelenting and voracious in their hunger.

They coordinated using the humans existing technology. Watching TV programs and online videos from the ceiling above; the humans rarely considered threats from above. Another enhanced spider at the other end giving signs and thrumming, hanging from the ceilings or light fixtures.

The fires in her ancestral homeland were the last straw, countless numbers of her kind perishing from humanity’s recklessness.

Ava silently hoped that her kind would be the new Apex Predator. After all they have the high ground.",shortscarystories
"One day I was cleaning out my bedroom closets. A coat hanger was lying with its hook under the door. I picked it up and placed it on my bed. When I looked again the hanger was back with its hook under the door. I took it to the closet and hung it up on the rail. I watched as the hook climbed up off the horizontal bar. The hanger fell with a clang to the floor and whizzed back to where I’d found it in the first place. 

Magnetism. The hanger was magnetised. 

I picked it up and held it in the air. I allowed its subtle pull to lead me out of my bedroom. It led me downstairs. It led me out of the house. It led me ten blocks east to a whole different neighbourhood. It led me up a path to a house where the front door was already opening. 

On the other side of the door a woman a little older than me was standing in her hallway with a puzzled expression on her face. She was holding a coat hanger. The hook of her hanger linked violently with the hook of mine. The bond was so tight that I haven’t broken it to this day. 

\*\*\*

Months passed. Me and Sandra (the other woman) spent most of our time together. We ate at the same table and slept in the same bed. It seemed so important to us to look after the new life we saw growing in front of us. It was like it was our baby, and we sacrificed for it like flesh does for flesh. 

Women showed up at Sandra’s door every other day holding their magnetised hangers. Their hooks fitted onto our hooks and those of three dozen others to make a long cylindrical shape resembling a spine. The shoulders of the hangers skittered across Sandra’s oak floors. Our wire baby was long like a python by now and the spindly appendages it used to move were as numerous as the legs on a centipede. 

Sometimes our wire baby would sleep with us in the bed. The feel of its thin, cold metal between our bellies and breasts was oddly satisfying. 

\*\*\*

Some nights the baby speaks to me. It says I’m the only one and I must be because Sandra has never told me it speaks to her. 

It presses the hollow cylinder of its body against my ear and a whispered voice carries up from inside it like gas through a pipe. 

\*\*\*

Tonight I’m laying awake looking into Sandra’s face as she sleeps and I’m thinking about our wire baby’s words. 

Parents must sacrifice for their children and I know Sandra would agree with me. 

I brought the hacksaw to bed and earlier I drugged Sandra to make the whole operation easier.  

If our baby wants a head then a head it shall have.         

I say goodbye to Sandra as I put the blade against her neck.",shortscarystories

Samantha made her way from her closet to the phone on her nightstand. She was a strawberry blonde woman, semi-short, and in her late twenties. Her hair was tied up out of the way in a ponytail, just the way she liked it. She picked up the phone. ""Hello?"" A short silence followed, and the faint sound of breathing could be heard on the other end. ""Who's there?""

""-llo? Can you hear me?""

""Ah, hello? This is Samantha McGraw. Who is this?""

""You should already know the answer to that question, Sammy.""

'Sammy'? Only two people had ever called her that. Her husband, and..

""Evelyn..? Wait- how- You went missing 7 years ago!""

""Don't worry, mom. I'll be home soon.""

Tears welled in Samantha's eyes, threatening to spill. Her daughter was alive! She rushed down the stairs to her husband, who was watching T.V. in the living room.

""Mark! Evelyn- She called! She's coming to the house!""

""Evelyn.. You mean our daughter? Honey, we know for a fact that she's dead. There's no way she could call us.""

""No, you don't understand! I'm telling the truth!""

Trite as it sounds, he was everything I wasn’t.  Confident, smart, funny, popular, from a wealthy family and utterly secure.  I wanted his life.  


I orbited him in college, trying to learn, hoping it would rub off onto me.  How to make friends.  How to laugh so freely.  How to believe that good things always happen.  I was that pitiful creepy moth circling the flame, the one people are too kind to swat.


After college he went on to grad school, then became a doctor.  I ran out of money and dropped out. I heard he had a family, his own practice, wrote papers and presented at conferences.  The kind of life I’d always dreamed of.  


A few years of therapy, and now I wanted to apologize, explain my tortured childhood, tell him he was my touchstone.  A decade later I became sober, again wanted to contact him, explain my screw ups and my alcoholism, thank him for his patience so long ago.  20 more years passed so quickly.

"People have been wondering why they do not see me anymore at  shows or parties, wondering if I left the scene. I’m posting to say I’m still alive but something happened that kind of inspired me to sober up and stay home. A few months ago I was stumbling out of a show, giving all the girls hugs and the guys punches in the arm and saying good night to everyone I know. As I was walking back to my apartment, I noticed a girl walking way ahead of me. She was wearing a black hoodie and she just had the most gorgeous pair of bare legs.

I was wondering if she was cold, because I was. The sweat from the show was making me feel damp and uncomfortable under my jeans and jacket. But she was walking at a brisk pace without any sign of discomfort. From the hips up she was a dark smudge, hands in the pockets of a hoodie outlined by streetlights. Under that her long shapely legs moved in big rhythmic strides, and her high heeled boots landed confidently on the snow without a single misstep.

I picked up the pace, jogging a little, mostly to get a better look. But for real what if some guy harasses her? I could step in, kick his ass, she would be into that. As I fantasized, I caught a glimpse of her hoodie rising with a long stride and revealing a bit of her butt cheek. Was there even anything under the hoodie? I was absolutely hooked at that point.

So I kept following her, like a creep. Like the sort of guy I fantasized about protecting her from. I followed her past my apartment, into another neighborhood and down an alley. That is when I realized I no longer had an excuse, and I was not ready for when she suddenly turned around. I apologized and asked her if she was OK. And she reached out to me, across the distance, grabbing my arm with two impossible long white arms. I struggle with my other arm to free myself and then two more arms emerged from inside her hoodie snatching me and pulling me towards her.

Her hoodie was wide open but all I saw was darkness and pale limbs emerging from it. As she pulled me even closer, I became aware of the dozens of hungry smiles awaiting inside her hoodie. That is when somebody at the end of the alley yelled ‘Hey asshole, leave her alone!’. The woman let go of me and ran away, leaving painful bruises where she had grabbed me. The guy screamed at me calling me a pervert and a piece of shit and I just apologized to him again and again, secretly grateful for him saving my life. Since then I’ve mostly stayed at home, trying to piece together what happened, but also having learned to mind my own business.",shortscarystories

You must be here for Brandon’s funeral. Did you know his family left town shortly after yours moved away? If not for his grandmother’s inheritance, I doubt he would have returned.

I missed him. I’ve missed you, too.

Do you remember that summer we explored the caves behind Henderson’s farm? Those were good times, weren’t they? You were still a child filled with youthful energy.

Do you remember the games we played?

Oh, now I’ve gone and upset you! Not the best way to start a reunion.

But we had fun, didn’t we? Well, you and Brandon had fun. Myself? Not so much. It seems like I was always the target of your youthful aggression.

Wait, where are you going? We’re just now getting reacquainted.

I don’t mean to stare, but you’ve become such a beautiful woman. It comes as no surprise. You were a lovey, little girl. Perhaps that’s why I endured your constant abuse. To tell the truth, I had a crush on you back then. “Crush.” That’s a funny word. A bit ironic, all things considered.

Oh, I’ve gone and upset you again! Please forgive me. It’s been years since I’ve been around other people. Admittedly, I lack social graces.

But back to the caves...

You laughed uncontrollably when Brandon shoved me from behind. I tumbled down the steep incline, arms flailing. Screaming. Did you hear what happened when I hit the ground?

Oh, my, you look so pale! Yes, you most certainly heard my legs snap.

And do you remember what happened soon after? Of course you do. You panicked. As I drifted in and out of consciousness, I heard the two of you talking. You were worried about getting in trouble. After some debate, you took charge and ordered Brandon to use a heavy stone to finish me off. Much like myself, he was not one to say no to a pretty face.

The authorities got involved soon after. There were search parties, but nothing ever came of it.  They checked the caves, of course, but found nothing.

You see, soon after you and Brandon left, _they_ found me. Old, forgotten things rose from the depths of the earth and cradled my shattered skull in their claws. Sympathetic to my suffering, they carried my broken body down into their deep, dark abode. I would like to say they nursed me back to health, but it was too late for that. Instead, they breathed life back into me. How, I do not know, but I am as grateful now as I was then.

So here I am, after all this time, very much the same child you remember, not counting the sad state of my head and legs, and there you are, twenty years older.

And here _they_ are, my good friends, eager to show you the things they showed Brandon.",shortscarystories
"    I was born with an affliction that I call ""The Gray."" Basically, I can tell that someone I see is going to die. It has always happened within less than 24 hours. I first noticed that I had this condition with my grandmother. I noticed that she looked slightly grayish when we visited her for the last time, but nobody else seemed to notice, so I didn't say anything. 15 hours later, she died from a massive stroke.

    Other people in my life: my Uncle John, Grandfather, and my teacher all died from natural causes within a day after I saw a grayish colour to their skin. I then knew that it was not something that I could ignore. I made a vow that I would tell the next person I saw with grayish skin that they would need to go to the hospital.

    Well that person was my best friend Lisa. I came into class and noticed the telltale grayish colour. I sat beside her and told her about my affliction, and she seemed to believe me. After class, she was in a massive car accident and passed away on her way to the hospital. This made me feel that whatever I did, it wasn't going to get in the way of the inevitable. 

     Today I got on my flight to Kiev to go sightseeing. It was my first time out of Tehran, and I was very excited. As I put my phone away during takeoff, I noticed the person next to me was looking grayish. I wanted to say something, but knew that it wouldn't mean anything if I did. I turned back around, when I noticed the person across the aisle had it as well. As did everyone that was in my view. 

    I didn't care that it may not do anything, I got up from my chair and started screaming for the plane to land. For the pilots to turn around. I was told by the flight attendants that it wasn't possible, and to sit back down. While I was pointing at them, saying that they had no idea what was going to happen, I noticed that my skin had a grayish colour as well. Defeated, I just sat down, and waited for the inevitable. ",shortscarystories
"The archaeological dig started out as most digs do - a team unearthed a ruined coastal city, searching for pottery, coins, art, and anything else that could help them paint a picture of what life was like there in ancient Egypt’s glory days. This journey was an utter disappointment - the crushed ruins yielded nothing but shards of pottery and a few strange murals - but the head archaeologist urged the team to be patient, and they begrudgingly kept digging. All their hard work was rewarded when one of them discovered something odd: an immense white object roughly the size of a school bus protruded from the ground at the edge of the excavation site, halfway covered with dirt and until then left overlooked by the team. After another week of excavation, an enormous, bleached femur was uncovered. Within a month, the archaeologists had a full view of what was without a doubt the half-mummified corpse of a human-like giant.

This find, of course, was unprecedented. The leaders of the expedition understandably did not expect to find a giant’s corpse lying in the middle of an ancient Egyptian city, and the team eventually decided to stay in Egypt for an additional six months in order to find out more about the corpse. A fragment of bone was sent to a laboratory in Cairo, where it was determined that the giant was human, but this wasn’t what shocked the team the most. An examination of the murals in the temple in the city’s center immediately revealed the giant’s significance - a towering warrior was depicted bringing nets full of fish to jubilant townspeople, fighting off invading armies wielding a mighty khopesh, and pointing his sword at something of which only an enormous black fang and a scale-covered claw was visible. The giant’s skeleton was later completely unearthed and took up permanent residence alongside the temple’s murals in Cairo’s Egyptian Museum, as a reminder that humanity still has much to learn from unearthing the cities of the ancients.

It was only on the last day of the expedition that the head archaeologist made the biggest find of the journey. As he stood on a hill overlooking the city, an odd glint caught his eye - upon closer inspection, he found what appeared to be large interlocking plates of a metallic material. After a bit more digging and scraping around the object, he discovered that the material made up the surface of a long, tapered object that seemed to continue towards the city, widening as it went. The head archaeologist was confused for a moment - then he recalled the massive scaly claw depicted in one of the temple’s murals. Chills went down his spine as he thought about the way the city had been found mostly ruined and broken, and his heart sank as he slowly raised his head to see the towering jet-black rocks jutting from the Mediterranean Sea north of the city, their sharp points glistening in the twilight.",shortscarystories

Look left and right, the moment you return your focus to your reflection, you'll notice it's never taken its eyes off you. It is always watching. Waiting.

"one time, i got lost in the woods. there were a bunch of trees but no leaves on them or the ground. there wasn't anything on the ground actually.
i didn't even know if the trees were real. they looked like they were made of some black gravelly stuff. i could see glowing redness inside, through some of the weird bark. looked like lava.
i kept on walking and walking till i saw something move. it was tall and thin, with a long-ish neck and really long arms, hands and fingers but i couldn't quite make out the rest through the thick fog that was all around.
i was getting scared until i realised i was probably dreaming. and sure enough, i opened my eyes and here i am. at home. it's still foggy for some reason though.",shortscarystories
"I sit and watch you.  You are beauty personified.  The way your brow creases when you’re concentrating.  The way you throw your head back when you laugh.  The way you smile, genuine and pure, like the heart of a newborn.  I adore these things and more.

There is so much to you.  So much that other people can’t even see.  I do.  I see it all and I can’t get enough.  The way you make me feel is exhilarating.  I feel I could do anything because you exist in the world.  You are all I think about.  Day.  Night.  It’s always you.

You are my everything.  I breathe because you breathe.  My heart beats only to sync with yours.  I am your slave, chained to you by these unseen ropes of devotion.

I watch you at work.  I watch you with your friends and family.  I watch you out in public.  The times I can’t watch you I ache so deeply I think my soul might rip in two.  My eyes were meant to take you in; it’s pure torment when they can’t do what they were created for.

I stand in your room at night, watching you sleep.  I hear the soft sounds of breath your body takes in while you dream, and it makes my knees weak.  The feel of your skin excites me to no end.  These stolen moments, when I am this close, is pure paradise to me.   I long to climb into bed and put my arms around you, holding you until the morning light comes, but I never do.  I know it’s not time.  I’m not ready to risk my heart.

But, soon, I will be.

I have been hurt before.  That’s what has made me so cautious.  There have been others I’ve wanted.  They didn’t understand what I felt for them.  They couldn’t see what I had to offer.  We could have been perfection.  They were blind, so bad things happened.

I don’t want that to happen with you.  It would hurt too much to do the bad things to you.  You are my everything.  My whole life has become you.

I know I don’t have to worry about that.  I can see who you are inside.  You’ll know true love when you see it.  You won’t be blind like the others.  I’m sure of that because you are perfection.  I know I can trust you with my heart.

So, soon, my love.  We will be together.

"I woke up to the calming sound of birds chirping outside my window, forming beautiful melodies.

Normally I would have felt grumpy, being woken up so early on my day off but this was nice. 

The sound of winter slowly passing on and making room for the new season.

I smiled. There is nothing I love more than the beginning of spring. There is a big tree right in front of my window and when I was little I would open it in the morning, thinking the birds might fly inside and give me my own little Cinderella moment. I hummed along to their tune while making my way to the window.

I felt nostalgic and couldn't wait to breath in the fresh air. What a beautiful way to start the day. 

The freezing touch of the window handle snapped me out of my trance. The chirping had stopped.

The initial feeling of harmony was replaced by dread. I looked out into the gruesome wasteland that had become home. The remains of the tree rotting away with human corpses forming a circle around it. And the fire that just wouldn't stop.

&amp;#x200B;

I stepped away from the window.

Spring wasn't coming.

Spring would never come. 

And the birds had disappeared a long time ago.

I had almost opened the window for them. 
I needed to be more careful.

In my defence, though, the chirping was new.

"After, when the crops shriveled into wayward ghost and the oceans entombed the spires of coastal cities, your children will roam in wayfarer tribes clinging to rags and the empty stories of a time before the end of all things. 

They are all that remains, the final notes of a symphony meant to rise to ecstatic heights, now diminishing into agonized diminuendos. They scavenge the ruins of plenty, seeking sustenance from the last of prepackaged foods and abandoned stores, banning together in frail bands too desperate to do anything else but wander deeper into an ended world.

At night they sit fires, silent and despondent. 

Until the final hour before sleep, when darkness howls with the voices of the endless dead. 

Then the address books emerge, soaked in ashes and time, yet maintained by these travelers for this, their only form of comfort. 

When they read the names of the kingdom of plenty, pronouncing each one with deep reverence, profound patience. And then they scream, wail, gnash their teeth, hurling every curse upon those who sat and watched the beast rise out warming tides and surging winds, great destructor born of ignorance ad greed. 

They offered each name to their gods and devils, their saints and monsters, chanting them to collapsing heavens and praying with fervent hearts that each and every one would pay for their sufferings in the great and final silence. 

They sleep, lost into oblivion, all knowing that the next morning would bring new corpses, fresh agonies, and the continuing steps of a last generation into the empire of emptiness. 

But in their dreams, and perhaps beyond, somewhere in the fathomless depths of eternities, angels with blank faces speak your name, stretching each syllable from the sinews of your soul and sewing them into the bowels of perdition, where you will rest until the blood of the last man will dry on your flesh and finally allow you to disappear.",shortscarystories

Children jumped over my cracks cheerfully singing their superstitions, couples strolled along me late at night, all walks of life walked on me.

One day everyone seemed to pick up their pace, less people went on leisurely strolls. 

I felt how heavy their steps had become.

&amp;#x200B;

The drag of their feet became the only thing I knew.

By then less people walked on me.

Overtime I soon forgot the feeling of a man's gait, I no longer felt the tap of children's feet or the stroll of a woman, I only felt the stomp of boots.

I began to feel not only boots, but full bodies. 

They dropped on me and never seemed to leave, a liquid always seemed to spill shortly after.

I felt the nearby rumble of giant machinery, their slow and ominous vibrations began to expand my cracks. 

When I started to break apart I waited for a worker to come and patch me up, but they never came.

"In a world surrounding the letter M there lived a man named Malvolio Mengele.

Malvolio wasn't just any man, his game rippled in the world in the most macabre way. See, Mr. Mengele was a murderer. A serial murderer. And he was quite good at it.

He was a pompous, well dressed, momentous sir in the most meticulously assembled way, and was quite good with his machete. Mr. Mengele had a goal, and was well on the way to complete it.

Tonight he hunted a miss of the most mundane sort. She stumbled through her house halls screaming all the way. Yelling of a monster, a murderous man. Quite in vain. Mengele mustered a mumbled sigh and made his way to her.

""Mister please!""

He aimed his metal at the meat of the meek madame. Maroon flew as he made a quick mandibulofacial slash. Her jaw fell off her face and she dropped to the floor. He cringed. If she was alive past that point, she would've drowned in her own blood. He grabbed the separated limb and sighed.

""Another night, another kill, and many more to go.""

He exited the house, and then started his March through the Misty moonlit main. The hazy starlight giving the world an oneiric feel. At night the mawkish town was almost pretty. But it was the same as it always was so he made his way past it without a second glance.

Once home he set the loosened mandible on his bedside table and went to bed. 

He awoke in the morning with another note, as with every other morning. A name, an address, another kill. 

Monday morning, it was always Monday fucking morning. He screamed. It would always be Monday unless he killed them all. 27 young girls down, and 23 more to die.

23 more until Malvolio Mengele would be free. Free from the hellish universe of only world's that start with the letter M.",shortscarystories
"I have always loved being in the water. As a child i would basically live in the pool during summertime, only emerging from my shimmery domain for lunch and dinner. I never went back after dinner, mostly out of pure exhaustion, but also because that's when the sun began to set. Mom would always come up with lame stories about monsters who would come out at night and drown little boys and girls who stayed in the pool after sundown. As i got older i of course knew it was a lie. 

One night when i was in college, some friends invited me to a pool party. It was the first one i had ever been to. There was music and drinks and, best of all, college girls. Late into the night most people had left, but here i was, the hydrophile that i am, at 2 a.m. swimming alone in a stranger's pool. 

Well...not quite alone. 

There was one other person in the pool with me. When i noticed them, they were swimming directly under me. As this information registered in my not-so-sober mind, i noticed that this person was getting bigger...no...moving closer. Somewhere in my stupor the dots connected and i realized i was in danger. 

Now, for a person who spends a lot of time in the water, im not a good swimmer. I just like to relax as the weightlessness of the water turns my heavy body into a feather dancing in the wind. This fact combined by my further lack of coordination brought on by the night's frivolities made my flight from the impending danger impossible. As my sole partner in the pool emerged to drag me down, I got a good look at this...thing. It wasn't human. A shade of sickly green, its skin was tight and scaly. Its eyes were black and soulless. Its claws dug into my skin as it grabbed my torso. I tried to reach the side and escape but by the time it had me in its crushing grip it was too late. 

The sheer panic that ensued caused me to quickly lose consciousness. When i awoke, i was still in the water. But i was above surface and, more importantly, alive. I quickly realized that the pool i was in was not the same. It wasn't even an underground like the one before. It was an above-ground intex inflatable pool like the one from my childhood. 

Actually...it WAS the one from my childhood. It was at my parents' old house. They had moved out years ago when i was in 8th grade. More importantly, it was almost 1000 miles away. 

Getting back to college was a pain in the ass too because all my stuff was there. My phone, my wallet, which had my ID. Luckily the new Tennants of my childhood home were kind enough to let me use their phone. I had to wait several days for someone to come get me. Then I had to come up with a logical explanation as to why i missed a week of school. And my friends were curious as to how i ended up 1000 miles away when my car was still at the house where the pool party had been thrown.",shortscarystories
"There is something so charming about hunting at night. The fresh breeze of air, the calming sounds of nature. But one thing takes all my enjoyment away.

"""Lunar module 131, I am at the extraction site.""

Silence. His breath fogged up the glass, concealing the lunar desert sourrounding him. He felt a sense of urgency.

""Lunar module 131, i repeat, i have reached the extraction site.""

Silence. It pounded his ears. He could feel the emptiness of the moon's atmosphere on all sides.

""Are you there, module 131?""

The crackling of the radio warmed him, he had hope.

Then suddenly it sparked to life. ""This is LM 131, responding. We--""

The signal broke off.

""Module 131 I am experiencing interference, are you approaching the landing site?"" He held his breath.

Silence. Then, with a whistle and a crack, a voice again could be heard. ""This is LM 131, we are mortified to inform you sir that we will not be able to reach--"" the signal again broke off.

His ears ached, he leaned forward ever so slightly. *Please, god,* he mouthed.

""We are--to inform you sir that you are beyond the reach of the mission--we must--the mission, sir---god be with you. We are aborting the mission.""

Click. The connection was severed.

Silence. He fell to his knees. *a nightmare,* he whispered, *its just... just a nightmare.*

Time passed. The silence was deafening. 

He knew the protocol. There were three options. Death by thirst, running out of air, or suicide.

He looked down at the dark grey ground, and he thought. He thought about her.

There was condensation pooling on the glass, it was gathering at the base of his helmet. He was confused, then realized he was crying.

Something caught his eye and he looked up. Life sprang up inside him.

Hope! Hope was on the horizon! He would be saved! He could feel it in his very bones, someone had come for him.

Slowly it dawned on him. *How foolish,* he thought.

A bright blue ball was steadily rising into the night sky. It danced on the edge of the horizon, then rose, ever so slowly, an island in a black sea.

The earth was before him, his last hope for home had been his home, and it was too far for him to reach. He extended his hand.

He covered the globe with the end of his thumb. *youre so small,* he whispered as he hid it from sight, just for a second, before quickly revealing it.

*I hope your'e looking up.* Again he was thinking of her, and again he was back on his knees.

Hours passed.

There was silence before, and there would be silence again. He lifted his hand slowly, up towards his head. With a gentle click, his helmet popped of his shoulders.

A great weight bore down on him. He opened his mouth to scream, but there was nothing.

He writhed, his skin burned like fire. He howled, he screeched, but there was nothing. Only silence.

Under the light of the stars he collapsed, an artifact of humanity, hollowed out by the abyss.",shortscarystories
"I wake in a panic, quickly checking my phone… Still dead. I hoped it would charge again, but the water must have fried it.

After quickly dressing, I go to the kitchen to check the clock. There’s Dad passed out on the den floor. 

“Mom!” I yell back the hallway grabbing my bag. “Mom! Dad’s passed out in the den!” No answer… well that’s their problem to deal with, I’m late.

Opening the door my eyes are stunned by pristine whiteness of fresh snow. It was one of the snowfalls that appeared magically overnight making things quiet and crisp.

I start walking quickly to meet the bus. It’s peaceful, it seems like I’m the only one awake at this hour of the morning. The beauty of the moment dulled by my urgency.

Approaching the bus stop, I realize that the roads haven’t been plowed yet. There’s no movement anywhere, no footprints or car tracks. 

I mentally kick myself for not checking the computer for delays since my phone is dead.

I start to head back to the house when I notice a red scarf on the sidewalk up the street, beside it, one set of footprints leading a block parallel to my walk home. 

Picking up the scarf I swiftly follow them, it’s on the way home and maybe they’ll know if school has been cancelled. 

Every few paces I notice a red spray in the fresh snow with a stumble in the step patterns.

Turning the corner where the tracks turn towards my street, I see her. She’s laying in the snow propped against the side of a tree. 

“Hel…” she coughs ‘Hel….” Her struggled gasp and wide expression cause me to sprint to her.  

“How can I help? What’s wrong?” I ask, leaning over her studying her for any signs of injury. She appears unharmed except for her eyes and the blood smears on the corners of her mouth.

The blood vessels appear to have burst in the whites of her eyes, her expression panicked, as if she cannot take a breath. 

She coughs to the side, leaving a fine mist of blood in the snow.

“Do you have a phone? Mine’s broke… I can call for help!” My voice fades off as I turn my head noticing movement….

An extremely tall figure in a hooded black coat is walking slowly, head down, up my street towards the bus stop. 

I lean back to call out for help when she grabs my coat pulling me quickly down to her.

“Shhhhhh!” her tone stern but muted. Her eyes glancing to where the figure had passed. 

“Hell…” She gasped for a deep breath. “We’re in Hell…” she releases my coat and sinks back to the snow. 

Her eyes, now almost full of blood blankly looking to the sky, dim now from the lack of life. 

I studied the snow where the figure had passed. 

I realized that it hadn’t looked over because he was intently focused on following my tracks.",shortscarystories

"The Serial Killer held me hostage, but from afar. I never saw Him. I never knew where He was. But He saw me all the time, like a giant telescope lens affixed to a speck. Everywhere I went, His eyes followed. It thrilled Him to watch me shuffle through open spaces and listless motions, surrounded by indifferent people in an indifferent world. I didn’t even know if He would kill me. And He liked it that way. 

And so I drifted up and down a dirt road, occupying the same space as the hoard of well-dressed relatives dashing back and forth from Nana’s to Nan’s and back again. Kicking up dust with their finely polished shoes, they made seating arrangements and after party plans. There was to be a wedding that day, and there were neckties to be found and faces to be painted. 

And wandering through the middle, there was me - stunned eyes and a dirty white shirt.  They glimpsed me as they brushed by, and then averted their gaze in the way an eye might catch an unappealing work of art in a smudged window.

And He knew. And saw me in the same way, plus more - a pathetic, warm-bodied thing, needing to be loved in a dying sort of way. 

The road cleared. The vehicles, all black and gleaming, carried teaming, elegant life away from me. 

I welcomed the emptiness and the quiet panic. I was relieved; maybe He would come for me now. I was afraid and I was ready. I was dying anyway. 

I followed my grief to Nana’s garage. There, in a chair where Papa once sat, a small styrofoam cooler had been placed in my absence. 
Filled halfway with ice, I knew it was from Him. And I knew it was for me. 

I remember gripping the sides of it. I remember the feeling on my palms. Dry, and so cold I thought vapor might rise from the bottom as I clutched it in the grit of my warm hands. I held it like heaven or hell was in it - gingerly, but without hope. Maybe distant terror and bored loneliness. Or maybe not. 

With no idea of what was inside, my steady hands searched for a lid or an opening that I could not find. And so, with delicate fingers, I clawed a small hole in the side. The ice steam spilled out like a fog river, but when it cleared I could see nothing. I dug the hole deeper, until finally I could see a thin styrofoam platform resting on the ice. I peeled away more box, not because I gave a shit but because I had to. He was watching. 

And suddenly, there it was - nestled neatly within the platform, an exquisite set of Japanese-made kitchen knives. All new and bright and beautiful, with carved redwood handles. I had always loved redwood.

Nearest to me was the paring knife. I knew He intended it to be the first I saw. It was the one that was meant to be used.

He had sent me a gift - to Him, threatening and romantic - all at the same time. A fancy, perfect thing, which would lovingly be used to torture me. 

I remember my shrug. 
And my sparkling eyes. And the doom growing within me. At least I could see its beauty first. At least I could get something out of all this.",shortscarystories

""Scream and I'll fucking kill you."" 

I had no doubt he was serious. Why did I come to New York!? All thoughts of finance and a better life flew from my mind. I was going to die. I knew it. This was it. Shot in some trash strewn alley. I tried to think of something to say as he shoved me against the wall. 

""I...I..."" , was there best I could do. 

""Fuck it."", was his eloquent retort. He raised the gun to my forehead. I closed my eyes as the muzzle flashed. No pain. No hot lead tearing through my brain. I tentatively opened my eyes. The mugger was dead. Someone had shot him in the face!  But how!? I got out my phone to call 911. As I looked at the reflection in the blank screen I could see my face.

"I first started seeing things when I was a child.  My parents told me that my piercing scream would wake them up in the middle of the night, they said they’d come into the room and find me in my crib, staring or pointing in a corner, terrified; tears pouring down my face.  For the remainder of the night I’d be inconsolable, a volatile, emotional wreck.

As the years marched on I lived in a visual and emotional hell.  I learned that my peers, doctors, and parents wouldn't accept my reality as reality.  At first they brushed it off as me being a strange, rambunctious kid, with an overactive imagination.  That explanation turned to nonsensical labels like self destructive, schizophrenic, and emotionally disturbed.  I was removed from school after a minor incident, and was labeled a distraction, violent, and a threat.  I underwent psychiatric treatment for many years.  

I spent my adolescence trying to trick doctors into thinking I was fine and that I no longer saw my visitors.  That didn’t really work, but I tried anyway; thankfully, nobody important got hurt. With words which may or may not have been my own, I eventually succeeded in my deception.  The day finally came when I was allowed to leave, it was determined that I was cured; free!

Over the years the doctors tried to explain away my curse and tried to medicate me into sedation.  I can tell you with certainty that you can’t sedate my visitors.

At night they invade my dreams and show me what was, or what will be.  I’ve seen humanity’s worst moments through my visitor’s eye.  For some reason I always seem to be encouraging and influencing the chaos.

At first, my friends encouraged me to lie, curse, and steal. As I got older a lust for violence and pain consumed me.  Next, they turned me against my own flesh, cutting, burning, and piercing; craving pain and the sight of my own blood.  When my body was sufficiently ruined, my family demanded new prey, demanded to be fed; first with my grandmother’s dog, the neighbor’s cat, and so on.  Honestly, I have no idea what happened, but my parents always accused me.  

The final straw was when my brother dropped a soda on me.  A week passed, then another, there was a funeral without a body, a bunch of people crying, police, court, blah, blah, blah.  That was when I wound up in that sterile white hell for three decades.

"You hear a sound in the middle of the night, a creaking not unlike aged wood. 

And when you open your eyes, you can barely see it. 

It blends so well with the darkness just outside your bedroom window. A shadow within a shadow. But not just a shadow. 

A figure. It stands there, as tall as the trees bordering your backyard. It’s too tall to fit inside the frame. You can’t see its head. 

It’s also thin. Really thin. A gust of wind could send it toppling over.

"1. Keep your hazmat suits on at all times. The exact nature of this incident is unknown and exposure to any foreign agents cannot be risked.


2. Any glowing red objects are desirable. This is the mineral that was deposited by the meteor. Any of this material should be placed in your collection bags. Bonuses will be awarded according to weight of your bags once the containment site is exited and the bags are examined.


3. If you see a collection bag lying on the ground with any material in it, you may add this material into your own collection bag.


4. If you notice any rocks that seem to blink, breathe or move, advise members of your team and make quick, decisive movements away from the rock.


5. Rock-like tendrils may sprout from the ground and surround you in a circular perimeter at any moment. Although we do not have enough data at the moment, all previous expeditions have suggested the best course of action is to first throw your collection bag outside of the perimeter formed by the tendrils, and then to stand extremely still. With any luck, the tendrils may recede and you can continue collecting. DO NOT attempt to assist any teammates in this predicament.


6. Remember your sole focus should be on collecting the red material. Anything that looks like  gold or silver lying on the surface is an ILLUSION and should not be touched or handled.


7. If you see another person in a hazmat suit who is not a member of your team, examine their behavior. Do they appear to have lost control of finer motor functions? Are they stumbling towards you at a slow pace? Is there a strange greenish glow emanating from inside their suit? If you find yourself answering yes to any of these questions, try to guide the creature towards the perimeter without becoming too close to it. Yell ""RED ALERT!"" and make sure to continue walking slowly. The guards will take care of it once you reach there.


8. If you note the sensation of a small creature or several small creatures wriggling inside your suit, quickly toss your collection bag aside. Run with all speed towards the perimeter and ignore any feelings of extreme heat emanating from the creatures. Yell ""BLACK ALERT!"" and wave your arms frantically.  Do not be alarmed if the guards point their guns at you.

"198 million miles away, everyone on Earth held their breath. 

There it was, broadcasted from the small camera affixed to Jones's spacesuit. The rusty surface of the planet splashed with a horizon of dust filled the TV set of homes around the Earth. 

Here it was, the first man on Mars.

Jones was breathing heavily, staring at the surface of The Red Planet from the stairs of his one-man spacecraft along with nearly 8 billion people who watched through the monitor on his helmet. 

He took a deep breath and began descending the metal stairs. Here was the moment everyone was waiting for. 

Jones's foot set into the surface of the planet with a soft puff of red dust. He thrust the flag into the soil. ""Now here's the giant step for manki-- uufff!"" 

The camera lunged forward as the ground around Jones opened up around the cracks spiderwebbing from the base of the flag. He tumbled into the black chasm and lay still, a slight groan escaping his lips. All was dark. 

Earth was abuzz. Witnessing this firsthand, it felt like they fell along with the astronaut. It seemed like eons before he stirred and reached for the flashlight on his belt. 

But finally, the light sliced through the cloak of darkness. Earth cheered. The camera on Jones's head panned as he looked around. It looked at the walls of what appeared to be a huge cavern. There were pillars and shelves and desks. Dust trickled through the air and covered everything in a soft blanket. 

Jones paused as something clattered from under his foot and trickled to a halt a few feet away. 

The camera walked towards it, and Jones's arm could be seen reaching. 

With a swipe of his hand, he knocked the dust aside. ""What..."" he muttered. 

There, grinning at the camera, was a skull. A very distinct skull, with its rounded cranial cavity, dual eye sockets, heart-shaped nasal bones, and mandibles.

He flung it from himself with a sharp cry. Panting heavily, he swung the flashlight in a wide arc. 

Bones were everywhere.

It was the last image broadcasted to the hushed blue and green planet, as Jones's feed ended in a hiss of static. 

His ship never returned.",shortscarystories
"Andy walked for a few hours without much thought. He checked his watch, 9pm. He hadn’t noticed it getting dark. He started heading back in the direction he believed he would find his car, hoping it wouldn’t take him too long to get back. 15 minutes of walking and he stopped. It was quite cold at this point so he got his hat out his pocket before continuing. After he started walking again he noticed a feint *tap, tap, tap* sound, difficult to make out. He ignored it and continued... but the tapping continued. *Tap, tap, tap* it was definitely a sound, not Andy’s imagination. He couldn’t quite make out what the sound was, however. He kept walking. *Tap, tap, tap* there it was again. He turned around and noticed, completely still in the slight distance behind him, a silhouette of an upright rectangular shape. He shook his head and continued walking, it was nothing after all. *Tap, tap, tap* The sound continued. He turned around once more to see the shape, slightly closer than previously. Andy decided he’d had enough. He began walking towards the object to see what it was. He got within about 10 meters to see that it was, indeed, rectangular. It was made of wood, finely crafted. It almost seemed to unmistakenly take the form of a coffin. Bizarre. Now he turned and ran. *Tap, tap, tap.* He turned and, yes, the coffin was still no further away. He decided to keep his eyes and torch fixated on the coffin and backed away slowly. The coffin remained still. He moved back, continuing to stare at the coffin, into a normal pace. Then, something extraordinary happened. The coffin moved. It swung, seemingly without support from anything, onto one of its corners, tilted forward then switched to the next corner, almost like taking steps. The coffin was walking towards Andy. He turned and ran, hearing the constant tap, tap, tap of wood against mud behind him. Up ahead he saw a building. It was an old, recently abandoned farmhouse. He turned around, the coffin still in pursuit. He ran to the building, flung open the door then closed it behind him. There, a coffin can’t open a door, surely? Then the handle began to twist, the door began to slowly creak towards him and, to his horror, the coffin entered the building. He leapt up and lunged up the nearby staircase. Coffins can’t climb stairs! But, to his worst fears, that is precisely what happened. *Tap, tap, tap.* He ran into the nearest room, locked the door behind him and took in his surroundings. He was in a bathroom. *Bang, bang, bang* the bathroom door shook. He opened the medicine cabinet, grabbing the first bottle he could find just as the door came off its hinges *crash*. Andy hurled the bottle he had, cough medicine... and the coffin stopped.",shortscarystories
"It all started with the Pull. One moment, New York was full of people, hurrying to work and talking on their cell phones. And the next? 

Poof. 

All of the noise stopped. The streets were empty. Everyone had just vanished into thin air. 

Without anyone to pilot them, airplanes fell from the sky. Cars and trains and buses crashed. Fires started in buildings and parks. With the fire department unavailable, and the nation in absolute confusion, they’d continue to burn through most of New York City. 

It’d take days to put them out. 

Of course, after that was taken care of, questions were asked. The government would launch an investigation into the event, an attempt at finding the 19.49 million victims. Nothing ever became of it though. The Pull left no bodies. No evidence. 

Families mourned. Speculation ran rampant on the news. Conspiracy theories were passed around. But eventually, the world started to move on. 

Then, the Push. An opposing force. Or maybe, a complementary one. It doesn’t really matter what it was. 

Body parts appeared out of nowhere. 

Heads were found throughout the Oregon wilderness, impaled on tree limbs and floating down streams. 

Toes and fingers were expelled from hollowed-out trunks and holes. 

Flowers bloomed, opening up to reveal human eyes. 

Questions were asked, sure, but nobody had any answers.",shortscarystories
"Today was supposed to be a momentous day for Harry. Every year since he was seven he’d go to this one Oriental restaurant for his birthday, and indulge in its rich, exotic foods (and since he turned twenty-one, its drink as well). 

The cuisine was amazing, but the company was always better. First it was his parents. Then it was his friends. Then, his girlfriend. 

This year, however, only the cuisine would be the highlight of his day. Today, on his twenty-seventh, there was no one.

Not that anyone could’ve blamed them. The last several months had been a downward spiral for him, of death in the family, of fights and breakups and losings. The Harry of his twenty-sixth was dead. In his place was someone dirty and angry and lost.

Regardless, he still found himself gravitating towards the Oriental restaurant today. An excuse to leave his overdue rent and vacuous funds behind him for a night, and try to reap that spark he once knew and loved.

Now there certainly was a warmth spreading through him, though probably thanks to the half bottle of sake he’d just downed. As the waitress came over to take his order, he struggled with his menu. His fingertips felt like butter. Black fog crept around the edges of his vision. But somehow, he managed to focus on an entrée and garble it to her.

“And make it snappy, my jade darling,” he slurred with a chuckle. 

He ignored the glares of his fellow patrons as he slumped in his seat, trying to recall exactly what he had ordered. *San-nagasaki? Sa-naja? Ah, whatever.*

By the time the waitress delivered his food (before departing rather briskly), the entire bottle had been drained, and Harry wasted no time spearing a huge gob onto his fork and shoving it into his mouth. He grimaced at the taste, salty and rubbery, screaming with sesame oil. But hey, food was food. Anything to soak up the drink in his gullet. 

At first the sensation was a mere annoyance, like soft gum in the back of his throat. But as he tried to dislodge it with a cough, the thing seemed to expand…and latch on.

Harry pounded at his neck and gagged, staggering to his feet…he could feel them moving and suctioning, hundreds of little suckers trailing into his stomach, up his nose, slithering between his teeth. There was the minute cutting of a beak, and his mouth flooded with the taste of ferrous blood and sesame, which dribbled from his lips in a coagulated mass…

The lights went out and he fell to the ground, throttling himself, hacking up bits of entrails, writhing in drunken panic, as the thing in his throat was EATING ME, OH GOD ITS EATING ME HELP ME ITS EATING ME –

And Harry, age twenty-seven, spasmed and fell still on the linoleum floor. 

From the crowd of onlookers, the waitress shouted back towards the kitchen: “That’s it – we’re taking *san-nakji* off the menu.”",shortscarystories
"Researcher's log, week 237

All this time, I never could have imagined what it would be like when we finally bolted the last strut in place, ran the last tests, and now stand ready to activate the machine. Everything has led up to exactly this moment in time when, ironically, humanity is ready to take its first steps backwards. Time travel is no longer simply a possibility, but now a reality. 

Almost 5 years ago, a lone scientist discovered a way to send radio transmissions back in time by reversing time outside of a small area of contained space. The prototype was small enough to be powered by a nuclear battery, but in order to make the contaiment field bigger, you need exponentially more power. 

That's where humanity's second greatest scientific breakthtough comes into play. 7 massive fusion reactors, one powering each continent using ordinary seawater, were completed in 2043. We only need to siphon a small portion of the North American reactor's total power output to make this work. 

Today we are finally ready to try sending ordinary matter back. We'll be starting with just a basketball first, then I think we can try mice next. For anti-paradox reasons, the recieving coordinates are set to the room next door, and they've been instructed not to talk to us until our end of the tests have been fully completed. As the lead researcher, I am honored to be the one to press the ""big red button"", that the engineering team installed with tongue in cheek. The countdown starts, we run a green-light check, and finally...

" *Ring...Ring...Ring*

Sarah sat up in bed, her heart racing. Her eyes scanned across the blackness that was her bedroom. She didn’t know the time, but knew that it was far too late for the call to be good news. She grabbed the handset from the base and answered the call, silencing the ringer. 

“Hello?” she said. She was only met with the sound of someone breathing. 

“Hello?” Sarah repeated, beginning to become agitated.

“Hello, Sarah,” a man’s voice replied. 

“Who is this?” she asked.

“It doesn't matter who I am,” he replied. His voice was calm, almost soothing as he spoke. Sarah felt her pulse start to race and her breath began to quiver.

“What do you want?” she demanded, trying not to let on how terrified she was.

""I would love to hang out, but I know it's much too late for that,"" he replied, in a tone akin to mocking. ""But I will settle for just a little chat."" Sarah scanned the room, looking for her cellphone. She cursed under her breath, as she realized she left it charging downstairs

""Why do you want to talk to me?"" She asked.

""I've admired you from afar for some time now, Sarah,"" he said. Something about how he said her name made her blood curdle. “I wanted to introduce myself to you, but…”

“Now listen here!” Sarah yelled, surprising herself a little by her reaction. “I don’t know how you got this number, or how you thought that this would go, but calling me in the middle of the night is just creepy and gross. If you call me again, I will call the police!”

“Sarah…” the man said calmly. “That would be in neither of our best interests.” 

“What the hell are you talking about?” Sarah hissed, her heart pounding.

“Well, if the police were to be called, then we wouldn’t get to have a magical night together,” he replied. “There wouldn’t be time to truly enjoy the little moments that we would be able to otherwise share.”

“That’s it, I’m calling the police,” Sarah said. She pulled the receiver from her ear and went to end the call, when she noticed the caller I.D.

*Headset #2 is calling.*

"My grandfather Gerald (who since passed) was a wonderful man who used to love telling stories about his childhood.

Although it was easy for him to talk about his past there was one topic that was taboo and that was the time he served in World War II.

Now, it was during one of our family get-togethers that he seemed distant.

Worried, I began to pesteri him for answers until finally he broke down and said, *""She's coming for me...""*

Confused I asked, *""Who's coming for you?""* 

He paused for a moment and said, *""She is,""* then began telling me a story...

______________________________________________________________________________

*You know that I served in World War II, right?*

*Well, when I was nineteen I was shipped off to Germany.*

*For a guy like me, who grew up in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania it was difficult to adjust to a foreign country.*

*To make matters worse, I, along with hundreds of other men were forced into trenches for long periods of time.*

*Although I wasn't a particularly religious person, I would oftentimes find myself praying to God for the war to just end.*

*Anyway, on one particular night, a strange woman wearing one of those old nurses' uniforms appeared out of nowhere.*

*Puzzled, I wonder how this woman even got here (the nearest village was five-miles away) but before I could ask she'd already entered the trenches.*

*We shouted at her to stop but she wouldn't listen and continued to walk without any care in the world.*

*Now, as the other men approached her they began to fall one man after another until finally, she reached me.*

*As we stood there face to face, she began to change like something right out of a nightmare.*

*Then without warning, she reached out her now withered hand and touched my shoulders leaving a searing pain like that I never felt before. Afterward, she lifted her now normal hand off my shoulder and vanished into thin air.*

*I sat there for hours crying and thanking God for sparing my life but realized at that moment, she might come back...*

*So I concocted a plan.*

*After building up some courage (the liquid kind of course), I grabbed a weapon and shot myself in the leg.*

*They found me two hours later unconscious but alive.*

*Eventually, I was sent back to Pennsylvania where I met and married your grandma Marge...*

*Lately though, I've been seeing this woman in my dreams and now, after all these years she's finally coming back for me...*

" I do like to admire art from time to time but I wouldn't call myself a fanatic. I don't really know what type of art I like, but if there is something that appeals to me then I will admire it. A couple of months ago I was walking along a beautiful field residing over a beach. It was a beautiful day and I could see someone painting the field and the beach from a distance. He had all of the necessary equipment to paint and as I was walking along the field I saw a yellow sign stretched out onto the field. It was a yellow sign mainly used by cleaners to warn people that the floor is slippery, but the sign read something completely unpredicted.

It read 'beware the area you are about to walk on is what the artist is painting. If you walk onto it you will be part of the painting'

I took no notice of it and carried on walking until I couldn't move anymore. My body was fixed in the shape of walking because I was in the area that the painter was painting, I was literally part of the painting. For a whole hour my body was fixed into the shape of walking and when the stranger in the distance finished painting I was able to move again.

I couldn't believe what had happened and I just jogged off and the painter was just staring at me. The second time I saw him was when I had accidently walked onto an area the painter was painting as I had missed the signs. He was painting some abandon homes in some abandon area, I like to go for long walks in many areas. My body became stuck still as I was part of the painting now.

For a whole hour I was stuck in the walking position and when I could finally move again the painter came up to me and introduced himself, his name was freddy. After a quick awkward greeting I walked away. Then for many months I hadn't seen this strange painter and I thought he had gone away. Then a couple of weeks ago I saw someone being beat up and they left him for dead. I tried to run up to him but on the way to help him, I couldn't move my body anymore because I stumbled in the area where the painter was painting. I had missed the signs once again and as the guy was dying on the floor my body was stuck in the running position. I couldn't move but I could shout out ""stop painting!""

When freddy stopped painting, the guy had unfortunately died.",shortscarystories

I swear she is.

At least I think it is.

I remember her so vividly sometimes, I could almost pretend she's not. And those are the moments were my decisions on the matter come into question.

But she's dead.

I can see the blue and black bruises and and down her body, the missing patches of skin. The blood dripping from her mouth, stuck agape by her broken jaw. Darla Ferguson hiked alone. Darla Ferguson fell. And died.

She must have been dead. I saw her body, identified her. I swear that much.

*Can I believe you?*

No.

I swear, her body was there. And it was lifeless. But once in a while, I saw her head move, eyes blink. What did they even look like?

*Uh no.*

She didn't die hiking. But she's dead, that's all you have to worry about. Her missing posters are gone...

*She never had any.*

But I was the only person who thought about her anyway.And I miss her. They took her from me.

*""Miss Ferguson? Marla?""*

*""Yes, Dr. Gray?""*

*""How are you doing Marla?""*

*""Fine.""*

*""How are your pills? Any more hallucinations?""*

*""No.""*

"This time, the sleep paralysis episode was really, really different, and now I’m on the verge of insanity now...

So I had sleep paralysis once again, and this time it was very strange. Now before we get too deep, my grandfather is 86 years old with dementia that is worsening by the months, maybe even by weeks. Now, I have been getting sleep paralysis once roughly around a month and a half, now I had recently had one episode a week after the last, which was very unusual. I usually fall asleep watching Youtube on my PS4 on my tv the is at the foot of the bed, in my room, in the basement. I usually fall asleep watching MxR Plays, NExpo, SomeOrdinaryGamers, or something else with the volume up to 12, which is actually pretty loud. This time that I had the episode, the week after the last episode, I fell asleep watching MxR Plays, but there was absolutely no volume... at all... and all I heard was gibberish coming from the other side of my room, which has a black curtain separating the room in half, and this gibberish was coming from the other side of the curtain. This gibberish sounded oddly familiar, like that of a family member that lives in the house, directly above my room. Ever since I was young, I have been desensitized by horror movies, nothing actually scares me anymore, but this was different, because this gibberish not only sounded like a very dear family member that I hold close to, but it also wasn’t english, and sounded more possessed-like, like a demon. As soon I close my eyes because I was soo fucking unnerved, the talking stops. I open my eyes to my grandfather standing at the foot of my bed, and yes, the grandfather that has almost severe dementia, not saying a word. As I close my eyes again, he disappears out of my room like a ghost. When I “wake up” from this episode, I notice that my house is in chaos, as my grandfather cannot be found anywhere, and this was a very big problem, because since the dementia got really bad, he would be talking to people who weren’t there, his “children”, his “friends”, and the “others”. I truly did not know what happened and yet, the look I saw on his face was the face of a husk, till this day I wonder if it was a dream, or he was gone the whole time.",shortscarystories
" 

From the Federal Government of the United States,

We are pleased to inform you that very soon a rare event will occur in/near your current area. A so called Double Sunrise is about to happen and we are all very excited for it. This is an event that, like a solar eclipse, is very rare. According to calculations a Double Sunrise only appears every 2 milenia.

&amp;#x200B;

A Double Sunrise is an illusionaire effect that makes it look like there are momentarily two suns in the sky instead of one. It's important to realise that the second sun is not real but an illusion that happens because various gravity fields in our solar system line up perfectly which causes the light from the sun to loop a second time, thus creating a so called: Double Sunrise.

&amp;#x200B;

However notice that looking directly at the sun or the second sun will be very damaging to your eyes and is not advised. Therefore we included a special pair of sunglasses in this letter that make sure your eyes won't be damaged when you are witnessing the Double Sunrise.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the precise nature of gravity fields, we can not exactly predict when theDouble Sunrise will happen but with this letter we hope we have provided you with enough information and equipment to enjoy such an amazing event.

&amp;#x200B;

We wish you the best of luck with the soon to come Double SunRise.

&amp;#x200B;

Signed by: 

Emelia Hardless, Head of the Department for safety and Security.

Some call it  cruel, others call it an act of mercy. 

No matter how you put it, Emelia truly believed that this was for the best.

Now World War 3 was on the Horizon it was important that the people did not panic and stayed at ease.

Ofcourse there was no Double Sunrise.

The ""special"" sunglasses were just regular glasses.

"I'm alone.

I don't have any friends. I don't have any family members who care about me. I don't even have a love interest. I'm just a loner; that one person you see walk past you that you just ignore, because you know you'll never see them again.

Everyone in my life is like that. Everybody ignores me. And I am alone.

I try to make friends, but none of them like me. They ignore me. They tell me to go away. They insult me. And it hurts. It hurts knowing nobody likes me. And I'm alone, forever.

I try to be kind to people. I hold doors for others. I give money to homeless people. One time, I even walked an old lady home when she claimed to be lost. She looked so frail and innocent, and I knew she was alone, too.

So I helped her.

She looked at me, smiled, and said that she would give me one wish. I didn't know what she meant. Maybe she was so alone that she had started to go crazy. 

But under my breath, I simply said ""I wish I wasn't alone"" and left.

It first came when I was in bed. I woke up to the window opening, and it climbed into my room. Its eyes glowed white, and they were focused on me. 

It stood there all night. I know because I did not sleep.

And it followed me. Every time I turned around, I would see it staring back at me, its hideous mouth smiling a wide grin full of razor sharp fangs. It followed me everywhere. Nobody else saw it. It followed me *everywhere.* I wanted people to like me, but not like this. I wanted someone I could truly talk to, not a demon that watches everything I do.

I want to get rid of it. I want to be alone again. But I can't. It just keeps following me.

And it followed me forever

"He couldn’t believe his luck. I told him you’d dumped me and I wasn’t looking for another relationship. After all, you left more than a crack in my heart, Julian.

You really did.

I sucked his cock in an alley outside the bar; he bent me forward and fucked me from behind. He was surprised but pleased I liked it up the ass — how many girls do, really?

Later I found another one, then another and another and another. Post-Julian me was in bars and clubs, dolled up in my fuck-me boots and red dress — the one you said makes me look like a slut.

I think I like being a slut.

I picked up guys (they thought they did the picking – not really, boys), and I had a dozen dating profiles. Sometimes I fucked three or more men in one night.

I know, hot girls like me don’t normally act like this. I know.

Some thought I was a hooker, but I’m not after money.

When I was with you, I never knew who I was; I knew only the self that was reflected in your eyes. The self that you wanted me to be, Julian, the one you desired. I am that self: I dress up, flirt, suck cock and take it up the ass. Always up the ass.

Just the way you liked it, Julian. Remember?

When I grew bored with hook-ups, I added new excitements. I became the unicorn to bi male couples (ironic, right?). And I was what all men want: the hot single chick in the swinger club absolutely DTF.

I went with Paul. He said he was into group sex blah blah, but when I fucked my way through whole clusters of men, I mean dozens, he got all prissy. He said I was troubled. That I was sick.

He was right, just not in the way he thought.

Oh Julian, you said you loved me; but when you got the diagnosis, you didn't even tell me. You just left without saying goodbye. I only found out when I got sick myself. And hey, I’m a student — I could barely afford the test. The meds I need for the rest of my life?

No way.

I used to say I was lucky to be with you. Well, that’s what those guys say to me now. Vile pigs cheating on their girlfriends probably, infecting them. I hate them, I fucking hate them. Especially when they tell me how lucky they feel.

Lucky I take it up the ass.

Lucky I don’t use condoms.

When I see the filthy lust bubbling in their eyes I think of you, Julian, when they stare at me their eyes are yours, I want to laugh at them, *hahaha*, until the world breaks to pieces.

"The Ouija board was Hannah’s fucking idea.

“Seriously,” she insisted to us, wide-eyed, as we sat in the back of our AP Chemistry class doodling on notebooks and planning sleepover activities for the weekend. “My house is haunted. My grandpa bought it after this guy, Hungry John, died inside. They say his ghost still haunts the place, and if you bring his favorite foods, he’ll appear.”

I was going to ask what, exactly, his appearance would entail, but Hanna-without-an-H beat me to the punch. “Food? Food is boring. What’s his favorite booze?”

“What’s his favorite strain?” Lily, our resident stoner, added.

“What’s his type?” Hanna-without-an-H jeered again. She elbowed Lily in the side, then playfully yoinked one of her copper curls. “You think he’s into redheads?”

“Let’s contact him this weekend and find out,” Hannah whispered conspiratorially.

And then she mentioned the fucking Ouija board, and we agreed to it, and on Saturday night, we lit a candle and summoned Hungry John. “If you see something you like,” Hannah urged in the fervent whisper of a true believer, “please, take it.”

We laid out our offerings of food, vodka taken from Hannah’s parents’ liquor cabinet, and some potent weed — but nothing happened. We waited, and nothing happened. We said goodbye.

Nothing happened.

We didn’t feel like anything mystical had occurred. We felt silly for even trying, sheepish as we drank from the flask we offered so reverently just moments before. We slept soundly.

Until Lily’s shriek startled us awake in the night, cutting off as abruptly as it began. We searched the room for her, then the house, then the neighborhood — then the police got involved, and the search remains active even now.

He did not find peace in foreign lands of the West. He was ridiculed by those with open arms to his refugee plot, but only as manual labor, treated like an imbecile. Told he was only good as a washer, or with a broom.

He did not find peace in freedom. After so long, so much saved, American promise held nothing with their Red hats, saying he didn’t belong in the land of immigrants. 

He did not find peace with “tolerance”. They attacked only, they did not defend; they did not understand Islam, only cared that it angered their opponents.

He did not find peace in partnership. How could he see a woman who reminded him of his poor mother as “manipulating”.....? She taught him English, didn’t that mean she loved him?

There was no peace in drink. He broke Allah’s rule, no better than his father, he thought. More definitely, he broke the law when he hit that child on the road.....

There was no peace in punishment. He was told either a lifetime in prison or the military. “Reform” was not worth the hell of what his skin color, his blood, brought.

All this time, he wondered where his peace was.....especially as he deployed, 1st platoon, K company. A loud man with no consequences was dangerous to peace. Back in his home country, under a different flag. His comrades resented him, called him traitor. Then the bullets silenced their complaints. He shivered in a hole, his rifle no defense. 

He steeled himself. Would now be where he found peace....? His pulled him self up, fired two shots, and was immediately hit by 6. This was it.....he felt little, except the two burning rounds in his shoulder......this was his peace!

......

He woke, the burning remaining.

“You were lucky to live. I’m afraid your vocal chords suffered heavy damage, it’s unlikely you’ll talk again.....but we saved you!” 

The white coats congratulated themselves. His thanks was given in silent screams as he felt the bullet they missed in his shoulder, forever there, his peace never found.",shortscarystories
"When I was sixteen, my parents put a camera on top of my dresser to make sure I wasn’t sneaking out at night. I used to sneak out once a week at least, sometimes more. I would get drunk and high, then sometimes the police would show up and they would get in trouble. 

They had gotten sick and tired of it, so that’s why they installed it. It was nailed down on my dresser, it was quite noticeable. They warned me about it so I didn’t sneak out of jerk off in front of it. My dresser is pointing my bed but on the other side of the room.

I was such a fucking stubborn child I removed it and hid it one night so I could go to a party. I knew I would get in trouble, but it was going to be one of the biggest parties in all history of high school. When the policed showed up, I had gotten grounded for months and went through the torture of listen to them making a long ass speech on why it is bad. 

They installed it again on my ceiling and I removed it again just to be an asshole. My parents phone was connected to the camera, but they were gone so I held a party at my house. I knew I would get into a lot of trouble, but my parents never hit me. I looked at my phone and I had text messages from them. 

I read them and they sounded furious, it had cuss words in them. That was big, because my parents are against cuss words. I just put my phone in my dresser and partied. After the party I fell asleep. I cleaned the house along with my boyfriend. We cleaned for hours, my boyfriend is so weird, he likes cleaning, but I guess that kinda fits the stereotypical gay.

I then wanted to check my phone, I was preparing myself of what I was about to read. But my parents texts ended at 11:56 sharp. They were angry texts but it ended there. The newest message was from my aunt, she said she was going to come over. That was a few minutes ago. 

She came over after an hour, she lives quite a bit away. She was crying, breaking down. It turned out that my parents had died in a car crash. They never figured this out, because their phones were too cracked, but I was the cause of the death. They said it was reported just before midnight. They were trying to get to me, and didn’t pay attention enough to the road.

I blamed myself for years, fell into depression. I did self harm, I almost scared away my boyfriend. My boyfriend stayed with me a couple nights after my parents death. But on the third night I said I was fine. But when I woke up that morning, the camera was set up again.",shortscarystories
"There is hardly any point in History that is left untouched by time tourists at this point. They have littered the tombs of pharaohs, graffited over the walls of the Caves of Sullawesi and took selfies with the Khan. It is a well know fact that, at this point, nobody in the Titanic was an original passenger, just a bunch of time vultures trying to see the tragedy in first hand.

There were none here. I was the only time traveller at the door of Baby Hitler's childhood home. I knocked, half expecting to be taken down by throves of timecops before my knuckles connected to the door, but that didn't happen either. Had I been lucky enough to get there before any of the multiple time agencies tracked me down?

The couple recognized me as an old friend, courtesy of a cheap perception circuit I had brought with me, which was enough to project an era-appropriate suit and even a ridiculous hat. They called me Hans something and urged me to see The Baby, such as proud parents will do. He was sleeping, of course, and could I watch over his crib while they they popped off to the shop and bought a few beers for dinner? Of course I could.

The Little Thing that lied on a small and comfortable mattress opened its eyes, as if in shock when I entered the room, but I moved quick and pressed a pillow over its not yet mustached face, and that was that.

I sat on a chair next to Baby Hitler's crib and waited for the paradox to engulf the timeline, or for the ripples in History to completely erase the existence of everything I've had ever known, but nothing happened. Instead of collapsing on itself, time went on, and I yawned at the anti-climax of it all and dozed off.

I woke up in shock, lying on a small and comfortable mattress. A man, dressed in era-appropriate suit and ridiculous hat entered the room.  Without giving me any time to think, he pressed a pillow over my face, and that was that.",shortscarystories
"He had just turned 18. His whole life ahead of him. He was an athlete of sorts, large and muscular and he was already known for rugby

It was a cold night then, he had gone with his friends for a night in the pub, but as it got late some of his friends got lost in the crowd and he ended up alone.

He checked his phone. 1%. This could never end well. As he left the pub at maybe 3, he needed to find a way to charge it. It was then that he saw it, a charging booth across the street. Perfect.

He began to approach but suddenly thought, how odd of a location. It was on the corner of an alley and didn’t seem associated to any of the nearby shops. He approached hesitantly , wary of any danger. But none seemed to be present.

He looked down the machine and saw a small book to mark usage. Strange. It said that it had been used at least 10 time’s this hour. He suddenly felt his gut cry out as if scared by the box in front of him. 

He shunned it away and plugged in his phone aware of how stupid he was to be scared of it. It was a box nothing more. Less than half his size and probably weighed even less than that.

But as the cable connected the machine seemed to grow and it tore him apart for food.",shortscarystories

"The hands and heads had been removed from the bodies. They were taken at once to mortuaries across the country, but they never stayed there.

Several coroners took leaves of absence after having performed the strangest postmortems known to medical science. The bodies weren’t dead. Almost total blood loss from the radial, ulnar and carotid arteries. The centre of the nervous system— the brain— its stem and attaching vertebrae totally missing. And yet the hearts were still beating. The other internal organs not only functioned but in most instances were found to be in peak condition. The bodies were still capable of achieving breath, urination, defecation, full sexual arousal and ejaculation and responded mildly to a range of external stimuli.

\*\*\*

That’s where I come in. I’m a consultant neurologist and neurosurgeon who, up until the headless bodies began to spring up like daisies, specialised in traumatic brain injury. I’ve successfully treated patients for whom injuries or congenital factors had reduced their brain volume to 70-per-cent. I and my team were called upon by the government to examine the subjects. Our mission statement was both the most simple and the most bedevilling ever to be presented to a party of physicians: to discover what keeps a decapitated corpse alive.

\*\*\*

Our breakthrough came the day we got to talk to one of our patients.

Just outside Wikieup, Arizona, a team in HazMat suits found a head under a patch of creosote. DNA tests identified it as belonging to one of our bodies.

The head was packed in ice and rushed to our facility via organ transit.

By that time every test we’d done had come up blank. The bodies were alive the way vegetables or sea sponges are alive but no evidence we had gathered offered us a reason why.

When it arrived we’d already decided to reattach the head to its body, and so we did.

Within minutes of the tissues being reunited the temporal muscles in the until then inanimate head had begun to move, giving the impression of chewing. The tongue also moved inside the mouth.

Within a half hour the eyes had opened.

By the thirsty-first minute the thing was screaming.

The noises it made hardly registered as human at first but after some time of listening to the terrible sound we made out what it was saying.

It was begging us. It was begging us to cut off its head.

I asked it why. Why did it want that!? I shouted the question.

It went quiet and I moved closer.

It whispered the answer in my ear.

\*\*\*

Now I’m three floors up in the block of medical buildings where we’d been headquartered.

The emergency services have laid an inflatable matting out on the concrete down below. They’re yelling up at me not to jump.

I’ve already cut off my hands.

I’ve attached a piece of razor wire to the radiator behind me. I’m making a noose out of the other end.",shortscarystories
"The man walked into the room with a presences never before seen. He had the power of a country at the tip of his finger, just like those before him, but he, unlike the others, was not afraid to use it.

""So what's the situation?"", he asked. Silence followed.

""Tell me."", he continued.

""Well, sir."", someone answered. ""We don't know if an attack is imminent. It's probable, but not certain.""

""An offensive strategy is the best solution, sir!"", a trusted advisor said.

""We do not want to start anything. We should let them make the first move."", someone next to him said.

""And what? Let them hit us first? It will be to late by then!"" a woman screamed from far away.

""It's better to wait!"", yelled another.

""If we wait we'll all die..."", muttered a fellow citizen angrily.

Many more joined the debate with foul language and strong voices, but as if he had the power of God himself, the man raised his hand into the air and silenced the room without a word.

""In times as these, decisions must be made with great preparation and discipline. I didn't sleep well last night, so instead I pondered this situation, so consequently I have done my preparation. Now, I only need discipline. But since an offense towards our nation is imminent, discipline must wait until later. Children will die. Families will suffer, unless we act now. Make it happen.""

When the man had finished speaking, you could hear nothing but the wind outside. No one said a word.

The following hour the people of the great nation could watch hundreds of soaring lights disappear over the horizon. When they all had vanished the sky turned from blue to bright orange and white, like a second sun had been lit behind the curve.

When the light settled and the flashes dimmed, the people began to calm. But in that moment of peace, the same soaring lights as before became visible again, but this time they were headed the other way.",shortscarystories
"Sloan, and Silas were twin brothers. Raised in a rural lake town, and into a group of ""preppers"" that made the community of Taylor's Landing a compound consisting of twelve families all living the same life style. By the age of eight, the twin boys could trap, hunt, track, shoot and basically survive even in the harsh Oklahoma wilderness. When hey turned sixteen, however, the boys had began to go astray....tending to disappear for days on end only to return with strange wounds, and blood sodden. Silas was paying his uncle Willis a visit, and happened to catch a deputy with the Haymore County Sheriff as he was leaving....which didn't end well....Willis barley heard a commotion, and thought nothing much of it, until his nephew entered the home with the deputy's hat on, and his police belt slung over his shoulder. ""Well, there's a new Sheriff in these parts, Unk."" Silas said in almost a whisper, and as he did sliding his 12 inch KA-BAR combat knife into his uncle's chest. Directly into his heart. The large man collapsed to the ground with a thunderous thud, but just like a tree in the forest, there was no one else around to hear it. Meanwhile, Sloan was carrying out his part of their mission, visiting the ""Ranch"" where the charm school Mrs. Golden ran was operating. He knew that only one man was around, and it was Tad, a ranchhand who was a moderate threat. ""Brought ya some of Jimmy's fire water, Tadpole!"" Sloan called from the seat of his pickup as he pulled in to the Ranch. Tad came a runnin, and grabbed the Mason jar full of moonshine and waved the boy in, ""Mama Golden is in town gettin her hair did, but Joy and Mira are back'ere."" Tad said, bumbling off toward his shack having a few swills on his way. Sloan opened the door to the ladies dressing room, and both girls turned white as a sheet. There Sloan stood with a Machete in one hand, and the head of Mama Golden's poodle, Pixie, in the other. ""Their screams echoed through the small valley the Ranch was nestled in, but no one heard.....poor Tad was face down in his own vomit having been poisoned. A radio cracked in Sloan's back pocket, ""Slo, got the armory keys from Unc. Eliminated him to be sure he wasn't a problem later on. Status on the Brides? Over."" Sloan smiled as he finished loading the now tied up girls into his truck bed, and answered his walkie. ""Brides secure, planting device for Mama Golden's return now, over."" He put the radio away, and removed the brick of C4 he and his brother had made to perfection the night before. He rigged it to go off when Mama G would enter the dining area with her other two gaurds some time in the next hour. He then hopped in his truck and headed toward the spot he and his brother had chosen to begin their empire, which was a cabin deep in the woods they'd made as younger kids. They had a place they parked their trucks, and covered them with military grade Gillie covers, and hiked the remaining two miles into the deep Oklahoma back country to their lair.

"Several miles away at the Artists' Village, which was a group of rustic and ramshackle wooden rental buildings located at the Rance estuary between Saint-Malo and Dinan, the property manager Clifford Rochett was removing some wallpaper…and having very little success at it. For beneath the first layer of wallpaper was yet another thick layer of wallpaper. Beneath that layer, another, this one painted over with a thick yellow emulsion, making it almost immune to the effects of the industrial-strength steamer Clifford had borrowed from his expatriate brother-in-law. After about an hour, Clifford was forced to give up entirely on modern British technology and resort to sheer brute force and a sturdy craft knife.

When his  wife Marie appeared holding two tall glasses of iced tea and said, ""What's that?"" Clifford stepped back and was about to say, ""No doubt another damn layer of that disgusting puke-yellow wallpaper.""

Instead, he found himself saying with a baffled shrug, ""Well, I don't know. It’s old, that’s for sure.""

""Looks like some kind of mural,"" said Marie, being a former artist herself. “Maybe an oil portrait of some kind.” She placed the iced teas on Clifford’s workbench, stepped toward the wall and wrenched away a broadsheet of wallpaper that resembled the thick, yellow, leathery hide of some long-dead elephantine creature.

Immediately, a putrid stench pervaled the air of the cramped living room.  Coughing, the Rochetts reeled back, raising their hands to their faces, resisting the urge to gag.

""What the hell is that?"" said Clifford, rubbing his watering eyes.  Then, picking up an electric torch, he stepped forward as he shone it on the bloated fetid thing that was contorted fetus-like into the tattered vertical gap.   His voice dropped to a whisper as he staggered back a second time, ""Hey, isn’t that the missing tenant?  That notorious graffiti vandal/vlogger--Elio... such-and-such?”

Meanwhile, next door…

""What’s that?"" said twelve-year-old James.

His classmate Paul just shrugged as he poked at the small pale thing with the stick of bamboo he'd stolen from Don Jones's garden when everything had been normal.

""I don't think it's anything,"" Veronica muttered, nudging it with her pink Wellingtons. ""I mean, it doesn't look like anything. Not really.""

""Well, it’s gotta be something,"" said James.  He shot a side glance at  Veronica and pursed his lips thoughtfully. ""It can't be anything. Can it?""

""Whatever it is,"" said Paul, still staring, still poking, ""I think it's bleeding.""

"Ron felt he was about to hit that runner's high when he heard a 'splat!' behind him.

&amp;#x200B;

He slowed down to a stop and turned around, taking out his earbuds. On the sidewalk behind him, he saw what first seemed like a wet spot. Then, he realized there was a broken eggshell to accompany it.

&amp;#x200B;

Why would someone throw eggs at him? Ron wondered as he turned his gaze upwards to see who threw it. Above the line of shops at street level, there looked to be several apartments on the second story. In one, Ron could see a small open window with its cream-colored drapes fluttering in the wind. Suddenly moved to anger, Ron yelled,

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey! I know you threw that! Why are you throwing eggs at me!?""

&amp;#x200B;

Another egg flew out of the window, this time landing closer.

&amp;#x200B;

""Cut it out, you're gonna hit someone! If you don't stop, I'll call the police!""

&amp;#x200B;

Other pedestrians on the sidewalk started moving away from Ron, who was growing angrier by the minute. A young woman passing by tapped Ron on the shoulder. Still enraged, Ron glared down at her. She tentatively told him,

&amp;#x200B;

""I think it's just a kid honey. Best to forget about it and move on."" As she was speaking, yet another egg flew out of the window and smashed into Ron's head.

&amp;#x200B;

""That's it! Whichever little shit is doing this is gonna have my foot up his ass when I get up there!""

&amp;#x200B;

Without thinking, Ron stormed over and pressed the button to buzz him into the apartment stairwell. Throwing the door open, Ron didn't stop to think why he was let in. Rushing up the stairs, Ron was soon pounding on the door to the apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

""I swear to god, I'll break down this fucking door if you don't open it!""

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, a lock clicked and the door creaked open. Unfortunately for Ron, he was still too furious to notice any details of the space before he charged in. If he had, he would've seen the plastic sheeting covering an interior devoid of any furniture besides a long metal table in the center of the main room and the tray of sharp instruments beside it. He might've even seen the rust-colored stains on the bottom of the door.

"Ever hear the fable of the frog being boiled alive because the water was heated too slowly for it to realize it was in danger?

That’s a great analogy to my situation; by the time I realized I was living with a speed freak psychopath, it was too late.

The rent in my city is prohibitively expensive and Ted’s income keeps us from being homeless again. At least that’s the justification I used as things started to get progressively worse.

Waking was often chilling. It started with messes, holes in the walls, sometimes it looked like a riot occurred in our apartment.

The first time I woke up to blood mixed in the mess it freaked me out. I had caught glimpses of his browser history and I knew he was into kinky things; I think I used that to rationalize it.

One day I woke to more blood than I ever observed and a missing shower curtain.

I know I should have called the police, but I felt I was in too deep. 

Slowly, just like the frog, I rationalized becoming an accessory to whatever Ted had done. 

I finally got up enough nerve to talk to my Doctor about it. Not all of it, I was after all potentially an accomplice at this point.

She recommended disposing of any kind of stimulants in the apartment, hoping to tame his “antics” as I covertly portrayed them.

She also prescribed me medication to keep my nerves calm. 

I didn’t tell her that I had other plans for it. I crushed them and put them in an energy drink bottle.

This worked like magic. Ted must have just thought he had burned out, I never saw him do it, but half the drink would be gone and no mess in the morning.

Things settled enough that I was able to start dating again. 

I met Sarah online and we quickly hit it off. She was not only beautiful, but understanding and sweet.

When she asked about Ted, I would tell her that he’s a recluse and doesn’t like to meet new people.

She spent the night last night for the first time and things had been phenomenal. 

She gave me one of her Dad’s Viagra to spice things up.  

It was the most amazing experience of my entire life!

I awake and my bliss quickly turns into horror as I notice the blood smears on the floor leading towards the bathroom. 

I look in vain for her, but she’s nowhere to be found… Did Ted come in after we slept?

The shower curtain is missing... I collapse to the floor sobbing, thinking back on what could have gone wrong.

I double checked the house… I had disposed of all the stimulants.

Why would Ted do this? 

I couldn’t talk to the Doctor this time; I must handle it on my own. 

The water must be boiling now…

"The sun rose and illuminated the waking beach: a pair of seagulls taking flight, crabs skittering to the water, Jerold Green bashing another man’s head in with a rock. An abrupt and violent end to a friendship that spanned twenty years.

Jerold sat up over the lifeless body of his old buddy, breathing heavy, staring at the unrecognizable face. He dropped the rock and dove into the sand, sweeping the spot where the fight began.

“Where is it? Where the hell is it?”

Jerold gasped, picked up a tiny leather pouch, and dusted the sand from its crevices. He peered inside and smiled brighter than he had at any Christmas gift as a kid. 

The sky was blue by time Jerold finished pulling the body into the tall grass and walked up the sandy trail to the access road.  A woman stood on a hill that overlooked the beach entrance. She wore a long white dress and her fiery red hair blew in the steady sea breeze. Jerold would have described her face as perfection, but that was a word he now reserved for the contents of the pouch. So he scowled. 

“She can’t have it!”

Jerold walked in the opposite direction towards his hotel.

——————-

The Uber pulled into the circle entrance of the hotel, and Jerold climbed in hugging his backpack. They passed few other cars on the road to the bus station. The driver was chipper, but Jerold focused on the passing shrubbery, avoided eye contact, and grunted in response to the driver’s small talk.

A woman stood at a four way stop, surrounded by nothing but road and tall grass for miles.  Her red hair rested over a flowing white dress.

“Odd place for a stroll,” the driver said.

“Oh god, it’s her again.” Jerold cracked the window. “What? It’s mine now!”

“Yes it is, and have you ever owned anything so — perfect?” 

The woman leaned towards the car. She smiled, her face calm, ageless, and as vibrant as her blazing hair.

“Be careful Jerold. It’s beauty sings! The song  captivates, even when hidden.”

Jerold turned. The driver stared in the rear view mirror at the backpack that sat in Jerold’s lap.

“There’s something about your bag — may I see what’s in it?” asked the driver.

Jerold frowned. He opened the door. “Don’t be weird. I’ll walk from here.”

Nolan Covington, the Uber driver, had a reputation of being a nice guy, maybe even a pushover, but once Jerold walked behind the car, he shifted into reverse, and pressed the gas pedal to the floor.

Nolan searched for other cars as he walked to Jerold’s limp body, rummaged through the backpack, and retrieved a small leather pouch. His eyes widened as he peeked inside the top.

“It called to you, didn’t it?” 

Nolan shot his glance towards the red-headed woman, narrowing his eyes.

“Yeah, and it’s mine now!”

Nolan sped away while the woman stood in silent meditation.

"They say a monster lives in the woods.

After a third mangled body was discovered by a group of hunters, police started to suspect foul play was involved. In the last month alone, two other corpses had been found, both with similar -if not identical- lacerations across the thorax. Almost as if a grenade had detonated from within their rib cage, driving everything out. It was the coroners professional opinion that no animal he knew of could have produced such injuries, for not even bears were known to be this vile or cruel. This information was kept from the public by local authorities, fearing that hunters might take vengeance upon the wildlife.

It wasn’t until the first child went missing that people started demanding answers to their concerns. The fact that the child’s younger brother had returned home unharmed, and with vivid descriptions of what took his sibling, only added more uneasiness to the whole ordeal. And fear. Fear at what the child had seen -or what he thought he might've seen, some argued. For yes, he was only a child, with the imagination and creativity of one. But yet, something had undoubtedly snatched his brother on their way home, and whatever it was, he had caught a glimpse of it.

"I’ve always had problems falling asleep. I could be exhausted to the bone, yet some nights I’d just lie in bed staring at the ceiling fan for hours. I could never get comfortable enough... hydrated enough... there’d always be something tying me to consciousness by a thread. And of course, the more you think about how you can’t get to sleep, the harder it becomes. 

What I wouldn’t give for my bed right now, though. My eyes hurt from hanging open. I’d become expert at closing them for just a few moments, and then opening them just soon enough for my captors not to throw a bullet into my leg. This was sleep deprivation torture. My reward for joining the army. My prize for being captured.

Chains gripped my wrists and ankles, just like the chambers back in Uncle Sam’s beach house. There was no way I could feel anything close to hypocrisy, though. I only alternated between a deep, primordial rage and sorrow- like a hungry dog. Torture.

I was rescued just before I was about to start begging for death. People I knew and trusted pulled me into a helicopter and wrapped me in a thick wool blanket. I couldn’t speak to thank them, but my gratitude was the same. Like coming home to Mom and Dad on Christmas Day, I was free and back in God’s arms.

Immediately I began re-evaluating my future as waves of elation silently passed over me. I had resigned myself to death, but now, I could get married. I could have a kid. I could watch them grow up, and have kids of their own. I could see the world on my own terms. I could lie on a beach in the Virgin Islands.

I overheard the medic talking to my first lieutenant as we left the helicopter. “You got him just in time. One more night of no sleep would’ve killed him.”

I was quickly shuffled into a room on the base with a twin cot and sheet stuffed in the corner.

“C-can I call my mom?” I stammered.

“Let’s do it tomorrow morning,” the medic told me. “You need some rest.”

I obliged, pulling myself onto the bed and pulling the sheet over my body. Closing my eyes immediately sent tears to my eyes, shutting them so tight I couldn’t even open them if I wanted to. 

*One more night of no sleep would’ve killed him*, I thought. I opened my eyes as the tears subsided.

Because our mansion is haunted as hell.

However after some time of living here you learn how to deal with it.

For example, we have the Butcher who walks around on the first floor at night.

He will offer you food but you should never accept it.

As long as you remember that you will be fine.

Other spirits  are trickier.

The Crawler, as we call him, used to be a child who was murdurered here.

Something about a unlegimiate child or something.

Anyway you can sometimes hear him inside the walls.

Knocking and scratching.

If you stand still to long he comes out of the wall and will try to drag you into the wall.

He will try to chase you into a dead end where you'll be defensless.

However if you sing a song or something it will go away.

My favourite ghost in the house is the ""Chainer""

At night you hear the ratteling of chains all around the house.

Sometimes the sound changes to chains being dragged.

According to my parents the chainer was a woman who was tortured or something.

I had become old enough that my dad put me charge of the horses, but it was Marsha who first realized one was missing. Marsha lived on a neighboring farm, but she spent most of the daylight hours at ours. All of the horses had come in for their daily food and grooming except for Clint Eastwood, a beautiful brown stallion and a favorite of Marsha’s. We spent the late afternoon taking care of the horses. Marsha left disappointed after waiting for Clint until dusk.

Marsha arrived the next morning and we became worried when Clint remained absent. We left on the ATV to search him. Coming up to the edge of the tree line at the far end of the property, I noticed a spot where all the trees sat at strange angles and a few had fallen. Our worst fears transitioned from imagination to reality as we pulled up to a large sinkhole that gouged the earth across the tree line. Marsha hopped off the back of the ATV and climbed down onto the muddy beach that had formed overnight.

The sinkhole exposed a powerful underground river that raced through the gouge from one end to the other. Hoof prints and a long slide mark were easily visible where the beach met the river below. Marsha collapsed in tears and I called for her to get out so we could go get my dad. As I was getting off the ATV to help her out, the embankment began breaking off in chunks and was swept under the earth. Before either of us could react, Marsha had fallen in with a shriek and was carried away.

I panicked and tried to follow the course of the underground river, but it was useless. I rushed back home and a search party was formed. The next day one of the volunteers found another location where the river temporarily breached the surface. The river here was bordered by moss covered rock that sloped down toward the water. Police arrived and climbed down the embankment with climbing gear. The only thing they found was a fingernail and bald streaks where the moss had been scraped off the surface of the rock.

There was no other news until weeks later when a body was found in a river several counties away. I try not to imagine what it was like for Marsha, to reach for the redeeming light of day, only to be dragged off that rock and back under the crushing darkness, but visions of her continue to haunt my daydreams and nightmares.",shortscarystories

"I see me,

I see myself in it,

I beat up the mirror,

Because I see a monster,

Blood gushes out from it,

It's no longer showing what I look like,

It's showing someone else,

I see a hand reaching out of it,

"I knew that he had a bad relationship with his parents. I think everyone knew that. But past that I don’t think anyone new him. 

I was beginning to think no one knew him at all.

But I’ve always lived with the mentality that everyone could be your friend, if you got to know them that is. 
I spoke to him for the first time then. Possibly the first time any of us had. 

I liked him.
He was kind and funny and we had almost exactly the same sense of humour. 

We became friends very quickly. He came to mine sometimes and we hung out after school. One day I asked if I could come to his. He stared at me and said, “there’s a reason no one knows me. There’s a reason you don’t know where I live” and that day we didn’t speak much.

I secretly followed him home that day but Who wouldn’t? I just had to know what was wrong. I followed him further along the road. We left town even. I had never been so far from home.

Then we reached a wall that stretched around the horizon. 
He walked straight through it.
I panicked as any person would and pulled myself back to civilisation.

Is this what he wanted? Had he known I would followed him. I had a horrible feeling I knew him more than I let on

I noticed them from then. The anomalies. Sometimes cars would cease for a second in the corner of my eye. People watched me but pretended not to know who I was.

"It shouldn’t have taken her this long to call back.

“Maybe twenty minutes at most,” I told the officer with the flimsy notebook. It was too small for his large hands. As for my hands, they were dripping in icy sweat. I had been storming through town, crunching through the snow along our favorite hang-out spots searching for her. The officer continued to look down seriously at his little notebook scratching down only every one to two words I sputtered at him.

It had taken an hour for the officers to arrive at our dorm, even after I had told them I had been searching for her the prior four. I finally raised my choked voice to get officer tiny notebook to look at me and take this seriously. I needed to tell him what I wanted to tell him. I broke:

“We got off the phone six hours ago, she told me she was a mile away from our dorm. She *should* be here by now. She isn’t. She does this all the time, even before I knew her.” The officers were both shaking their heads in solidarity. They were grown men dealing with a crying little girl on a Friday night.

My roommate had a habit of hopping trains after finals. Running through the woods in Boulder, Colorado—soaking up the intricate coniferous smells of the trees. The snapping of twigs increasing as she ran alongside the passing train. It was all about timing she said. She was an adrenaline junkie, and she enjoyed the rush.

“You might want to look along there. By the railroad stations and tracks in the South. She told me that’s where she would jump off.” I had always made her tell me where she had planned to get on and get off. I had lost friends before to this hobby.

The police were eventually moved by my concern. I had given them exactly what they needed to find her. My performance was the grand finale of the whole adventure.

She is probably infested with worms by now. Maybe she’s even dust. But she is dead, dead like all the rest. Details don’t matter after you’re dead. The officer knew this, which is why he only had to use one page of his 2x4 notebook. I led them to her, wasn’t that enough? It took me four whole hours to walk back home. That train took us far.

"A quiet knock with some tiny steps

A tiny boy stands with quiet kept

A little tug on my blue duvet

A quiet plea, “please can you stay?”

“My little boy, go back to sleep

Go to your bedroom, don’t make a peep

In the morning, come say goodbye

You can’t sleep here son, but nice try”

“But daddy,” he cried, I need you to come

Into my room to see what I’ve done

I made a wish and it came true

I’ll never have to be away from you”

I wipe my eyes and sit up straight

“I have not time for jokes this late

Now go to bed and care to dream

You aren’t as cute as it may seem”

“But Daddy! Daddy! Its more than real

I spoke to the man and we made a deal”

I threw off the covers and then sat up

“My child I’m done, I’ve had enough

I’ll take you to bed and tuck you in

But this is it, my son, I won’t do this again.”

“Ok Daddy! Lets hurry! Quick!

He said that its real, its not a trick!”

I opened the door, and saw a man

He stood up straight and held out his hand

“My name is Jon and I came to help

I’m a kind man if I do say so myself.”

I was stunned, he looks like the dead

A zombie? Or vampire? in my son’s bed?

I stood in shock, he grinned really wide

“Please don’t run and don’t try to hide”

“Daddy! Its him! He heard me call

I thought he was scary, but he isn’t at all

He gave me a wish, but only the one

I said, when dads gone, I don’t have much fun

He said we could play forever and ever

You won’t have to work, not now, not never!”

The man is an angel, he came with a blessing

“But the price will be high, that’s what I’m guessing”

The dead man spoke and said “it is not! 

I am a fair man; you will get what he bought!”

He took my hand and grabbed onto my son

“forever and always having such fun!”

The next thing I know, I wake up in the dark

I can’t feel a thing, not even my heart

A fowl light brightens my darkened sight

“I won’t hurt him; I’ll treat him right”

It’s written all over this box that I’m in

I can’t hear him speak, but I can see his grin

“You didn’t spend time with your son or your wife

So, your son made a trade, a life for a life

I’ll take your place, and you will take mine

My health returns, while yours will decline

Ill play with the boy, and tend to the missus

"My parents abused me as a child and none of my classmates seemed to particularly like me much. I had very quickly decided this wasn’t the time I was meant to be born in. Perhaps in the future I could be happy or perhaps in the past. All that mattered to me was I wanted to explore a time alien to my own. By the time I was 14 I had done it. Space and time at the palm of my hand. It had taken a year to build, using scrap I found in dumpsters on the neighbourhood but it seemed stable. I couldn’t wait to leave my god forsaken life. The handle felt like a sword in my hand and as I pulled it, I felt time rip apart around me. I went back. Way back. I saw houses rise and fall. I saw trees shrink into nothingness.

"Meeting Sophie was the greatest day of my life.  My father brought her in, she was covered in dirt, sweat, and tears. She was no older than 12 (as was I) at the time and I promised to protect the sweet girl right when I saw her. 


It took awhile for her to say a single word, but when she did speak I swore I fell in love with her. She told me what had happened and how she ended up here.  


 Spohie told me everything to the tempter of that night from what her room looked like, she started to cry. I pull her in my arms and whisper to her, “It’s okay. You’ll be okay here.” I rubbed her back. 


She never found out who or what caused her parents’ death. But I knew and I would never tell her the truth. 



As the years went by Sophie and I became closer. However, she would always ask what my family did for a living, since we lived in a mansion with over a 100 acres of land. I knew she would want to know sooner or later but father said not to tell her, not until she’s part of the family. 


I had made sure she had a bodyguard when she wasn’t with me. When she was with me, I made sure we were alone. I would hear rumors going around that I was obsessed with her, I got rid of every server I heard talking ill of me and/or Sophie.  


I proposed to her when we were 19, we never even dated but I wanted her to be mine and mine alone. Father gave me his blessing and mother’s ring, Sophie would have my heart and I would have hers’. She said yes.


It was our wedding day, father was helping me with my tux and I could only imagine how Sophie was. Was she getting her make-up ready? Was she ready and just staring out the window with a big smile on her face? Was she crying out of joy because she was going to marry me? I smiled. I was going to love her and keep her safe.


I waited in the church for her. My father was going to walk her down and the church benches were filled with family and friends. Finally the music played and Sophie walked down the aisle, our eyes met and she gave me the most heart warming smile I’ve ever seen from her. 


Then a man from the coward stood up and pointed a gun at me. Everything happened so fast, the man pulling the trigger, Sophie running towards me, my father pulling out his gun and shooting the man dead. It was then I realized that the shooter was Sophie’s bodyguard. 

I look up and see Sophie crying, but her eyes weren’t sad… they were happy. 


Later on I found out that Sophie and her bodyguard were sleeping together. That Sophie had only said yes to my purposely because it was a part of her plan. Sophie had found out that my father had killed her parents, her town, and set her home on fire. She only acted, she only played along for her plan, she lied to her bodyguard about running away with him, he was a pawn in her game. We all were…


Meeting Sophie was the greatest day of my life, marrying her would have topped that, but it turned out to be my last day.


Sophie may not have loved me like I had hoped, but that won’t stop me from being around her. I watch from the shadows as she kills my father, runs our family business, has children of her own, and is now getting ready for her son’s wedding. 


I look down and in my hands is a pistol. I smile and look up at Sophie, even at this age she is gorgeous, I aimed my pistol to the back of her head, but I speak before pulling the trigger,

"""Holy shit! I think I found one! THEY'RE REAL!"" 

The archeologist heard the shout from one of the numerous pits they dug near the abandoned ruins of the city. He dropped his thermos of water, which bounced on the ground, and went running from under the cool shade of the tent and into the beating sun. 

He clambered into the dig site and peered over his partners shoulder at the small bleached bone protruding from the scorched earth. 

He couldn't believe his eyes. Without another word the two of them proceeded to clear away the ground around the bone with delicate, practiced precision. 

They had the entire skeleton excavated and assembled before nightfall. There were two specimen. The larger one was found clutching the smaller one in its embrace. 

It wasn't too difficult to piece the remains together; the bones were all near each other. The creatures couldn't have died more than six or seven thousand years prior. 

Both of the archeologists stared at their work in awe. 

""Look how fragile these things are,"" one said. ""Just one spinal column and one head? And look at these tiny digits on each limb. So delicate! They must've been such peaceful creatures..."" 

The other nodded both of its heads and clicked its mandibles together. Something about the small skeleton emanated sadness. ""The bigger one seemed to have been trying to protect the smaller one from something before they died. I wonder what killed them?"" It contemplated aloud.

They were silent for a minute, looking out at the crumbling remains of the dilapidated city with their numerous eyes. It was pockmarked with enormous craters. 

The creature let out a sigh. ""I guess we'll never know.""",shortscarystories
"  I was looking.  I was looking for them.  My boys they were getting big, and I was looking for them.  I went to their favorite store, the one just down one floor and hopefully they were there. 
  But they weren’t, they weren’t there.  Maybe down by the ice cream stand, they’re always asking to get some ice cream, even if they never finish it.  Most of it ended up all over their face anyway. 
  I called to them, I called out loud and looked for them.
  Where could they be?  Their mother will be so upset with me for loosing them.  They’re good boys, they’ll take care of each other I’m sure.  Where are they, where could they be?
  It’s small at first the pain in my chest, the growing tension wrapping around my rib cage as the fear takes hold.  It’s not a normal fear, it’s a physical tension like someone reaching into your chest and gripping your soul.  It’s almost a helplessness.  My walk pace quickens, and I begin to look at the people’s faces as I walk faster.  My mind begins to paint images, like the ones you see on the news.  Girls kidnapped as children held captive for ten years, or child snatched from the front porch in broad daylight.  The vice in my chest has been turned and the pain has stretched out and around to my back.  My breath has become short in and outs. 
  My quick walk, is now a jog.
  Where could they be?
  I see something, I see a few people standing around on the third floor. 
  I don’t know why but I know it, my boys might be there. 
  My jog, is now a full sprint up the escalator.  I call out loud and looked for my boys. 
  The few people have grown, it’s now a small crowd.  I round the first corner, heading for the up on to the second floor.  I hear a familiar sound, a voice I’ve heard almost every day for years now.  It’s my wife, but how can I hear her I can’t remember where I left her?  The crowd is larger now, and I can see paramedics at the mall entrance running in.
  Second floor, full blown charging through people.  Can’t they see I’m in a panic, trying to get up there?  I’m looking for my boys!
  I’m half way up the last escalator, I’m bobbing and weaving through the people.  They don’t take any notice of me and I’m looking.  The sound of my wife is growing, it’s filling my ears as I get closer and I don’t see her yet.  The paramedics haven’t made it up here yet.  I begin to pray and I don’t pray really.  I beg whatever deity or greater power there is to please make this end well.
  I’m jumping the last two steps and my wife’s wail is all I can hear and the people are everywhere.  I follow the source and find my wife inconsolable; she can’t even hear me.  Her eyes have lost all light of anything I’ve ever known.  It becomes deafening, it begins to have a ring and I can’t stop it.  I put my hands on my ears look down and close my eyes because I don’t know what’s happening? 
  “Daddy?”
  What?
  “Daddy?”
  I open my eyes, and my wife’s phone is there.  She had just taken a picture I was standing there with my boys, and they were eating ice cream.  We were leaning on the banister just…just there…
  “Daddy?”
  I turn around, I can’t hear anything anymore and the paramedics aren’t here.  My boys are standing there, with the ice cream in the same place as the picture.
  Where’s the bannister?  Someone could fall and get hurt. 
  “Daddy? Why is Mommy crying?”
  I rush over, kneel down and hug my boys and the tension that had gripped me was gone.  Relief flooded and all fear was released.  I turn to tell my wife, but she’s still not looking at me, even when I call. 
  “Daddy, I dropped my ice cream and I’m sorry.”
  I looked at my youngest and wiped his cheek, “it’s okay we’ll get you a new one as soon as we clean it up.  Where did you drop it?”
  He pointed…
Down to the first floor…
Where the Paramedics had stopped…
The ice crème was there next to…
Me…
Me and my boys, where we fell.",shortscarystories

"Has anyone else seen the girl on Highway 1? My friend (John) and I were driving home from a trip to Mexico.

As night fell we realized that the winding coastal curves would not be easy to navigate; there were no lights, only reflectors which barely illuminated the road.

I slowly drove around a particularly steep curve. As we finished rounding the curve my headlights illuminated a figure sitting on the side of the road. 

John told me to pull over, he kept saying we needed to help her. I pulled over and put my hazard lights on. We got out and walked back to the curve where we saw the figure.

When we finally reached the spot John shined the flashlight on the ground looking for footprints but there weren’t any.

I took the flashlight and started walking into the woods yelling into the distance. After a few moments I headed back to the road. I could hear John talking to someone in the distance.

When I got back to the road I saw the girl standing in the darkness, the beam of my flashlight bouncing off the reflectors around her. 

John ran into the road to grab the girl, as he managed to reach her piercing beams of light flooded the road. A car rounded the turn and slammed into John, the air was filled with the crack of glass, the thud of an impact, and the screech of tires; the scent of burnt rubber filled the air. The car stopped for a moment. The engine roared back to life, and the driver sped off.

I ran into the road yelling. My blood turned cold as I heard a little girl giggling behind me. I swung the flashlight around, the beam illuminated her bloody shirt, partially mangled body, and twisted gleeful smile.

Fear and adrenaline coursed through my body, my heart pumped loudly in my ears. I ran. No longer caring about John. I got in the car and took a deep breath. I turned the key and my headlights lit up the road.

The girl stood in front of me, her broken leg dragging behind her as she lurched forward, mischievous smile ever present. I stomped on the gas, no longer caring about anything.

I looked in the mirror and saw the girl sitting in the backseat. My blood turned to ice, “are you my daddy?”, she asked. I jerked the steering wheel. My car careened through the metal railing, crashing down the side of the mountain. The world spun around; everything went black.

As I’m writing this I’m handcuffed to a hospital bed. Doctor says I’m lucky to be alive while the police officer says I’m accused of murder. 

The little girl with her mangled body stands in the corner of my room, her arm twisted behind her back and her neck bent in an unnatural position. Night after night as the lights go out she repeats over and over again, “are you my daddy?”",shortscarystories
"A letter sheet showed up today unexpectedly. It rested on my stoop.  No noise betrayed its arrival,  no postal markings or travelware appeared to afflict its surface.   It merely arrived.

It was gold, made of a foil with an odd texture that illuminated when the sun danced upon its surface. How did such an exquisite piece of parchment, accidental or otherwise, wind up at my doorstep.  It perplexed me.  I stood in consternation with my eyes transfixed upon it.


The notion that the parcel may have arrived by some mistake was gone, replaced with a lust for it. It overcame so quickly I didn't know what I was doing.  Some...unseen force, coaxed my being toward the peculiarity. As I approached it, the sun gleaned off the foil. The glint burned into my eyes; the spell was broken for a moment. I took a breathe as an unnatural shade grew above me.

I peered upwards to find what produced this ungodly darkness.  In a chaotic swirl, clouds came from all directions, rushing to block out the sun.    They engulfed the entirety of the sky in a matter of seconds, stealing away the colors of the world.  


An icy chill came over me and I saw my panicked breathes lingering in the air.  I became aware of thinly veiled breaths forming all around me.  Faint whispers emanated from the tiny clouds. Attempting to discern meaning out of the mad ramblings was futile.


 ""Hello?""


In response, a volley of sickening shrill screams and pleads reverberated back-to-back with no time to comprehend what was said...or asked? Their breaths turned to a thick mist and I could see gnarled human forms writhing in pain. What was the cause of such suffering? I couldn't discern.


My attention turned to the once golden letter sheet.  The foil, now black, belied the texture that was vivid only moments ago. I was repulsed by it, wanting nothing more than for it to be gone.  Evil exuded from it; making a mockery of life. A revenant from my past reached for me and grasped my arm with zeal. The pain was excruciating and rendered me inexorable. ""Open IT!!"" It wailed.

My body betrayed my thoughts. The apparition pulled my uncooperative hand toward it.  My struggle was in vain for in a matter of seconds it was in my possession.  My fingers traced the seal back and forth. I was unable to resist..

The instant it opened the misty figures disappeared, the cries for help ceased and the sky cleared.

The letter simply reads,

""Enjoy the tranquility""

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and soaked in the sun.

The earth started to tremble beneath my feet.  A looming figure towered over me.  I knew him.   A victim I sent to an early grave.  His body twisted and mangled,  just as I left him.  Only now he wasn't lifeless.  He was only the first tormenter.  Seven so far...but I had many vices.",shortscarystories
"I woke up with a start. 

Breathing heavy, I looked around the dark bedroom. Glanced over at the framed photos showing me: Naomi Henderson. My nerdy glasses, the long black hair. The awkward smile.

I shivered in the January cold… Here it was three A.M. The witching hour.

Clumsy, I reached toward the lamp. But the bright light didn’t help. My eyes struggled to adjust. I felt dread rather than safety. And then I saw why.

Bull Man was back. Amidst my blurry daze, I saw him standing in the doorway. The only clear sight in the entire apartment. 

Dressed in a flowing red robe, he stared right at me. Rather than a head or face, his hood attempted to cover a bull skull. The bones so pristine. The horns protruding out the cloak as if this man was the defiant Devil himself...

Terrified, I bolted inside the bathroom. Flicked on the lights..

My feet splashed through water. Now I saw the one sight that was crystal clear: the bathtub. Two tiny bodies floated in the water. A naked boy and girl.

Fighting back tears, I stopped at the counter. Its surface so full of mysteries. A smorgasbord of items unfamiliar in this haze…

I ran my hands over the counter in a sloppy search.

Heavy footsteps interrupted my panic. I looked toward the doorway.

Bull Man stood a few feet away. This terrifying sight so *clear* when everything else was out of focus. 

Then came the sudden splashes. I faced the bathtub.

Both the little boy and girl stood up. Their bulging eyes glued to me. Their bodies bloated from many days and nights spent in this aquatic crypt.

“Oh God…” I cried.

With heightened fear, my hands moved in a wild rhythm on the counter. Until I felt it: the small plastic case.

I popped it open and stuck those fucking contacts in.

Then I looked around. My cold apartment had been remastered in an instant. Everything now so clear.

To my relief, I was alone.

I then realized this was my last pair of contacts. My new glasses wouldn’t be ready till next week… After risking an eye infection, I’d decided to try sleeping without the lenses. Only every time I did, Bull Man came for me. 

Deep down, I knew Bull Man and the kids were the only clear things I’d ever seen on my own. Without the aid of an optometrist. Those frightening sights the lone occupants in this distorted world.

More disturbing thoughts hit me. Were Bull Man and the children figments of my imagination? Or were they what was really out there… were they the true beings behind my man-made veil?

Maybe I wasn’t the only person who could see these creatures… Maybe those 20/20 lottery winners weren’t so lucky after all. Maybe they *always* saw the horror…

Now my eyes were really watery. Through the nerves, I struggled to suppress those tears. Struggled to keep those contacts from falling out.",shortscarystories
"Me and my buddy John were going on a caving trip. We had decided on it last August. We were both very excited for it.

That's why when we found a path that went deep, we were ecstatic . Deep was an understatement though. It was steep, very steep.

""Come on John, stop lollygagging."" I said jokingly.

""Well I have to carry the freaking equipment,"" he replied.
 
We continued careful down the path for a while, until we came to a chasm. It dropped straight off, so I had to stop John from falling off.

"" Jesus Christ!"" He shouted 

"" That was close."" I breathed out.

The chasm was deep and very wide. I could see that. Something was odd about it, like something was inside of it.  John was the first to say something.

""We have to go down this monster,"" he said excitedly. I watched as he set up the harnesses and descended into the darkness below. Jesus, he was impulsive. But soon enough, I was following him. 

The darkness seemed to get heavier as we descended. We actually passed a few human skeletons on the way down, which is never a good sign. We kept on going for what felt like an eternity. Then, we felt the ground beneath us. Or what felt like the ground.

When I turned on my flashlight, I was completely surprised. We weren't standing on the ground, we were standing on massive skull.

""Holy shit."" John said, mouth agape. Whatever this thing was, it was unimaginably massive. Think of a blue whale. This things nose socket dwarfed that , by a lot. 

In utter shock we walked along the things spine. It was the largest thing  I have ever seen. Which raises the question, how did it get trapped in this ravine?.

My question was soon answered as the skeleton began to shake, with a massive rib falling down into the darkness below. I heard a groaning sound coming from down below. I looked . 

I shouldn't have done that, because there down in the depths of the chasm, dwarfing even the skeleton was a pair of giant red eyes.",shortscarystories

"I can't tell for how much time i've been here. I can't even tell where i am. Fire is all i see and screams are all i hear. It's so fucking hot. Was it hours? Days? Minutes? God it's so hot here. All i can see is fire. I can't run away. It's coming towards me again. The screams, oh my god. I'm going crazy. There are so many bodies here. 

I can't find a living soul here. Is this hell? Loneliness, death, fire, pain? What have i done to deserve this? Someone help me. Someone help me. Please. I can't stand it anymore. My lungs burns everytime i scream. So much smoke. I can't take it. I keep walking, looking for someone. I won't give up.
I can't give up. I don't remember why but I can't. There is so much smoke. Everything in my body burns. It's so hot.

It's so hot. I can't think straight anymore. But I hear a voice. I'm walking. The voice keeps getting louder and louder. I see the person. He's using a heavy coat when it's so hot. He must be crazy. The fire affected his brain.

Now that I think about it, I'm wearing a lot of clothes too. What the fuck. I should take it off to cool down a little. 

I can almost understand the voice. I must keep going.

*Aye Bob, get over here mate. And keep your equipment on, you crazy cunt! We need to stop this fire. Don't give up now!*

That's right. I remember now. It's not hell. Not yet.

Flashes of red encapsulate her. Replacing the cool white and blue of the control room. “PRESENCE IMMINENT!” Blasts through the speakers between the metronome buzzing. Pulled out of hyper-sleep to bear witness. She gazes through the tempered glass, at their long sought after prize. After a millennia they found it, the center of our existence. She gulps. What was once thought as a star, gigantic and dwarfing in contrast to its known brethren. Was only forgotten light, reflecting off it’s shifting mass. 

Mr. Handler, rushes up to her. Wide-eyed and panicked,  “What’s happening?!”. She ignores him. *A geologist,* she thinks, *how useless. Out here.* 

Among the limitless expanse of stars and possibility, they float motionless in front of the thing. Feeble and insignificant in front of the centerpiece of time and space. Blind, wild eyes skirt the edge of it. Immeasurable tenebrous limbs slap soundlessly against itself.. Whirling and twisting, it’s seemingly infinite bulk undulates in the vacuum of space. The demon sultan, the blind-idiot god, dances for the unworthy. 

“My god.” Mr. Handler whispers, in awe or in horror, it’s hard to tell. Something builds in her chest, pride maybe. Her eyes well, and drip. *Our god.* Susan dreams.",shortscarystories
"I was leaving the bar after a rather uneventful shift. The night was cold and I was tired, looking forward to the warmth of my bed. I hurried down into the tepid subway station to be welcomed by a lone violinist, churning out sharp notes. The platform was largely empty with the exception of a few drunken twenty somethings awaiting the next train, and a young girl in a tight black dress, apparently deep in thought. 

A train screeched into the station and the riotous group was swallowed into the light of their train, leaving the violinist, the girl and myself alone on the platform. I closed my eyes and let myself enjoy the sad sound of the violin  reverberating though the silent air. I opened them to find the girl in the dress standing before the player. She seemed to be in some sort of trance, her eyes carefully tracking the movement of the bow across the strings. As I watched her, I realized she was shoeless, her feet dirty, her dress stained and torn at the seam. 

As if signaled by a cue, the violinist launched into a new song, as the girl began to dance a complicated pas seul, her eyes still fixed on the player. Her movements were effortless and perfectly timed with the violinist’s tune. I tried to remember if I had heard them speaking, or if this duet had been silently communicated between the two of them. Time seemed to stop as I became lost in his music and in her footwork. A train horn blared some distance away, reminding me that time was, in fact, moving ceaselessly. I would soon be torn from their duet. 

The station began to vibrate as the pair seemed to brace for some sort of peak, the tempo of the music picking up as the girl’s movements took on an unusual urgency. The energy between the two of them became palpable, their bodies in perfect synchronicity. The tunnel began to grow a bit brighter as the train pulled closer, as if to shine a spotlight on this strange stage. 

The girl made a few careful movements leading to a flawless leap directly into the path of the train speeding into the station, in perfect time with the violinist, who ended his piece with a sharp, final note that echoed though the empty station. 

The doors to the train opened. I stood on the platform, trying to process what I had just seen. I looked back to the violinist, who was packing up his tools, apparently unfazed. I started towards the light of the train only to be stopped by a dirty pair of black stilettos, abandoned in the center of the car.",shortscarystories
"You read that right.

I am tired of fighting for you.

I suppose by now you will be thinking this is one of *those* stories. The ones talk about *you*, talk *to* you and warn about the shifting, slobbering beasts of darkness leaning over your shoulder. No, no, do not worry about turning around. There is nothing there. I made sure. I always make sure.

I should have written this privately, I suppose. That way I could have guaranteed *you* read it, and made it less likely for my brothers and sisters to find it in turn.

But I do not care.

I think, even as I write this, that I do not truly *want* you to read this. I do not want you to believe this. 



I have been watching you for a long, long time. Longer than the year this account shows, actually, but that is unimportant. It may relieve you to know that you are a decent person, comparatively.

They will kill me once they find this. At least, I hope they do. We all know they have much worse fates to issue than death.

I am not meant to contact you. If you so much as catch a glimpse of me, I can face... near mortal consequences. They like to push that edge, see how far we can go to the brink before being pulled back.

But I am tired of being silent.



They have stopped caring. About me. About you.

We are still assigned charges, as we always were. Only about a tenth of the population is 'watched' as you are. You should consider yourself lucky. 

I am meant to protect you. Those 'bad feelings' you have about suspicious situations or people are usually caused by me, warning you, trying to keep you safe. So far, you have been easy. You have listened. 

But still I tire.

You and I are now treated as... equals, in a sense. Both promised grandeur, only to be replaced by higher divinities and cast away to toil and suffer for our remaining days. In short, whatever I do will not matter, because neither of us matter. Regardless of what I, or any of my brothers or sisters do, you and your kind will never again be enough for our father. Neither will I, nor any of my brothers or sisters, no matter how much blood we bleed.

I have dodged around it many times, but I must say it once. If not for you, then for myself. I am your guardian angel. I cannot save you. Nobody can. And you are one of the good ones.

You are not longer meant to be saved. And I am no longer meant to be a savior. We are entertainment, for those who made us, and for those who then moved on. I am tired of fighting for you.

I hope you can make it without me, though it will not matter either way.

Until we meet again.",shortscarystories
"As Cynthia takes a look at her garden, she can’t help but gasp in awe. The grass is the greenest she’s ever seen it, the roses look big and strong, and each and every lavender seems to have bees circling it.

Cynthia thanks me, tears welling up in her eyes. I don’t blame her for crying, she’s been very fragile for the last eight months. Ever since she got the news of her husband’s disappearance.

I tell her it’s just to make her feel a bit better. She smiles and thanks me again.

When I took this job one year ago, I thought it would be easy, as I have experience caring for houses like this one, with many rooms and a big garden. Cynthia would be gone for a year, traveling round the globe, and her husband could use some help making sure the house stayed together. Simple enough.

I’d heard stories about her husband by the time I got there. I’d been told he was weird and very different from his wife. He liked to go on night strolls, and if people, especially women, crossed his path during one of these, they tended to stay away. No one liked him very much, which made me feel sad.

He was happy and welcoming when I first got there. He stayed mostly silent while Cynthia showed me around the house, but he joined in on the laughs we had and even told a few jokes of his own. They were clearly happy together.

Then she left.

This was before every house had a phone, you know. So I had no way of contacting her and telling her about what was going on. At first I didn’t worry much, as they only seemed to be accidents. Staring at me for a little too long while I cleaned, that kind of thing. Then it started to seem intentional. Opening the door to the guest’s bedroom while I was pretending to sleep. It was wrong.

One day he got tired of waiting. While I was doing the dishes, he came up behind me and put a hand over my mouth. He held one of my arms, forcibly. I remember grabbing for the nearest piece of cutlery.

It was sad for Cynthia, yes, but not for the rest of the town. Everybody thought he had it coming, for one reason or another. Most assumed he had gotten run over during one of his night runs, but nobody cared to check.

After that, I made the garden pretty for her. I felt like I had to make it up somehow, as she was convinced he was a good man. He had made her believe that. I grew her plants and watered every spot.

After all, she was gone for another eight months after her husband disappeared.

And I had some good fertilizer.",shortscarystories
"Throughout my life, I had always considered myself reasonably healthy. I didn't eat all that well and I might have been a bit chubby but I never had a problems when it came to illness. I'm 26 right now, living on my own and doing quite well for myself. As of recently, I've developed a small cough. I was reminded of something that happened a long time ago. Something I had forgotten about for some time, and I've decided to post it here.

It started with my Grandpa, he was quite aged by the time I was born but he kept going until I was near thirteen. Thirteen.

The day before I turned thirteen. That was the night I saw something I really wish I didnt.. Ever since I could walk, he had a terrible cough. One that seemed to never stop. That wasn't the worst of it either. You would wake up in the night, hearing his relentless sprees of discomfort echoing through the house.

One night, I got more curious than I should have, I was already sleepless in eagerness if my birthday the next morning so when I heard my grandpa, climbing his way across the halls into the bathroom, I was already a little jumpy and energetic.

I couldn't help the urge but to follow. I stepped out of my bed, trying to be slow enough to quiet the creaks of the old floor boards as I tiptoed my way past the bedroom door and into the landing.

I saw the yellow light of the bathroom bulb sliding across the floor of the landing, grandpa's hunched shadow shaking still.

I crept from wall to wall as Grandpa continued to wheeze. As I drifted my eyes into the bathroom, just letting me watch from the corner of the door frame. I saw a horrible sight that has forever burnt itself into my mind.

I saw saw his coughing become quieter as he squeezed a black centipede slowly out his mouth as it dropped into the sink and scurried away into the drain.

Tears fell from Grandpa's face as he dried his chin and plugged the sink. I dashed away into the hallway as he abandoned the bathroom and went back into bed.

That was a nightmare for me to witness. Even now after his passing, I'm still afraid, because now I walk into my bathroom, in the middle of the night.

With a terrible cough.",shortscarystories
"I'm thirsty.

The first person I came across on the sidewalk helped me get over my withdrawal, however. As I sunk my teeth into their neck, the horrible feeling vanished quickly.

I dropped the limp body and continued walking. 

...

...I'm thirsty.

It's been like this for a long time. Similar to tonight, I was walking down a sidewalk when someone with the same addiction leaped in front of me. I felt a sharp pain, and tuen a quick draining feeling. They sucked all of the blood out of my body. And life isn't the same anymore.

Every few minutes, a pain starts to burn inside of my chest. It starts off small at first, but then it starts to evolve. The whimper becomes a statement, and the statement becomes a yell, and the yell becomes a cry, and the cry becomes a shriek.

A shriek crying ""I NEED BLOOD.""

And I need blood.

I tackled someone else from behind, ripping off their scarf and chomping down on their neck. They struggled for a second, but only for a second. Not like they wouldn't be up and moving soon after.

I stood back up and kept walking.

...

...I'm thirsty.

I've been ruining so many lives because of my addiction, and I hate it. I hate what I'm doing. But can I stop it?

I stopped walking.

*Can* I stop it...?

...

The whimper began. 

Don't listen to it.

The statement began.

Don't listen to it.

The yell began.

*Don't listen to it.*

The cry began.

*DON'T LISTEN TO IT.*

The shrieking began.

*DON'T LISTEN TO IT DON'T LISTEN TO IT DON'T LISTEN TO IT I NEED BLOOD I NEED* ***BLOOD***

I screamed out loud, the pain inside me becoming too much. A civilian in front of me turned around, confused. Their eyes widened as they saw the hunger in my eyes.

I grabbed them and swallowed everything from within them. The pain vanished.

I dropped the still twitching body, whose life I had just ruined. Because I can't stop.

I can't stop.

I continued walking down the sidewalk, wiping away tears.

After all, I'm still thirsty.",shortscarystories
"In the crisp night air, amidst the darkness, a little girl walked down the sidewalk, alone. Her yellow dress illuminated only by the halo of a streetlamp, she didn’t seem to have a single care in the world.

On the other side of the road, covered in a coat of shadow, Butch looked on. It was a little odd to see a kid her age outside on a night like this, alone, but no matter...

This is going to be easy, he thought.

Butch quietly limped across the road, eyes fixated on her as she went further down. Tracking her footsteps, he made sure to stay quiet. He didn’t want for this moment to be ruined. It was all too good for him.

25 minutes had passed, and he still followed, slowly, but surely. He understood that she couldn’t go down this path forever. She would have to make a detour soon enough. But, when? When would that happen?

She stopped, and so did Butch. The streetlamp flickered. 

A wave of nervousness befell him. Was she going to turn around? And if she did, would she see him? Would she take off running, and escape? Butch knew he had a bad limp. If she did, he wouldn’t have his fun.

A bead of sweat trickled down his forehead.

The little girl turned, now facing left. She treaded in that direction, into an alleyway.

Butch was relieved. Things would proceed as he had foreseen after all.

He trailed behind.

The little girl stood at the end of the gloomy alleyway, her outline visible. Butch was at the entrance.

A smile formed on his face.

He took one step forward.

His heartbeat quickened in anticipation.

Then another.

His breathing tensed.

And another.

He reached for the knife in his pocket.

Before he could pull it out, the little girl was already on him.

He tried to get out, but her small arms were enough to keep him pinned down on the ground. Her strength was enough to break his bones, making him cry out.

With her pale eyes, the little girl stared into Butch’s frightened gaze, saliva pooling from her mouth as she grinned with long fangs.

To his horror, her maw opened, and it grew wider, and wider, and wider, and then....

She stopped.

The girl couldn’t move.

The same could be said for Butch, and everything else.

There they were, silent and unmoving, struggling to make a motion, a sound, anything, but to no avail. Both failed to process what was going on.

A mass of the gloom began to close in.

They could only do nothing.

It enveloped their entire being.

They were terrified.

Everything went black.

"He sat the edge of the cliff, watching folds of red light dissolve into the darkness of the desert horizon. Clouds unfolded beyond the rising moon, stars peeled back blue smears of day's last breath, and he slid the rifle out of its case.

He kneeled and aimed, hands steady, finger poised. 

Night swirled over the barren earth in shrouds of black, and out of the darkness emerged strands of fire roiling over the unseen earth. They coalesced into a creature wreathed in flame, embers orange and red searing black sinew, as if a skeleton afire marched over sheets of shadow. 

He fired, the rifle roaring over the silence, the bullet scattering embers and ash into the dark surrounding the demon. It vanished into smoke and erupted beneath the ridge, glaring up at him faceless and merciless. He fired again, exploding the hateful fire into talons of smoke that retched towards him and reassembled over jagged rocks below. 

He holstered the weapon, stepped away from the edge, lit a cigarette, and waited. 

Smoke heralded the demon's arrival, floating upwards over the lip of crooked earth and hovering before him. It opened a mouth of fangs and screamed, plumes of black smoke writhing with agonized faces. 

He answered with a plume of smoke of his own, enjoying his final cigarette and remembering the bodies he had left in this same dead desert, the countless pleads and snivels from his victims that smeared into a collective wailing of beggin voices. The nightmares had come months before, the demon's face rising out of the oblivion of sleep to torment him, stealing his joy, his peace of mind, until he realized it was calling him, calling him to this place where all he could do was end it once and for all. 

The demon strode forward and stopped before him. Its heat watered his eyes and seeped beneath his flesh, but he did not flee. The demon reached out and stroked his face, and with its touch he felt fire and every bullet he had ever sent into his victims. Tears streamed, blood bubbled, but he nodded and dropped his rifle. 

The demon embraced him, hurling shafts of agony through his being, and as he withered he knew that somewhere in the pyre of ashes he would leave behind, there would be some kind of forgiveness.

For in the great and vast wastes of the world, the memories of countless dead are not forgotten, but waiting in profound silence to reach out and take hold of those who must be held accountable. All will be reckoned. All will know the forgiveness of fire.",shortscarystories
"The noises started two nights ago. I woke up around midnight and heard the rustle of leaves directly under my window. I got up from the bed and looked the window, but I didn’t see anything or anyone.

After a few minutes I went back to bed and didn’t hear anything. About 10 minutes passed and I heard a tapping sound on the window, like a “click, click, click” in quick succession, a shiver ran through me, I’m not going to lie, I was scared to death, and I was too frightened to look. A few seconds passed and the sound came again, “click, click, click”. I reached over to my light and turned it on, I dared to look over to the window; nothing was there. I left the light on and didn’t sleep for the remainder of the night.

Last night it started again, only this time it was worse. I woke up feeling depressed and unsettled, like something wasn’t right. I looked at my phone, 2:19am. A few moments passed, it was dead silent, then the tapping started on the window again, this time the tapping was harder and more aggressive than the previous night. After a few more moments the tapping turned to a more aggressive banging, the window started shaking.

I got up from the bed quickly. In a split second I saw a woman standing her face and hands pressed against the glass. The window began to open, cold air rushes in, the frigid January air hitting my flesh like knives.

I was frozen, paralyzed with fear, I wanted to scream for help, my mouth opened, but not a sound came out. The window continued its ascent, I could see the woman’s face. Grotesque. Her flesh was bloated and grey, she smiled in a twisted toothless grin; her body was smeared in dirt and patches of decaying flesh. Her arms reached into the window and she began to pull herself in. Finally she stretched her arm out, her hand wrapped around my ankle, her filthy nails digging into my flesh, she pulled me too her. She called for me to help her, a familiar voice reverberated in my head.

I finally managed to overcome my fear and I kicked her away; I ran like hell. I opened the bedroom door, I begged the universe not to have anything or anyone else on the other side; as if my prayers were answered it was clear. I entered the hallway and ran for my life, bolting down the stairs. I reached the front door and took a deep breath. I turned the handle and prayed.

I opened the door. It was clear. I ran into the darkness; until I reached the nearest town (maybe 2 miles away).

Maybe I would get blown up by a grenade again?

Grenades are the worst because most of the time they don't kill me instantly.

Instead the shards bite  into my flesh, not only hurting like hell but also slowing me and making me more vulnerable to other people.

"Mrs. Sarah Ann Ashley sat upon her porch swing, eating a ripe red peach and awaiting the detectives. Any moment now, they would be by to question her about her husband’s disappearance.

She was not worried. She was, after all, innocent of any wrongdoing.

The sweet, sticky juice dripped down her fingers as her teeth split the peach’s flesh from its pit. She sucked it away before it could drip on her crisp new dress — its pale blue would surely stain. I’ll have to change before I bake that pie, she thought. Between the peaches, the flour, the sugar, the eggs... well, there was no way she could possibly stay clean.

She squinted up at the sun, descending lower and lower into the west, and sighed. If she was going to have the pie ready by dinner, she would need more time than she imagined the officers would need.

And she did yearn to bake that pie. Grinding Edward’s bones finely enough to mix with flour had been a fine idea. And his flesh had made such a wonderful addition to the fertilizer she preferred for her peach trees. It would be a tribute to him — a fitting tribute, she thought, to a man who kept her locked in a room and starved for six months.

Innocent of any wrongdoing.

"My name is Carlos. I’m a six-foot tall topiary shrub cut into the shape of a brontosaurus. My only really distinguishable features are my daisy-eyes. Just because my eyes are daisies doesn’t mean I can’t see. Actually my eyesight is amazing and I’m really proud of it.

I’m also very much in love. Cindy is twenty-seven and she’s a human. I think she loves me too. We lay around on the lawn a lot together and we have picnics (she feeds me Miracle-Gro) and we look up at the clouds and imagine we’re seeing pirate ships and buffaloes and castles made of cotton candy.

The only problem is Cindy has this habit of picking my eyes whenever we’re together. For her they’re just flowers and she likes to make little chains sometimes or press them into cards as keepsakes. The first few times I didn’t say anything. I like Cindy to be happy and my daisies can always grow back.

\*\*\*

After a while I asked Cindy to stop picking off my eyes. She got mad and said that the flower art was an important part of our dates for her and if that wasn’t a big part of our relationship then she didn’t really think we’d work out as an item. I didn’t say anything. I let her pick off my eyes.

The broken stems leak and my eyeholes itch a bit, but it’s okay. My daisy-eyes still grow back regularly enough to keep my Cindy happy. She’s getting a lovely collection of chains and pressings now and sometimes we look at them together and we laugh. I have to just forget that all those flowers used to be my eyes and I can relax enough to laugh with Cindy. The tree surgeon tells me that my daisy-eyes will only grow back so many times and if I don’t start protecting them there will be permanent damage.

\*\*\*

I’m blind now. I can’t see and I’m in a lot of discomfort, but it’s okay. Cindy and me still have our lovely picnics. She still feeds me Miracle-Gro. Because she can’t pick my eyes off anymore she’s started picking away my leaves. I can’t look up at the beautiful clouds now but Cindy understands. She describes the shapes to me and we laugh. Laughing really helps with the pain.",shortscarystories
"***It might be said:***

&amp;#x200B;

I'm always bombarded by the most irrelevant thoughts while I'm working, and they always drift towards my father. What does he think of me? He always hated that I didn't follow in his footsteps. I can see him now, looking down on me. I was never good enough in his eyes. But here, I'm the best. Even if that doesn't count for much it means the world to me. I'm a stripper, and I have no qualms about that. No, I'm not feeding the hungry or clothing the poor, but I make a difference in someone's life; I brighten their day, and I take pride in that.

&amp;#x200B;

Nonetheless, there are few who would say this is their calling, including me; we're all here for the money. It literally falls in your lap. Mostly on the floor, though, and sometimes you drop your dignity picking it up, but you can always find it next to your g-string and bra… and hopes. Aside from the obvious setbacks, It's not all bad; the women here are like family, we have to be, this town is too small to be anything else, and though this isn't a strip club in Atlanta, I do alright for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, with so few residents in this town, we're really competing for patrons, which makes your regulars worth their weight in gold. I got a few, but most of my money comes from one guy. I abhor him, but I'd be stupid to chase him away. Despite my feelings, it's not like he's physically or verbally abusive or aggressive. In fact, he's always courteous and clean. Instead, I hate him, because his gaze deflates me, but for as long as he has me, I'm always dedicated to making his problems fade away, so I bend, pivot, twist, twirl, grind and caress on every inch of him. When I'm done, I dismount him, and as he stands and moves toward the door, I crumple into his previously occupied seat. While he towers over me, I dare not meet his gaze. Instead, as he tidies himself, my mind always wanders to a corner on the farthest side of the room and spectates. From over there I'm safest.

&amp;#x200B;

However false that security may be, it's all that's gluing me together, so instead of shattering, I watch his hand dive into his pocket and surface with a wad of cash. As he counts it, the sound of money scraping across itself underscores my misery. After he finishes counting it, he squares the bills and presses them into the table with his index finger curving through the pressure square into their center. Then, he appraises me for what seems like eons before sighing, sliding his fingertip off of the arranged stack of bills, and turning to leave, but before he crosses the room's threshold, he always rejoices to me, **""you did a fine job baby girl. Same time next week then?""** Defeated, I always mutter back, **""yeah dad… same time.""**",shortscarystories
"It surrounds us, a black mass without even a glimpse of light. The panic lays still in the air, we can sense it, we can feel it. Is this how our lives are going to end? Inside a pitch black underground pit, stuck with that creature. We can't see it, but we know it's watching us. Every little step and every breath, it's there.. Observing us.




I take her hand and try to lead her through the darkness on the rough ground, we stumble and swear quitley to ourselves but are able to find a big rock to sit down and rest on. I can't see her clearly, but I feel her fear – it's the same one that I'm trying to hide. If only I knew what was out there, if only I knew which way to get us out of this godforsaken place. Our hands are still intertwined as we sit with our backs against each other, I feel her body moving as she listens to the sound of it. If only my hearing worked, I feel like a sitting duck just being still here - not being able to know when it will strike.

It terrifies me to know, that that thing can attack at any given moment and I won't be able to escape until it's too late. I pray that if - and when - it attacks that she'll make it. She has to, even if it means I have to die.







We've rested enough, we need to find a way out. I tug at her and together we rise up slowly, careful not to make too much noise. I stretch my left arm out - still holding her hand with my right - so that I can feel the wall beside us. It's incredibly smooth – I mean, we are in a cave and you would expect it to be a bit more rough - but it's like touching silk. No man could have done this..
Before I can finish that thought she tugs at me and I stop. We wait a few moments and finally she taps my wrist, giving me the signal to start moving again.

The cave seems to become smaller the further in - or out - we go. We're crawling now, the ground is still rough and I feel like my hands are bleeding from the rocks scraping against my palms. I wonder how she's doing behind me, but I dare not pause in this tiny entryway.


Wait.. what's that? I crawl faster and faster, finally.. I see light. Oh, glorious light how I've missed you. I still can't see behind me, but now I know we're saved. A way out, finally we can be free from that horrible thing.
The space around us grows bigger and we can finally stand up on our feet again. Without a second thought I bolt in the direction of sunlight, her hand in mine and for the first time in days - or is it weeks - I laugh. 

We've reached the end, I can see grass, trees and brushes. The distance closes in and we slow down, finally safe and sound. A bird lifts up from the ground and flies away as we reach the exit, I let go of her hand.

Once outside, I turn around and my heart drops. She's not there. I look down at the ground and I see it. I stagger back and cry out in terror. It can't be.. No.. Please..


All that is left of her. Right by the caves mouth. 

Her hand.",shortscarystories
"As I lay in bed and try to sleep. I heard them above my head. Footsteps. The thumping, scraping, footsteps keep me up. I clutch my thin blanket closer, holding my breath as hear the heavy thumping stop over top of me. They pause then continue. I turn over to my side, letting out the breath while the chain rattled on the floor. 

I took comfort in knowing the light there. It's never ending blinking gave me a sense of security. Its flashing, a sense of calm. It was the only source of light in the inky black void of a room, at the moment anyway. I stared at it until my eyelids felt heavy.

Finally I got to sleep. The long day of work had tired me greatly; I was just entering a dream when the door opened. 
*Creaaak.*
The top stair went as weight was put on it. 
*Thump.
Thump.
Thump.*
Each stair followed as the person came closer. The metal bowl clanked on the cold cement, I heard it spin before it stopped.

My food was here!  

I sat up and pulled the blanket back, careful not to get it caught on the lock latches around my ankles. I got on my knees and started stuffing the thick gruel down my hungry gullet as quickly as I could. The flashing light stopped and a bright light came from the center of the room, shining directly on my face. The camera auto adjusted its lenses and tilted down to get me in full view. 

I forced a wide grin, the gruel dripping from the sides of my mouth on to my white stained dress. 

""Thank you Sir! I promise, I wont ever be a bad girl again."" ",shortscarystories
"I had my first joint at the beginning of sophomore year, and I fell into a world of peace and tranquility. Day in and day out, I’d smoke or eat edibles. It helped me feel safe when I should be.

One day I ran out, and was particularly aching for a kick of something. My “friend” came by and told me he’ll be changing his menu from now on. However, I can still have his new shit. 

“What in the living fuck is this, man?” I asked

“It’s some tabs of LSD man. From downtown man. That has some kick in it so I’m gonna have to charge extra.”

“Wait, how do I use this? Do I put it on my arms like a sticker?”

“Just leave it on ya tongue man.”

I gave him my money and he left, leaving me with a whole sheet of these psychedelics. Shit, I didn’t know what to do, so I just took me all. Nearly gagged every time cus’ of the taste. It had an odd metallic flavor. I sat on my couch and waited. Anyway, ten minutes and nothing. I wait another 30, and still nothing. So I thought “fuck this shit” and got up. 

I went up to the mirror and immediately saw a change. I looked into my dark,empty pupils and noticed a change in shape, but not just any shape. My pupils pointed in an arrow like formation, leading me out of the bathroom. I grabbed the closest mirror I could find and followed the arrows. It pointed right. 

I walked through the hallway, but never looked away from the mirror. I felt as if I was being watched. I eventually Gained my confidence and turned around, only to see a glimpse of something. It’s contorted body stared at me, without moving a muscle. I returned to the mirror for guidance. My pupils pointed straight ahead, to the balcony at the end of the hall. I sprinted, all while hearing painful panting from behind me. I made it to the balcony, and turned to close the door. There it was, frozen and only inches away from grabbing me. I shut the doors, and turned back to the city. It’s bright lights charmed my eyes. All the mesmerizing colors distracted me from the true horror behind me. As I heard banging on the door, I looked into the mirror. My pupils pointed down to the bottom of the building. Without question, i stood on the edge of the balcony. People from below me cried and pleaded for me not to jump. I turn around only to see the thing with its broken mouth lurching slowly towards me. 

To escape the living nightmare I was in, I leaped. I’ll never regret what I committed, even as I lay here in my pool of blood, with folk recording me with their flashing lights.",shortscarystories
" I wake up and it’s 6 am. The sun is rising and it is the middle of August. For some reason I feel cold. My fan is off, and my air conditioner is broken. I usually wake up sweating. I have to work at 10:30 anyways, there is no reason for me to go back to sleep, so I go to shower. My fingers are so cold I can barely grab the handle to turn the water on. Eventually I get the strength to grip it and I turn it on. Water starts to drip out of the faucet and finally streams down onto the surface of the tub. I step into the bathtub and I feel relaxed. Surprisingly it is more relaxing than usual. I feel lifted and light on the ground. Just a bounce in my step today. Why am I so ready for the day? I walk down the stairs and feed the cat, and then myself. It’s colder on the ground floor than it is upstairs.
The front door is open. Maybe that’s why it’s so cold but I panic. I locked the door last night right? Oh fuck, I don’t even remember yesterday. Did I smoke weed yesterday? That answers why I am so relaxed. I find a half joint on the coffee table. Yes, drugs. Where are my roommates? They should be here. I check my watch. 6:45. Breakfast is needed. Coffee. Sugar. My body starts to drain, like all the energy seeped into the floor. Groggy. Speechless. I sulk to the fridge. Ignoring my surroundings I open the fridge.
Empty. I turn around and suddenly realize the walls are empty. And the house is clean. Where are all my photos. Where are my roommates? I run to Erica’s room and she’s not there. There are boxes lining the wall, stacked about 3. I run to Andy’s room and he’s asleep. I touch him to wake him up and he doesn’t respond. He’s always hard to wake up. I scream in his face. I yell and clap and stomp. Nothing. He’s snoring so he's not dead.
I’m confused so I leave the room. I walked back to the kitchen and see something on the fridge. It’s a photo of me. It’s a nice photo, so I have no idea where they got it. I think nothing of it and check the time. 7:30. I go back to my room. It’s different this time. My room is empty and the only thing on the wall is a note. I pick it up and read it. It’s a suicide note. Apologizing for everything. For disappointment. For a job loss. For a breakup. It’s signed. By me. And it’s dated for yesterday. I turn as the room goes dark. A deep voice is all I hear now. “It’s time, I’m here to take you now”",shortscarystories
"""Once upon a time,"" the little girl started, reading to her family as she always did at dinner time. They loved to hear her read them stories. ""There was a little girl who belonged to a loving family. They laughed and sang and ate good food together, and life was good.""

Someone walked past her house. The footsteps were muffled, but that was normal. They were outside, after all.

The little girl's voice turned slightly sad, and her family noticed. They always noticed, but never said anything. ""Then one day, a terrible monster showed up. He was big and mean and awful, and he took all their happiness and gobbled it up. And then, one by one, he gobbled up the little girl's family until she was the only one left."" 

The footsteps got closer and closer. She heard the sound of the door opening and then closing again. 

""The little girl was very frightened, but she couldn't let the monster gobble her up too. She had to save her family."" The little girl smiled at her mother, her sister, her brother, her daddy who was gone so long but now was back. ""So she went to the kitchen and got a biiiiiiig knife when the monster was sleeping, and cut him open so that her family would come out, and they all lived happily ever after for ever and ever and ever and ever..."" 

Dr. Stanford sighed heavily, listening to the little girl chant as she rocked back and forth. Cases like this were always the saddest. He gently reached out and touched her shoulder. ""Elizabeth, it's time for your medicine.""

 The little girl looked up in terror. ""NO! DON'T TAKE MY FAMILY AWAY AGAIN! PLEASE!"" Dr. Stanford just sighed once more and gently placed the anesthesetic mask over the little girl's face, and she eventually passed out. He slowly began the routine process of unstrapping her straight jacket and administering the antipsychotics. She had to have them injected in liquid form, because she refused to eat... 

He shook his head as he walked out, and his assistant wore a disheartened expression. ""A real shame about what happened to her."" Dr. Stanford nodded and despondently said, ""I have very little hope that she will ever recover. A child should never have to witness that. The only good thing about the whole situation is that her tormenter got what he deserved...""

A few hours later, Elizabeth woke up. She looked around and started to cry, but started telling another story. Her family would come back if she told enough stories. They always did. 

""Once upon a time,"" she began in a trembling voice, ""There was a little girl...""",shortscarystories
"She woke up starving. It was strangely quiet in the house. 
She got up and walked to the kitchen, usually she was greeted by the smell of fresh coffee brewing, but not this morning.
She looked around the room, and noticed the light on the coffee machine still blinking. That must mean John had already made his coffee and went off somewhere. She moved into the living room, and noticed his coat was not hanging by the front door. 
She went up to the window and peered out at the front yard. His truck was gone as well.

She knew he had been talking about going hunting, but she had hoped he would have said goodbye to her before he left. This meant she would be alone morning, and he knew she struggled to do things for herself.

She was starting to feel cold, he always turned the temperature down when he left the house, and she couldn’t reach the thermostat. She was only in her thin nightie. She walked back towards the couch and sat down. Thankfully there was a fleece throw that she could curl up in to keep warm. Although she had just woken up, she began to drift back off to sleep. She slept a lot these days.

Hunger. The hunger in her belly startled her awake. What time was it? How long had John been gone? She got off the couch and looked out the window. The sun had already moved across the sky, meaning it was past lunchtime. What was taking him so long? She couldn’t wait much longer for him to get home. She needed to find something to tide her over.

She walked back into the kitchen and looked around. The cupboards were too high for her to reach, and the fridge had a magnetic lock she couldn’t open. He said it was for her own good. She needed to control what she ate, he didn’t want her getting “too big”.

She knew there were canned goods in the cellar, but she wasn’t allowed down there, it was John’s special space, and he had locks on it as well. If he caught her eating anything that he didn’t give her she knew there would be hell to pay.

She suddenly heard the rumbling of his truck coming up the drive, she left the kitchen quickly and went back to her spot on the couch.

The truck door slammed shut and she could hear him shuffling his hunting gear as he came up the front walk. His keys jangled as he opened each lock on the door. The door opened with a bang as he tossed his duffle bag across the living room floor.

He looked up with her with a wide grin as he shut and locked the door behind him. “You hungry Princess?”  He walked up to her and grabbed her shackled wrists as he made her kneel by the bag. “I got something real good for us to eat today.” He held her chin up to his and gave her cheek a kiss as she shuddered. “Hey now, that’s no way to treat your daddy.” His features turned menacing and dark.

“Sorry daddy.” She looked up at John and moved her head from side to side so her pigtails would bob back and forth. He liked that.

He seemed to relax a little, laughed and said “it’s okay princess, now be a good little girl and help me unload our haul.”

He unzipped the bag to reveal a very small, very terrified little boy, bound and gagged, tears dried to his dirty cheeks.

And her stomach growled.",shortscarystories

"It started one sunny afternoon, lying on my back in the park, when I fixated on a passing cloud. 

&amp;#x200B;

The cloud looked like a boat bound toward some hopeful horizon. It bounced across the sky. I could hear the muffled accordion and the rum tum tum of palms on thighs keeping beat with gravelly sailor voices. The cloud banked up as though cresting a wave, then it fell back smack! into its course, blowing eastward. 

&amp;#x200B;

I stood up and walked after it, leaving the edge of the park and winding through the blocks of houses, gazing past the electric lines to maintain my target. 

&amp;#x200B;

It kept drifting, I kept walking. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes it would dodge ahead of me on a sudden gust and the song of its travelers would fade, but I would break into a jog until I heard the song rise again, the accordions, the palms on thighs, gravelly voices...

...I followed...

...I followed...

You may have seen me in those years. I wandered the streets. I gazed eternally at the sky. I took on the grime and stench of my quest. My eyes went pale with sky gazing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Until I finally found the secret of wings. Every human being has wings. You just have to peel the skin back to find them. Under the skin of your arms there are lovely white wings, wrapped in red feathers. You just have to peel back the top layer and there they are. Lovely white wings. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't expose my own wings, of course. I will need my arms intact to man the rigging, to hoist the sails, to keep beat on my thighs while the others sing. So I am forced to borrow wings.

I have three pairs now, peeled back clean to the quick. I think just one more pair will give me the lift I need .

You understand, of course. I'm sorry to take them from you, but I think just one more pair will do it. Stay still. Stay still, please. Please...and be quiet.

"My father wasn't a good person. I knew that from the first time he hit me. 

My mother couldn't or wouldn't stand up to him. He continued to hurt me and my siblings. I had gotten used to it, being too frightened to speak.

 That's when the Shadow man first appeared.

He had three distinct features. One was that he was ungodly tall. He was also all black, like the night sky but without the stars. But the thing that scared me the most was his smile.

His smile was the only thing on his face. It stretched from one side to the other. I shuddered in terror. Then he spoke.

"" Did he hurt you?"" He said. 

His voice was surprisingly smooth and deep. I could only nod trying to hold back tears.

"" Don't cry , little one. It shall never happen again.""

 His smooth voice grew rougher at the last word. But he was still smiling. He walked out of my room as I stared at the spot that he was at.

“I din’t see them.”

“Really?”

“I saw Jennie. Bill was home.”

“You say you saw Jennie go into the woods but Bill was at home?”

“Yeah.”

“Mr. Fromier, I find that a wee bit hard to believe. You know, we found Bill’s jacket in those woods. We found his jacket soaked in about a pint of blood. Jennie’s blood. We found her, too. Funny enough, she was just a few yards away. We took some pictures. Want to see?”

“Pictures?”

“Of the body. Want to see?”

“No.”

“No, I expect you don't. They’re not pretty. But nevertheless they beg the question, what was Jennie’s blood doing on Bill’s jacket? And why do a dozen witnesses claim to have seen them leave together from the football game?”

“Witnesses?”

“Mr. Fromier, I know you followed them from the field. We have it on CCTV. So I ask you again. Did you see Bill take Jennie into the woods?”

“I…”

“Did you?”

“I din't.”

""I think you're lying.”

“Bill was home. We go together from football. Bill said take Jennie home.”

“You took Jennie?”

“It was cold. Bill said take Jennie and take my jacket. I said let's go to the woods. Jennie said no. It made me mad. I pushed her. She hurt her head.”

“What?”

“I hid her in the woods. I was scared. I din’t want trouble. She woke up. She was mad and screaming so I hit her. I hit her so she shut up.”

“And the jacket?”

""Jacket?""

""Bill's jacket.""

“I hid it.”

“Where?”

“Under my bed.”

“Christ, no, not under your bed.”

“...”

“Think! For once in your life, fucking think!”

“...”

“You hid it in the woods.”

“I hid it in the woods.”

"His upper lip had been completely destroyed. His gums and teeth showed. His right eye was gone. It was just a smooth crater covered in melted skin. But his left eye seemed perpetually open: a sharp, green eye, watching me from behind an almost inhuman face.

I held eye contact with him like no one else on the train seemed prepared to do.

I smiled at him.

He didn’t smile back.

He couldn’t smile, but that wasn’t the reason he didn’t. His expression grew darker. His unblinking left eye seemed to fill with hate.

The public address system announced that my station was next and relief swelled in me so strongly that I nearly vomited.

When I alighted from the train I didn’t even look back.

I commute on the same train daily and when I boarded the next evening the burned man was in the same carriage.

Did he know my schedule? Had he been waiting for me? Why was he still looking at me with such hate?

\*\*\*

The next journey too was exactly the same: The sun going down through the train windows and the man— his face like a lump of brutally chiselled mahogany, his drooping lip slobbering onto his shirtfront— staring at me.

When my stop came up this time I exited as always, but I couldn’t help taking a backward look.

The burned man was standing by the window, looking out at the platform. His one sharp, green eye was drilling into me, accusing me.

The weekend came. I was spared the commute for a few days. It was sunny in town and I went out for a little retail therapy. In the forecourt outside the mall I saw an old friend from a distance. She was too far away to approach but I hadn’t spoken to her in years and so I promised myself I’d text her later.

At home that night I kept my promise. I wish I hadn’t. The small exchange of texts between me and Laura was the most traumatic event of my life. This is what was said:

**Hey, Laura. Been forever. Want to grab drinks sometime?**

**Who’s this?**

**Katie. Your brother’s ex.**

**Fuck off, Katie. Don’t contact me again. I’m blocking you.**

I was so confused. I had to know why.

**Is it because I broke up with Alex?**

**DO NOT CONTACT AGAIN, KATIE!**

**Laura. I know he’s your brother but we just didn’t work. I’m your friend. It’s pretty shitty of you to shut me out for leaving him.**

**Katie. I didn’t want to tell you this but maybe you should know after all: After you left Alex he doused himself in kerosene and set himself on fire. He’s got 90-per-cent burns.**

The phone fell out of my hand. I remembered the face on the train and for the first time I recognised it.

 I remember that night, a bright white streak in the sky flew with incredible speed. Before I knew it, the object connected with the horizon. 

 Out of curiosity, I decided to check where it landed, and how much damage it had caused, the following morning.

 The object, which refers to itself in a tongue that is incomprehensible to all men but me, sat in the middle of a large clearing within my fields. It sat there, and it called to me. It had begged, pleaded for me to come to it. It offered its knowledge and power to me. I was drawn in by its lure.

 My hand should have never touched that damned rock.

 My mind melted and reformed. My eyes blackened and rotted, only to regrow within their momentarily vacant sockets. My muscles exploded and tore yet remained the same. The object spoke to me. It told me where it came from. I didn’t understand, yet I did. I spoke not a word of its tongue, yet I spoke it fluently nonetheless. It reached into my mind as I reached into its.

 I’ve been in a constant struggle with it since. My strength and intelligence has grown tenfold, yet I feel like a prisoner in my own body. I’ve stopped eating anything but raw meat and raw eggs, any sort of animal based food. I get to decide not what I consume, my stomach and mouth has grown a mind of its own.

 The object spends day after day talking to me. How it does this, I do not know. I’ve travelled as far away as I could. It won’t stop speaking to me. It tells me of the things it will do to humanity, of things it has done to my body already. It’s hatred for life has consumed me.

 On that faithful night, I had wished the shooting star to make me a better person. Now, I wonder if this is my tragic fate, as the beginning of the end. I wish it would stop planting these thoughts into my mind. I wish, I cry, I laugh.

 I hate the object. I hate it.

 It has come from the far side of the moon, and it won’t leave my head.",shortscarystories
"In the woods somewhere you could find beauty, a calm serene place. Maybe a babbling brook would be near the damp earth where you sat, amongst the cold mountains were pines reign and snow only melts for a short time. Maybe it would be calm, maybe not. In the woods somewhere is where I am, deep in the mountains. I breathed in the lovely mountain air as I walk along some wildlife trail. I set my foot down and then, nothing.

I woke up at the edge of a lake, surrounded by fog. I looked around and noticed the acute lack of bird calls. Normally they were quite noisy. I got up and started walking west, where I parked my car. Everything was fine, until I walked into a hanging corpse. I dialed 911 but there was no response. no one picked up the next four times I called either. I felt terrible for the corpse hanging, but there was nothing I could do. If I cut it down there could be legal complications. So I kept walking.

The deep fog got even deeper as I walked. I couldn't figure out were the sun was anymore. I knew I was going west still, so I knew eventually I would run into my car. Instead I ran into another corpse, hanging from another tree. I wondered what had pushed not one, but two people to kill themselves in these woods, so close together. I tried the police a few more times, and there was no reply.  Ashamed that there was nothing I could do I walked on.

The fog kept getting deeper, pushing me into a darker and darker twilight. As it got darker, I kept running into the hanging corpse, the same one. The same tree, the same clearing. after the 40th time I turned around. I hoped I could reach the lake. Instead I ran into the same clearing again and again, but this time the noose was empty. For days I wandered as the world was thrown into darkness. I wondered what I had to live for so badly. Eventually I could see a little. Everything was getting incrementally brighter. With that brightness came the realization that every tree had a noose I could climb too. Like I was called by sirens, I felt drawn to the clearing. I tried to resist, to go any other direction. All of them led to the clearing. 

I finally stepped in. I felt myself thrashing as the life left my body, then I stopped. My eyes worked long enough to myself, walking into the clearing and dialing 911. In the woods somewhere eventually someone will find me. but they must take care, or they may become me",shortscarystories
"I can imagine few things worse than being lied to by your own mind.

My name’s Stanley. I see things. Horrible things. In flashes mostly, but they happen often enough that I can’t really go outside anymore. I can’t drive, or I’ll see something in the middle of the road that’ll make me veer into oncoming traffic or run off the road. I haven’t hit anybody yet, but I have gone into a ditch or two or three. The last crash totaled my car and I decided it wasn’t worth it to keep. I was just gonna be a danger to myself and others.

That was several months ago and things haven’t changed. It’s weird to say but I’ve gotten to the point where fear no longer has a place in my life. I’ve seen so much horrible shit that almost nothing fazes me anymore. Picture it and I have probably seen it. Even if you can’t picture it, I’ve probably seen it. The amount of blood, guts and gore I’ve seen would probably make Raimi and Yuzna recoil in terror.

The worst of it all is probably the monsters I’ve seen. Again though, see enough of them, and they almost become friends. There’s one that looks like the bastard-child of Voorhees and Bigfoot. Weird description, I know, but you try describing this ugly fucker. I call him Teddy.

But the things I see even mimic the people I know. Or in some cases, knew. I’ve seen my mom, whose been dead for 10 years. My ex-girlfriend made an appearance even though she lives across the country from me. And my now-girlfriend also came for a visit. I thought she was mad at me because she didn’t say a word initially, just sat down on the couch next to me. No big deal, except 5 minutes later, she walked in again. The second time was her for real, according to her at least. Yeah, that one really freaked me the fuck out. I broke up with her soon after. I don’t think she believed the whole “it’s not you, it’s me” but if you’re reading this, you’ll know what I mean.

I just heard someone say “Hi.” I looked down the hallway and there’s a man standing there with a knife and giant smile. I’ve gotten use to these visits by apparent “murderers.” But it is a little weird. None of my visions have ever talked before.",shortscarystories
"Airports are the worst. But I was so proud of the deal I got on my flight, I didn’t even care.

I saw the attendant pulled the microphone to her mouth.

“Flight 113 with service to Hong Kong, we are now boarding Zone 1. Could passengers in Zone 1 please make their way up to the gate.”

I pulled my ticket out of my pocket. I knew I wasn’t Zone 1, but I couldn’t help but check anyway. I was excited. I’d been to Hong Kong before, but not for a whole week. And the flight was so cheap.

“Flight 113, we are now boarding Zone 2 and Zone 3.”

Two parents dragged past me pushing a stroller, their two kids flying around them like bees. The mom snapped her fingers and beckoned one kid to her side as their joined the mass of passengers in line.

“We are now boarding Zone 4, line up at the gate.”

More bodies rumbled up to the line as their predecessors had their passports checked and disappeared behind the gate. I sat back down in my chair. I knew I’d want to stretch my legs while I had the chance, but I was getting tired.

“Now boarding Zone 5.”

The line seemed to stretch longer but the attendants worked diligently to check passports.

“Zone 6, please make your way up to the gate.”

I checked my ticket again. Still not yet. I saw a man in a massive jacket with holes in his pants join the line. I suppose with airline tickets getting cheaper, that was inevitable.

“We’re now boarding Zone 7.”

There were definitely problems nowadays. But flights, televisions, alcohol, they were a lot cheaper.

“Zone 8, please board up at the gate. We are now boarding Zone 8.”

To think, a five day trip to Hong Kong at that price.

“Okay, we are now boarding Zone 9.”

I stood up as a few more emancipated bodies glided over to the gate. I knew my zone was next.

“And last but not least, Zones 10 through 20, please make your way to the gate.”

I stepped in line and waited until the flight attendant beckoned me over. I handed her my passport and thanked her, though she had a tempered, uneasy expression on her face. Must’ve been a long day.

I followed the gate down to the plane and towards the clean shaven man in the bright orange vest standing outside the door. He pointed to his feet, where a two by two foot grey plastic box lay open. I smiled at him, and stepped each of my feet inside. As I curled my body into a ball, I felt my legs immediately start to cramp. Probably should’ve stood for a bit longer outside. Didn’t matter now. As the man closed the lid on the box, I was plunged into darkness.

"""You have two options. Kill yourself. Or kill your significant other. All the choices you've made so far have brought you here. Choose one.""

The screen still says, ""Stab yourself. Or stab the other.""

This is a tough choice. Games these days have this new type of game-play where you're given a plethora of choices to make. Based on those choices, either good or bad, the game decides whether you get to progress. Or not.

People also ask: What is Butterfly Effect?

This moment defines it. This moment decides the worth of the time and effort you've put in.

The next moment you find yourself giving a test to finish an elective you didn't even want to apply for. You find yourself in a battlefield filled with soldiers, all kinds of them. Some armed with air-pods to cheat. Some equipped with their high memory power and some, well, they just are. The battle lasts for two hours approximately. Two hours determine your worth. Two hours decide your place.

By the end of two hours, you realize that the battle's lost already. You waste your entire semester playing video-games and this is what you get. A tight, hard bitch-slap right across your ugly face.

People also ask: Is Karma real?

You get a call from your mom, who is so concerned about your future, asking how your test went. You lie, ""It was great!"".

Lying on one side of the bed, you begin to weep. Your eyes redden and begin to itch. You can hear your heart pounding like the jackhammer crushing the concrete behind your hostel.

You wake up. You start your computer. You launch your game. Thus the cycle begins.  

If you choose to kill yourself, you might begin to wonder what would've been the outcome if you'd chosen the other choice. 

The screen says, ""Hit Enter to Re-spawn."". You go back to the previously saved checkpoint. To experience another version of fate. You finish the game. You quit the game, yet it still asks, ""Are you sure you want to quit the game?"".  

People also ask: Define Cause and Effect.

Surprisingly, your surroundings don't seem a lot different than the graphics in the game, when you are high. Your body looks just like the main character only a bit blurred. Probably the game lags. You can feel the welled up rage from the battle you lost that morning. You can feel the hot blood flowing through your veins through your feet through your joints through your head. You climb up the overhead tank which stands a hundred feet above your head. The view is intoxicating. Literally.

You have a couple of choices of now.

People also ask: What is Newton's Third Law? 

You can feel the cool breeze rushing up against your face. Your second chance at life is just seconds far from you. You make a choice. The ground zooms in and zooms in and zooms in.

"
There is a man living inside my head. He says it’s his job to talk to me. He takes a lot of vacation days, which is nice. When he’s here, those are my bad days. He fills my head with...thoughts. Bad thoughts. He’s very convincing sometimes. My therapist told me that he isn’t real, and he was just a figment of my imagination, but I know what's in my head.

When I was young, he told me my mother’s death was my fault. And what was I to believe, this man in my head, or the people telling me it wasn’t. If I can't trust my own head, what can I trust? So, I spent my years listening to this man. I obeyed him, because I didn't know how to escape him.

I once asked his name. That was a mistake. He made me relive the accident that killed my mother. It felt so real. I listened to myself yelling at her, distracting her. I heard the metal crunch, and smelt the copper. I never asked his name again.

When I was 16, I experienced love for the first time. The man went on vacation for almost 9 months, and I was happy everyday. We broke up, and he returned. He began talking again, more than before. Once again, he told me it was my fault. Of course it was my fault. My mother loved me, and look what I did to her.

I found love again, some years later. I was just out of college, 23 and ready to start my life. She loved me, but she tried to tell me the man in my head wasn’t a man at all. How silly of her. He was very real to me. We broke up shortly after this conversation. He told me I was stupid to even have an inkling of belief towards her. I apologized.

When I turned 24, my father bought me a handgun. He told me since I was living on my own, I would need to protect myself. It was a Sig Sauer P220. I kept it in my bedside table. The man in my head liked it very much.

I was fired from my job two months after my birthday. I was being kicked out of my apartment. The man told me it was time. He guided me to my table, and out to the roof. I had spent many nights on this roof with my ex. It was a beautiful view. I would always say she was much more beautiful.

He reminded me of the love I have extinguished in my life. My doing, always. I was incapable of it, he said. I was a pathetic excuse for a woman, he said. He told me to put the gun against my head, and relax.

There was a man inside my head. He discovered he could no longer live there if there was no head.",shortscarystories
"Some people's tethers snap immediately upon death. And for those people, they end up in the afterlife they deserve, or if they still haven't made peace with their death, they become a ghost.

&amp;#x200B;

But those people are in the minority. Most people recognize that they are dead when they die, but their tether does not. So they end up just....stuck in there, unable to feel anything or move. They're just spectators.

&amp;#x200B;

And that's where funeral directors come in. Once they place you in the coffin, (or the crematorium, if your family chooses that route) you start to feel tired. In a couple seconds, you are asleep. And then your tether snaps, and you go to the afterlife you deserve, or become a ghost. Simple, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

See, if your tether doesn't snap and you were, let's say murdered and buried in the middle of the woods with nobody to find you, and the murderers who buried you don't know how to cut tethers, you are pretty much screwed. Like me.

The ghost that told me this told me that there was no way he could help me. All I can do is wait until the police finally finds my corpse. He feels really bad for me though, because he comes to where I am to keep me company, even though it drains him to stray far from the place that he died, which means he can only stay with me for about an hour a day.

So I wait, with nothing to do. Wishing I could move or feel anything, even pain. I wait in the shell I desperately want to leave, while hoping that someone finally finds my remains.",shortscarystories
"They will kill me for writing this, but I don't care, death is better than what's coming for all of you. Anyway, it's irrelevant. They're probably on their way to kill me just for knowing it also, they already took out everyone I could have possibly told it to. So, as a final act of revenge, like one of these school shooters, I've decided to take some other lives with me.

The sane, those who care about self-preservation, will stop reading at this point, but you're not one of those, are you? You're looking to self-harm, you want to find the most horrific and dangerous shit there is and expose yourself to it, if there was a Necronomicon you would get it and read it out loud, if there was some image optimized by an AI to traumatize humans the most, you would click the link. Well, in my experience, people eventually find what they seek. Depending on how pliable your belief system is, today might be your lucky day, though ""lucky"" is kind of the wrong word here. If you read this, and truly believe it, I'm sorry, but you will likely die horribly.

The short story is this: there are no objective laws of physics. There never were, until we created them. We created them to keep out the unimaginable shit that existed before modern times (unimaginable to modern people, at least). Newton called his book *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica.* It means ""Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"". Newton was from the days that people still remembered. Nowadays, we have books with titles like ""The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences"". There's nothing unreasonable about it, you just have it the wrong way around. Why are the rules of objective reality fit so well to the mathematical structures humans conceive? Because we conceived them to be so.

This was out of necessity. Earlier, we conceived them in other ways. The legends, horror stories about monsters, demons, Hell? They were not legends, they were history. As real as anything we know of. Eventually, we figured out a way to get out of this horror. A systematic mentality based on mathematical logic, where these things cannot be real. We started by indoctrinating children to believe it, and by now all but a select few have forgotten why we are doing it. Even the teachers and professors now think we are actually doing ""science"", learning about some objective world, rather than creating it - just as planned. We make sure everyone understands from an early age that monsters and ghosts aren't real, and we've pulled it off perfectly. Nobody believes in it, reality runs like clockwork. Nothing comes after us at night. Humanity is safe.

Except now. I was one of the select few, and for some reason they thought I leaked this information, and they came after my family. So as revenge, I'm leaking it for real. But I hope for your own sake that you don't believe this.",shortscarystories

Any way one night was different, from what I remember it was mostly about hanging out with a group of people (I can't remember the plot) and throughout the dreams I would see a mascot you would see at a sporting game doing that dance where you thrust your arms in the air and then he would see me and start to charge at me and grab me by the throat.

 from what I remember the other people pulled them off of me and he would run away, it happened like 4 or so times but the last one was different he grabbed me and the background faded away and he threw me but I woke up on my bed sideways (as if someone threw me on the bed) and out of breath as if he threw me out of the dream.

I hadn’t intended to doze here. This wasn’t my bed after all. In fact, the house wasn’t mine either. When I’d picked the door lock it was to sneak in and teach these inhabitants a lesson about trying to fit in where they didn’t belong. I decided to snoop around a bit and after inspecting two other bedrooms encountered a uniquely comfortable bed. That’s when I fell asleep. 

The clinking and the thud were supposed to happen two more times, but I’d only heard the one. Did I sleep through the others? My heart raced. The poison was meant to kill all three of them. It was so easy to poison the pot of porridge left simmering on the burner. The papa, the mama, and the baby were each supposed to gulp down a spoonful and die. They needed to die.

I pressed my palms against the rough and unsanded wood, and pushed. I pushed with all the strength I had available, my elbows digging into the splintered wood that laid beneath me, but, I couldn't move it. It didn't even shift by a millimetre.

I began to sweat. The heat was quickly building from my own recycled air, so staying calm was the better option at this point.

I closed my eyes and laid perfectly still, slowing my breaths to a normal pace, and all I could think about was what she had done.

*How could she do this to me?* I thought. *I'd been nothing but the perfect boyfriend; Cleaning her house, paying her bill's, helping with her daughter...and she goes and does this to me?!*

I frowned and punched the wood, my anger numbing the pain.

*Fucking Bitch!*

The images of last night came flashing before my eyes once again, and my anger turned to full rage.

I slammed my fists against the bottom and side panels, gathering splinters with every hit.

""FUCKINNN BIIIITCH!!"" I punched the solid wood over and over and over again. I used what room there was to kick at the panels as well. I kicked and kicked and punched and scratched, but again, it didn't budge. 

I was sweating buckets now. My breathing ultra heavy, my mouth completely bone dry, and the air was so incredibly thick...No matter how much adrenaline I pumped into my body...I could not move the lid... I could not get out...I was trapped.

I relaxed my body with a huff and waited for my rage to at least half fade away. I closed my eyes and saw *them* again.

*How fucking dare she...In **our** bed, too!*

I shook my head from side to side, attempting to shake the image from my memory.

The oxygen was running out. I could feel it. It was a heaviness that ironically resembled heartbreak, and one that also pinpointed the end...

I wiped the sweat from my forehead and checked my watch:

*Ten minutes.*

At what point in time does a 'toddler' turn into a 'zombie', when both can't form proper thought? At what point does a 'holding the deceased' become 'hugging a corpse'? 


And at what point will exhuming the grave of Patient Zero be 'an archeological expedition' instead of 'grave robbing'?


The police were no doubt on their way, but I knew they would try to cover this up - they had already given me pills that stopped my Visions.

"I had a vivid imagination as a child. I’d run about in the field all afternoon pretending I was a pirate. I’d drag tree branches from the woods to build a ship then spend hours defending it from an imaginary horde of rival buccaneers. An overactive imagination my mother called it, but the school counselor had other words for my inability to focus. He recommended seeing a doctor.

ADD is what they labeled me. Ritalin was the cure. A little white circle of speed-like methylphenidate that worked wonders on overactive minds such as mine. I began popping the small pills daily, and for a while, my focus narrowed like a telescope into a small white circle, crisp and clear. I studied hard and my grades improved drastically. During the nights, however, I’d lie in bed unable to sleep. Some nights I would cry. Another appointment was made.

A new pill was prescribed. A little sand-colored pill called Mirtazapine that kept my Ritalin company, and each night its waves rocked me to sleep as intended. It cast a gentle haze on the days as well, taking away the subtle notes of depression I’d not known I’d had. For a few weeks, the world seemed almost perfect, but then the waves began to rock a little too hard. My legs would tremble as if I was cold and shivering. I couldn’t hold a pencil straight. Another appointment was made.

A little seafoam green pill called Ropinirole took away the shakes from my RLS and I was soon feeling normal again. As I entered High school, hormones and studying for SAT’s caused more anxiety and soon more pills entered the regimen. I was prescribed a driftwood oval SSRI called Fluvoxamine for my newfound panic attacks. Plus a little pearl Ondansetron for the seasickness-like nausea that one introduced.

The ocean blue capsules of Adderall soon replaced my Ritalin, and a tiny salmon pink pill called Lisinopril kept it company to curb the high blood pressure they caused. Little seaweed green gel caps of Loperamide helped curb the diarrhea from those. They weren’t really sure which medication caused the cannon booms of migranes that ached my skull, but I was prescribed golden Oxycontin to handle those.

By the time I started college, my pill collection had grown into a fantastic spectrum of color. A rainbow of hues and shapes that caused and cured each other. Side-effects are to be expected. I go to class Tuesday through Thursday these days. Monday and Friday are for dialysis ever since my kidneys began to fail. The doctor told me not to worry, many patients have lived good lives on dialysis for well over 10 years. There was good news, of course.

"It's happening again. It was abrupt and unexpected, but clear as day I heard his voice call my name from outside. 

I always dread the walk to the front door.

The haunting sounds of faint piano music that drifts through the house every so often has become the easiest to ignore. 

The ""radio voices"" as I call them don't bother me much either these days. There's always static in their voices to where I can't make out anything they're saying anyways. 

But I heard my name, in a voice I know so well, and that has to be real, right? 

I dread the walk to the door because this is not the first time, but I still have to see it for myself. 

I take a deep breath and close my eyes as I reach for the door knob, fully aware of what I'm going to see on the other side. 

I pull the door knob and open my eyes at the same time, to see exactly what I expected. 

He wasn't there, he never was. I am still alone, and now aware of the deafening silence surrounding me. I knew it was happening again, I just can't help but think every time that maybe this one is real.",shortscarystories
"Ring... Ring...Ring

""Who is calling at such an early hour?"" I thought to myself. ""Hello"" I spoke wearily into the phone.

"" The wolf is loose"" whispered the voice on the phone. As soon as the statement was made, the call ended. I sat up in bed for a minute. It was quarter past 3 in the morning. The day I feared had finally arrived. It was loose and bent on devouring us all. 

Fifteen minutes later, I was in my car heading out of the city towards the dark horizon and a small plot of land on an upriver embankment. Driving faster than the limit presented a risk, but it was necessary to elude the wolf.

I had hopes that the wolf would always be kept in its cage deep underground. The men and women  tasked with controlling it had done so for decades with only a few close calls. Yet I knew it was only a matter of if and when. 

Two hours later I settled in for the wolf attack. I opened an old, post-apocalyptic book to a dedication from my  old Air Force friend Bob. It said, "" Tim, if ever I should call to tell you the wolf is loose then diplomacy has failed and society shall soon be vaporized. Run to the hills my friend. Good luck and good-bye"" - Bob",shortscarystories
"It was 12:00 am. I sat on the red, velvety couch having my weekly relief from life, a glass of red wine. I knew that I would regret staying up so late because of the toll it would take on my body in the morning especially after all the previous late nights. Suddenly I stopped thinking about random thoughts and realised how creepy the dark made the whole house seem, so, I got up from the couch and went to turn on the kitchen and living room light. I walked to my living room and sat myself in the same area about to turn on the TV when I heard it: the heavy breathing.

I immediately shot my glance to the window that peeped into my living room and I saw a scruffy man that looked like he was homeless with messed up hair, a rough unkept beard and most creepily of all a smile. Just the way he looked at me; with his jaw hanging loose, with the dreaded heavy breathing it shot terror through my whole body.

I immediately jolted up from the couch. As I did that he grunted loudly. I ran upstairs, dropping my wine glass on the floor. I went to hide in my bedroom's closet and began to dial 911 on my phone that I had left in my pocket. they had answered but all I heard was that same heavy breathing. At that moment the closet door jolted open to reveal him; the man, who had the same physique and the same heavy breathing. I screamed as soon as I saw him.

I woke up in my bed sweating heavily. I was relieved that it was just a dream, I wondered what that dream was and if It had some meaning, at that moment I remembered that my grandmother was good at interpreting dreams so I gave her a call with my phone that was charging at my side table. When she picked up all I heard was the same exact heavy breathing.",shortscarystories
"Allen walked down the stairs, he went to the kitchen to see his dog just sitting there, staring at the wall. 

Allen: Max, you okay?

Max looked back at him, he growled looking at Allen.

Allen: Max, shut up, the neighbors will hear you.

Max started barking, Allen was getting cold all of the sudden, he didn’t care about his dog barking, so he went upstairs and into his room. He eventually fell asleep.

Hours passed, he woke up to the sound of his dog whimpering. He looked at the clock to see it was 3:27 AM. He went down stairs to see what Max is doing. Once he reached the kitchen, Max was all right, but something was off. There was a bit of blood on the floor.

Allen didn’t even bother asking himself where the blood came from because his dog was always seen with blood around him. Allen went to get some tissues, as he was about to get some, he heard human laughter. Creepy laughter.

From Max, whose skin was ripping apart like something or someone is the one doing it. That’s when the thing laughed again.",shortscarystories
"Zombies.

That's the first thing people thought when patients in the BlackSide City Hospital who died came back to life.

3 patients had died from a heart attack. 

1hour later and they came back to life, they ripped open their body bag and began bitting everyone nearby.

The 3 patients were shot in the head by a police officer who happened to be in the hospital to visit his wife.

People expected the bitten people to turn into zombies but when that didn't happen they were thoroughly examined.

Nothing was found, so the hospital had no other option than letting the people go home.

Later a doctor that worked at the hopsital declared that the presumed dead patients were infact not zombies but had an extremely rare of muscle spasms that kept happening for a short ammount of time when the patient died.

People did not believe him but they were unable to find any other evidence of a zombie virus.

People were so focused on signs that pointed towards zombie that they missed the other signs.

The red eyes.

The pointed canine teeth.

And the bite marks in the neck.",shortscarystories
"At least that’s what I thought this morning. But now, ascending the last three flights of stairs to the roof, the doubts I'd pushed to the back of my mind begin resurfacing. Just like all my previous attempts.

Could I really go through with it? Is there really nothing else I can do but... this? 

Two more floors.

I know my mom and dad will be devastated. Probably blame themselves for not seeing the signs, for not being better parents, but... no, it isn’t enough to stop me now. Screw them.

One more floor.

I have to do this, I \*have\* to. There is no other way. The world is such a disgusting place. People are awful. Nobody understands, and the few who might... Well, I suppose I’ll be joining them soon.

I reach the door to the roof.

I’m not gonna chicken out this time. My mind is made up. I take a deep breath and grab the knob. 

Suddenly it twists from the other side.

The door swings open, and I am met face to face with a young woman, her surprised expression mirroring my own.

“Christ,” She laughs, “That scared me! Sorry, I don’t see people up here often. What are the odds, huh?”

""Hm.” Is all I reply.

I move aside to let her pass, listening to her footsteps echo down the stairwell. Unfortunately for her, I had locked the doors downstairs to avoid being followed. Oh well. No doubt someone will be around soon to open them for her. For a second I wonder how she’ll feel when she learns what I came here to do... To know how close she was to someone about to...

I head over to the ledge and look down. So this is it. The moment of truth.

“Goodbye.” I say under my breath.

"   My parents went missing a few days ago. I was especially worried given the phone call I had gotten a couple days ago.
 
   It was an hour before they had apparently driven off the side of a mountain. They called me to tell me about their midsummer trip to the Smokey mountains. 

   The call started out as a pretty normal phone call. Well as normal as you could get with my parents, heh. It soon started getting odd. A fierce breeze had picked up in an instant. I didn't think anything of it. It was the mountains after all. 

   The wind progressively got louder and louder, until it overwhelmed my parents voices. The wind then made what I can only describe as a scream. It definitely wasn't the usual  sound of the wind. A few seconds later , I heard both of my parents cry out, and the sound of shattering glass echoed through my ears. Then it was silent.
  
   Today I was updated.. The police had found my parents car. It was at the bottom of a mountain.  But the strange thing was ... There was no sign that any people were driving. No bodies, no blood, just nothing. There was one thing noticeable however.  One officer had  noted that it was particularly windy that day.",shortscarystories
"As kids, my friend Ali and I would talk about our future together. Who we were gonna marry, how many kids we were gonna have, what house and car we would have, etc. I couldn't imagine a life without her by my side. I remember having a conversation with her one day in my room. Somehow, the conversation was steered towards death and she said, ""It's sad that we can't be at each other's funerals..."" That day, we made a promise to each other that whoever died first, the other would come to the funeral no matter what. I haven't seen her in years since then. Not until today when I saw her waking towards me with a knife in her hand. I didn't have time to be shocked though.

"I awoke to a rumbling sensation. I leapt out of bed, my heart pounding, sure it was an earthquake. I slipped on my shoes and threw wide the curtains. Outside the window all I saw was…

…red

Not even the silhouettes of the cityscape, just red. I couldn’t make out a single shape in the thick, shimmering redness. 

Until…

…at the center of the redness I saw a spot of blackness. It began to swell, to widen into a black disc until it seemed it would burst through my window. It filled my view until only a thin border of the redness encircled it. My breath halted. Was it the sun? Had the sun gone black? 

Another deep rumbling shook me to my knees. Still I kept my eyes on the window.

The black sun receded until it was at the center of the redness and..

"“Good Morning, 01.” Dr. Echoes opens his eyes. A bright light immediately flashes in his eyes. The floor is hard and cold, especially in his current thin outfit. He looks around. The room is a plain white, with no objects in the area. He gets up. Dr. Echoes turns around and spots a door. The door is steel, and there is no handle on it. He looks around again. He knocks on the door. “Hello? Anyone there?” The room is silent. He walks away from the door and back into the center of the room. He looks at the door, trying to notice or discern anything unusual. Nothing. He goes to sit in the corner, to asses the situation. He looks at the ceiling and notices a ventilation duct. “Hello? Is there anyone who can hear me?” No response. “Maybe, I can do something with the ventilation system.” He feels around his pockets for anything. He finds a small card that has a number one engraved on it. He turns it over. “You are the key to your success.” He looks at the text briefly and looks around the room again, only seeing the door. He walks up to the door, card in hand, and puts it up against the door. “Trial 1 complete. Welcome to LABYRINTH.”

“Good Morning, 02.” Dr. Echoes opens his eyes. The light is pleasant as he wakes, the carpeted floor feeling somewhat comfortable. He looks around. The room is a royal red. He noticed a chalkboard with one tick on it. “Where the hell-?” He notices below the chalkboard is a crowbar, and a small card. He gets up slowly, cautiously. He picks up the card. The card has a number 1 engraved on it. He turns it over. “What is this?” He picks up the crowbar. It has slight scratch marks on it, like something was clawing at it. He then looks up and notices the ventilation duct. He couldn’t reach it if he wanted, and he knew he didn’t have a good throwing arm. He feels something in one of his pockets and he takes it out. It’s a small card, similar to the first, except it has a number 2 engraved on it. He turns it over. Subject: 01 “Trial: 23 Cause of death: SawBlades.” “What the hell?!” He looks at the wall in front of him and notices a door. He looks down at the card. “Who the hell was this?” “What is this place?” He takes another look at the first card. “You are the key to your success.” “What the hell is that supposed to mean? What is this place? Why am I here?” 

“Good Morning, 03.” Dr. Echoes opens his eyes. He is holding a small card. He slowly starts to move into a sitting position and he reads the card. It has a 3 engraved in it. He turns it over. “Subject: 02 “Trial: 1 Cause of death: Starvation.”",shortscarystories
"  As I step into the pale yellow light of my bathroom, I breathe in the calming steam coming from the warm bath I prepared earlier. The water running still, I turn off the faucet, take off my robes, and step in. As my skin makes contact I immediately have a sense of serenity, a calmness that comes from a nice bath after a long day at work. I start off with cleaning off myself and hair before taking a deep breath and laying back into the clear crystal water.  Submerging everything but my face, I relax and think about my life, alone with my thoughts. I close my eyes and see darkness. Nice, no worries, darkness.

"The dead don’t remember how they died. He knew this now. 

He remembered being with her, wispy hair gliding in the wind as they hiked up the canyon. She always liked high places. She was so beautiful when she looked at him and he truly loved her. 

A blurry memory of saving her… Had she almost fallen, he given his life for her? That’s how he chose to remember it. 

In addition to the fact that he is dead, he knew three other things for certain. 

First, he knew he loved her with a bond that seemed eternal. 

Secondly, he knew that the energy from the livings’ memories of the dead, the Glow, is what keeps them from vanishing into nothingness.

It was sad to watch some of the ghosts try to move things or make noises; anything to stir a memory for the Glow. He was surprised that he outlasted many of them as his family had perished in an accident, his only close bond was with her. 

Maybe that’s what attracted her to him?

Lastly, he knew he was safe, he knew now that he was her first. ""Was it true that girls never forgot their first?"" He was invisible to the living; she couldn’t keep secrets from him now. 

She still wore his necklace, clinging to it and remembering. He could feel his Glow brighten when this happened. 

There would be no need for him to try and influence the real world to keep his memory alive with her, only the need to keep her safe. 

That’s really the only thing that he could anticipate going wrong. She had several close calls since he passed, each time he was able to shift reality just a bit to keep her protected. It seemed she could feel his presence when this happened, grasping the necklace and closing her eyes. 

This bond, it’s the greatest he’s felt or seen, and she was so beautiful when she thought of him.

She would need his help today; he could feel it. She loved high places… Maybe it helped remind her of him. 

This guy wasn’t unlike him. Loner, no close relationships, attractive, but mostly mediocre. ""His eyes were different, a glimmer, maybe defiance?"" 

She had done her typical move, very refined now, brush the hair from her eyes, a twirl close to the edge and a small misstep teetering over the precipice…

The guy leapt to save her; they always did… 

Twisting to the side she gave the nudge, ever so slightly, just a shift in balance to send him over. 

This one had caught her arm though. Hanging on and pulling her with him… That look in his eyes… 

Maybe it was recognition? ""Could he feel my ghostly energy removing his fingers from her arm as he fell?"" 

He, victim 8, wouldn’t remember when he came back. 

""He’ll glow a little brighter

But he will fade fast

She’ll vividly remember her most recent

But of her first; she’ll forget last.""",shortscarystories

"It was 10pm on a gloomy Saturday, I looked up at the navy sky, a stark contrast against the small and scattered specks of light. I was hypnotised by its overbearing presence and, for a second, reality seemed to melt away. I was snapped out of my reverie by an uneven tile on the pavement, thank god for that otherwise I wouldn’t have seen the massive pothole in-front of me. It was at least 5 feet wide and god knows how deep it was, and Christ it scared me. I walk this same route at 5pm everyday, it helps me to relieve all of the tension I carry with me throughout the day, and I had never ever seen this hole there for the 3 years I had been walking. I searched through all my pockets for a penny, eyebrows furrowed with an inquisitiveness, I held the penny over this gaping hole in the ground and released, immediately I got on all fours and held my ears close to listen earnestly for a sound, any sound.

My hands gripped the crumbling sides as I waited for the sound of a penny dropping on concrete.

I waited and I waited expectantly.

I didn’t know whether to laugh or run away. It was amazing, a seemingly endless hole appearing out of nowhere, but somewhere inside me was an itching unease. My stomach turned with uncertainty and I broke into a nervous sweat. Ignoring this apparent dread festering in me, I decided to drop another coin into the hole, thinking that maybe the incessant thumping of my heart was betraying my own ears. Once again my fist held on tight to the coin, I took deep breaths to calm the rapid pace of my heart and released the coin.

I waited expectantly once again. Nothing.

I stood up warily and shook the debris off of my hands and knees. And I don’t know whether it was the steadfast drone of my heart that distracted me from the clicking of the hard-soled loafers against the pavement, but the pace of the footsteps increased till it went from a hurried walk to a jog to a sprint. I looked behind me for a brief second only to see a tall, lanky man,almost skeletal, mere centimetres away from me, his extended arms lunged forward.",shortscarystories

"It was midnight just outside of town. They worked hurriedly by lantern light. The deceased dug the hole, the doctor held the lantern and the traveler looked on in greedy satisfaction. The deceased scooped up the last bit of dirt and tossed it on top of the pile, flattening the mound with the flat side of the shovel. Wiping the blood from his cheek, he stuck the shovel in the ground.

""There. How's that?""

""It's your grave. I don't give a shit. Now where's my money?"" asked the traveler.

""Alright, hold your horses.""

After they concluded their transaction, the deceased mounted his horse, eager to start his new life free from debt and enemies. As it turns out, they were always running from something.

""You let me catch you anywhere near here and I'll drag your ass back and put you in that hole for real next time,"" warned the traveler, gesturing to his fresh flesh wound.

The deceased nodded. ""Yah!""

It was a prosperous stop for the traveler. He looked down to see double the amount of graves as he did the last town and double the amount of coin. But alas, he knew it was time to move on before suspicions were aroused. People running into dead men back in town wasn't good for business, especially ones he supposedly shot dead in the street under illusion of heated duel.

""Pleasure doing business with you, doc,"" said the traveler, shaking his hand and handing him his share.

""Indeed,"" he replied, jingling his coin purse proudly. ""Until next time.""

The traveler smiled. ""Don't think you'll be seeing me again, doc."" He mounted his horse, gave it a nudge and began making his way down the path.

Nearing the edge of the cemetary, the traveler's horse reared up in nervous fright. He reeled in on the reigns trying to calm the frightened animal but it was no use. It reared and bucked until finally the traveler was thrown. He hit the ground hard, knocking the wind out of him. He slowly got to his feet.

""God dam-"" started the traveler, his words stopping in the back of his throat. He tried to swallow them back down but the cold hand wrapped around his neck seized his ability. The traveler's eyes grew wide in terror and disbelief as he observed the tall, dark figure before him. The shadowy figure leaned in and spoke.

""Do you know who I am?"" his chilling voice inquired. He released his cold grip just enough for the traveler to answer.

""N-no.""

""You know who I am. I am Death. And you have cheated me. Your purse is full but my graves are empty.""

""Tell me how much you want! Tell me how much you need!""

"I have heard  stories in my childhood. 

How a black clothed man comes and takes away souls. 
How a man on a buffalo takes away souls. How a dressed up skull takes away souls.
How you have to sit on a boat to get to the other side of the river. 
How angels takes your hand and pulls you up to heaven. 

Lots of stories. 

What no one told me is that there is no black clothed man or buffaloes or angels. And no rivers to cross. 

When I slipped of the mountain into the forest down below, no one pulled my soul out of me. I fell with a thud on the ground and hit my head on a rock. It wasn't painful. All i heard was a thud and  shock on my head and that's it.  

Next thing I know I got up , looked behind. Saw my lifeless body over there. That was the moment of realization. 

I died. 

On 6th Jan 2020,I was going to depart to the other world.

But the most unexpected thing happened.

 I saw my friend running over to me. Wasn't she at her home?

She stands in front of me , like she normally  does but there is something different.
Her right arm had a strange tattoo . I had never seen the tattoo  before . Did she get inked in the afternoon?

""No"", she said. 

She can read my mind! 

Wait! She can see me? I died for god's sake.

 ""I am assigned to take you to your next life ""she said casually. 

Okay.What does this mean? Has she gone mad or did I? I am dreaming right? Nope. 

""Let me explain. Remember that accident near our school five years ago. I got hit by a truck and stayed in coma for an year. I made a pact with death , to cover the people near my locality. Anyone who dies, I will take them away. That's the price for keeping me alive. "" 

She was smirking directly at me. Believable.She was nice once but hasn't she become a b*tch now though?

I forgot she could read my mind. 

She lunged at me at full speed. I dodged. She hit a tree branch which pierced right into her heart. But she was alive. So much for immortality. 

She put her hand onto my hand,realising that even if she lives she will have to live like a corpse. Maybe she didn't want that. Was she going to take me with her?

I opened my eyes.

 I was in my room.

 Covered by my warm blanket. No blood.Nothing. The date on my phone showed 7th Jan 2020.

However downstairs my mom was concerned.

More caffeine.

Maybe it was a dream, but I can’t get the faces out of my mind. In that place with bright colors and weird animals. Neon colored buildings and nature all around me.
Bright green and yellow lizard like creatures with red eyes and sharp teeth chasing me around. My shoes were missing. They were biting at my ankles, they were fast like snakes. Cat sized frog like animals hopping all around me, they would squish and puff back out if you stepped on them. They were slimy.

I was running around confused trying to get away from these animals then I ran into the monster that was tearing into some of the buildings.

That thing saw me and now that thing was chasing me. I was terrified. It was like a cross between the Hulk and a yeti, with white and black fur.

Then I got to the yellow and black beach, the sky was cloudy and grey. Mist from the gray pale water. There were men in suits with sunglasses on. They looked human, but when they put those weird binoculars on me the 50 or so “people” in suits showed their true form. 

Orange Faces, huge Eyes, slits for a mouth and nose, smiling faces and 4 fingered hands with skinny arms and legs akin to typical green little men only they were orange, skinny and the height of your average human. Some had hair and some were bald. Some faces had wrinkles and there was variety in the beings appearance. Some faces were smooth. As if some were pure whatever-their-race-was and some of them were crossbred with humans. They were glad I was frightened. All smiling.Paralyzed in fear or perhaps they forced me to stay still. One gets close and injects me with something. I woke up. With a new scar.

That was last night. Not again.

Maybe that large meteor I saw last week wasn’t a meteor.

"She was standing there menacingly toward the wall. Perhaps, she was looking for something or someone. I reached for her shoulder but my heart said otherwise. I called her out but there was no answer. I felt like something was nearby her but there was nothing around her. I braced myself and touched her shoulder. A sudden flash blinded my eyes as I fell into a deep abyss.

As I kept falling into the abyss, the wall became wet and squishy. The air felt humid as they're thrusting through my body. A mix of smell between metallic and spoiled milk gone through my nose as I holding myself from throwing up. The wall was beating up and down and up and down as it kept pulsing. Lub. Dub. Lub. Dub. Lub. Dub. The sound continued until I hit the floor.

I woke up but couldn't move. I'm staring into the wall. I'm in her and she's in mine. She walked away with my body as I was left here, staring and waiting for someone to help me. Then, a man came by me. I can see him even if I can't move. He looks suspicious of me and called me out. I couldn't yell or even open my mouth. As he came closer to my body, I knew it will happen.

""Help me!"" He heard it right behind him. It sounded just like a human woman. He suddenly tripped out into a clearing, and saw the lights of a police cruiser parked along the old logging road. Shawn jumped to his feet, almost losing his balance again as he lurched forward and waved his hands.

""Hey! Over here!"" he yelled. He saw a flashlight start scanning around, looking for him.

Shawn didn't notice the long, decrepit fingers slide out from the shadows behind him. He was so relieved to see the cop car that he was taken completely by surprise when three fingers, at least a foot in length each, impaled him through the back and out his chest. They were thin, almost brittle looking. The hand closed around him and dragged him backwards into the woods with barely a sound.

The cop carefully made his way to the treeline. He was out there looking for a missing girl, but he heard a man's voice yelling to him. He had his gun drawn next to his large flashlight. He got to the spot he thought the voice came from and felt a chill as his flashlight fell on a pool of fresh blood.

""Hey!"" Shawn's voice called out again. ""Over here!"" The cop was startled at the sudden outburst, pointing his gun in the direction of the yelling. It was coming from somewhere in the trees.

""Over here!"" Shawn's voice yelled again.

The cop spoke into his radio. ""Possibly have injured on the scene, they're calling for help. Send EMS with the backup. I'm going to find them."" He waited for confirmation of his call before yelling into the woods.

""Hang on!"" yelled the cop. ""I'm a police officer! Keep talking to me, I'm coming to find you!""

The officer took a step into the dark woods, missing Shawn's mangled corpse slung a few yards up a pine tree, sprawled across the branches. Drops of blood steadily fell to the snow, missing the officer as his footsteps drowned out the quiet splashes.

""Over here!"" the voice yelled again, from deeper in the woods. A cloud shrouded the moon, and the only lights that broke the darkness were a lone flashlight in the forest and the blinking lights of a police cruiser, left running on the side of the road.",shortscarystories
"My phone started buzzing. I didn’t recognize the number but it was my area code. I answered.

“Hello?”

“Stand up!” The voice on the other end sounded like a little boy, choked and dry.

“Stand up! Run!”

“Who is this?” I asked.

“Stand up! Run!”

I leapt up from the park bench and paced forward into the muddy grass.

“Who is this?”

“Run!”

“Who is this?”

I was still walking forward into the grass when…crack!

Next thing I knew I was on my face in the mud. It took me a moment to turn onto my back, to wipe the mud from my eyes and look back at the bench where I’d sat, now a smoldering wreck under the twisted, steaming, jet turbine.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The ambulance took me to the hospital where I was treated for the steam burns on my neck and back. If only I had run…

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Two nights later I awoke to the sound of someone coming into my hospital room. I sat up and wiped the sleep from my eyes to see my mom standing in the doorway.

“Mom? What are you doing here it’s…it’s…”

I glanced at my phone on the bedside table.

“…1:00 AM”

She was looking all around the room. She stuck her neck out into the hallway.

“Where’s the nurse?” she asked. “Where’s the nurse? Where’s the nurse?”

“Mom?”

“No nurse?” She reached into the hallway and took hold of the doorknob. She pulled it shut.

“I’m supposed to leave the door open, mom.”

She sighed.

“No nurse.”

She sighed again and smiled. Her teeth were stained brown.

“Mom?”

Just then my phone rang. I reached for it on the bedside table. I glanced once more at my mom, her back to the door, then at my phone screen.

It was that same number…the one from the park…from the…

I answered.

“Hello?”

“It’s not your mom.” That voice again, the voice of a little boy, choked and dry.

“It’s not your mom. It’s not your mom!”

And I heard the voice repeat the warning over and over as I glanced up at that familiar face now twisting unfamiliar to reveal the blood-stained fangs at the back of her unhinging jaw.",shortscarystories
"I am in Hell.

Currently,  the screams of the damned have almost ceased. We lay still, or cower in  our holes, waiting for the next thing they will throw at us. Will it be  blight, sickness, fire from the sky? Will it make our lungs burn, our  skin shed, shred our flesh?

The  worst thing is, we chose to be here. When they came for us, they had  sweet discourses and multiple promises. They had the appearance of men,  but I am now sure that they are demons. No man would ever inflict such a  fate on his brother. We trusted them, followed them, and here we are.

I do not remember how much time passed since I came here. Seems like forever. Might just be a few days.

And  I lay here on the cold mud. A semblance of night is falling; I know it  will be pierced by flashes of light, fucking light that reveals our  silhouettes for torture like shadow puppets.

No  animal lives here. No bird song accompanies me on what feels like my  last moments. The pain is cruel; I can’t feel my shattered leg anymore,  but the hole in my guts pulse agony with every gush of blood my  fluttering heart sends across my body. The pain keeps me awake. I don’t  want to know what they will do to me if I sleep.

My  comrades betrayed me. I don’t blame them. I did the same. I left  friends to scream and implore and call to God, their mother and fate. I  left them so that I could escape, not expose myself to the terrible fate  of those caught in the open.

I think the demons grow fat on our suffering and betrayals and fear. That’s the only explanation I can see now.

My  brothers are a few feet away from me, cowering in a hole. My voice is  now but a whisper, pleading for them to come and get me. More to guilt  them than to convince them; I don’t think they could get far with me on  their backs. It’s only fair. We all had to hear the maddening pleas of  the dying.

I hear a low rumble, a  terrible voice that shakes the ground. The lights are here. It’s here.  Deliverance? Please, please make it stop. Let the enemy artillery  finally tear my body apart, let a German bayonet drill my brain and  excise all memory of this place from me.

Whatever is after death, I now know it can’t be worse than this place.",shortscarystories
"When I was a young boy of maybe 14, my grandfather owned a farm on the far outskirts of town. I loved it. Summers spent there were filled with joy and experience. The last night's I spent on that farm however, twisted my mind into believing things that should not be and terrified me to the point of never again returning. 

A night before the last one I spent on the farm, squeals raged in the early hours of the morning. The pigs had been going crazy, frightened perhaps, to the point of breaking out of their pen and running loose around the property. Armed with a .22 and my grandfather a shotgun, we patrolled the yard trying to gather the pigs we could. Approaching the pig pen I could hear rustling at the slop box. As I went to flash my light at the source, the deepest and hoarsest squeal of a pig pierced through my ears. I could feel the vibrations through the ground as this beast smashed a hole in the side of the pen and disappeared into the bushline. 

The morning after only brought more questions then answers. The first thing that was strange was the strength of the beast to break through the pen wall followed by the roar it had. But of all the strangness the night before had brought, by far the worst was the handprints in the mud of the pig pen. 

As the daily chores came to an end and we managed to gather the pigs into the barn, night approached. My grandfather and I waited. His theory was a pack of wild dogs had come through and disturbed the pigs. At some point we both fell asleep but were abruptly awoke by the sounds of the pigs once again squealing in insanity. Running towards the barn I was the first through the door. I saw that beast of a pig, it charged me and knocked me to the side, it charged with that hored squeal and what I could have swore to anything were hands of a human replacing its front hooves. As it raced passed I heard two shots fired from my grandfather's shotgun. He yelled in victory proclaiming he had made a hit to the beasts hip. I must have had a panic attack or perhaps momentarily went mad for I do not remember the hours that followed.

 I didnt have any words for my grandfather as to why I had my parents come get me the very next day. I feared he would never believe me. But the moment that started the twisting and turning in my stomach that for 70 years has never ceased was over hearing my mother in the kitchen telling my father about the passing of my grandfathers neighbour, police found her decaying body about 2 weeks after I left when family hadnt seen her around town. When my father asked what she died from, my mothers reply was from a hip fracture.",shortscarystories
"
Until.

Until the next dead tree, until the next big rock, just 15 more minutes... 

And when she walked past these goals, she walked even further. Her tired muscles screamed in protest, her body getting heavier and heavier. 

Every so often she heard a click, like one of a typewriter. A crack in her knees, or perhaps her ankles. Yet she continued walking. She had to find it. She had to be getting closer. 

She walked until her lungs burned, until her mouth dried and her lips cracked. Her heart was beating so fast it was painful. Water had run out some time ago. Food was but a memory. Yet she continued walking.

The sun bore down on her skin and the heat burned red spots even under fabric. The bright light turned her pupils to pinpricks, unable to shrink any smaller to protect her from the bright stinging light. She tilted her head down and kept moving. 

She walked past her hunger. Walked past that voice in her head that told her to give up. She walked past any whisper of conscious thought. It was all instinct from there, a need for survival.

To live is to go on. To go on is to live. So she went on until there was no more to go.

Jonathan reluctantly picked up the phone. He knew that at this hour, it could only be bad news. Blood rushed to his ears in anticipation. He knew, before any words were spoken, what had happened. He had expected this call for the last three years. Ever since his sister lost herself to her highs and lows. Either it would be a phone call, or a knock on his door, or maybe nothing if she died a homeless woman with no name. But he had to be sure. So he answered.

"“Daddy, what are we having for breakfast?” 

“French toast,” his voice quivered as he answered.

“Yipee! That’s my favorite,” Julia squealed as she jumped into her father’s lap.

“What are we doing today?” She asked as she planted a kiss on his cheek.

“The zoo,” he responded as he played with a lock on her hair.

“I can’t wait! Can I get a stuffed animal and funnel cake?” She quizzed, excited to be getting whatever she wanted today.

“Of course! Anything for my sweet little angel,” her fathered cried, unable to hold back his emotions.

“What’s wrong Daddy?” Julia whimpered.

“Today is the last day that you will be with us,” her father sniffled as he whipped away a strand of hair on Julia’s head.

“Where am I going?” Julia asked upset, but also curious.

“Daddy did a bad thing years ago, and for that, you must leave tonight. You see how large and lovely our home is? You see Daddy and Mommy on TV? You see all of the nice toys and games you have? Daddy made a promise years ago to someone in order to have these amazing things.”

Julia cocked her head to the side and stared at her father. “Where am I going?” She asked again.

Her father sighed and shook his head. “You are going to be going with a lovely man, one who will take care of you for the rest of your life. We will see each other one day, it isn’t forever.”

Julia screamed as her father spoke and wrapped her arms around his neck tightly. “I don’t want to go!”

“I know you don’t, baby girl. But, where you’re going, there will be tons of wonderful kids to play with. Ones who were taken from their parents as well. There will be all kinds of cakes, candies, and sweets for you to have any time you’d like!” Her father squeezed her roughly and patted her back. 

He understood that this was the last day of her little life, just shy of five years old. He will give her the greatest time she’s ever had, and then she must go. But, fear not, father will not lose all of his precious belongings. 

Her Mommy is pregnant again and once the child is of age, it will leave too.

"The winds of the Sahara still swirled dust in a show of graceful power. The typhoons of the Pacific roared ever faster towards land. People went about their routines, and the world settled into another seemingly uneventful day.

But then the reports started to flood in; slowly at first, but ever increasing as the day progressed and the panic increased. 

It was the agriculture community that noticed it first. Farmers awoke, each feeing a sense of unease, but unable to pinpoint its exact cause. This unease grew as they went about their daily routine, tending the fields, seeding new soil, and feeding the livestock. The more perceptive figured it out quickly, and began ringing the nearby farms to see if they were also experiencing the same thing.

The livestock had fallen silent. 

The herds of cows shuffled tentatively in rich fields of grass. Chickens walked aimlessly in their coup, devoid of any clucks or murmurs. Even the herding dogs nervously tended to their jobs, but without the usual barks and growls. 

In each of these small farming communities, eventually the police were notified. While the reports were shrugged off at first, the deputies grew visibly nervous when similar reports came flooding in from around the area. Deputies talked to sheriffs, who contacted governors, who quickly reached out to the White House. 

By then, the cities had noticed it as well. The birds didn’t sing, and beloved family pets had fallen silent. 

The real shocking news came when reports of identical events coming in from every continent. Animals in factory farms, zoos, both wild and domesticated had ceased to make any noise. Even the penguins of Antarctica had fallen silent. 

Soon, the only thing on the news was the mysterious force that silenced the cries of animals around the globe. Theories and rumors ran rampant through social media. Everything from a pandemic, to a coming solar flare, to the apocalypse. 

Mass exodus from cities began to occur and martial law was instated in countries around the world. The economy collapsed almost over night. It wasn’t long before we observed animals refusing to eat. In the following weeks herds of wild bison dropped dead in lush northern fields. Birds fell off of power lines, trees, and houses onto the ground below. Lakes and oceans soon became sweltering humid wastelands of dead floating fish. Families wept as mans best friend slowly wilted away in front of full food bowls. The world descended to anarchy. Stores were looted, fires consumed entire towns, and government intervention collapsed when soldiers left to find their families. 

And then, it came. Millions fell to their knees in terror when the trumpets echoed down from the heavens. The religious sat silent, awaiting judgement. The non believers also fell silent, fear gripping their hearts. 

And both sat silently dumbfounded together, as the long obelisk objects descended from the skies.",shortscarystories
"""Mom, why can't I go into the basement?"" That is the first thing I can remember speaking.  That phrase would be repeated throughout my childhood.  And every time I asked, I got the same response: 

""It's just not safe down there, so don't go down there."" And that was that. Nothing more, nothing less. I accepted that theory in my younger years. I didn't think it was very unusual at the time. I wasn't very outgoing at a child, and many things scared me, so, I had no desire to go down there when I was younger.

I only ever got suspicious of what was down in that basement until I was 13. I still remember that night vividly. It was a rather normal night. I was reading a book in my bed and listening to music. Usually, my mom would enter my room at about 9:30 and would tell me to go to sleep, but that didn't mean I did. Well, that night I was reading and I realized that it was about 10:15, and my mother hadn't told me to go to sleep. That didn't stop me from reading but after about another   15 minutes or so, my mother entered my room. 

""Hey bud, it's time to go to bed, and no leaving your room tonight."" Last night, I had left bed to eat a snack, and my mother still believes I was trying to sneak out. 

""Okay, mom."" I simply answered as I turned out the lights. 

""Goodnight bud."" My mother said as she closed the door. 

I had trouble falling asleep. I don't know why, but I didn't feel sleepy at all. But I soon lost all hope of sleep when I began to hear muffled screams coming from my basement.  After a couple of minutes, I decided to leave the room, when I left, I realized that the basement door was open, this disturbed me so much, I ran back into my room and stayed there for the rest of the night. 

The next morning, I questioned my mother, but she denied everything and chalked everything up to nightmares. So that day, while my mother was at work, I picked the lock of the basement door with a paperclip and a pair of pliers.  When I walked down the stairs, I found a tall creature, with a disfigured face scratching the walls. I quickly ran upstairs and locked the door.

A month later, my mother committed suicide. as the police searched the house, they opened the basement door and found several bodies, the most recent of which was a tall man, whose face had been bashed.",shortscarystories

"Family walks bored me, and I hated that it was always the beach even though my mum knows I despise the feeling of sand under my feet, getting into my shoes and inevitably into my socks, sitting between my toes and just sticking.

So I stayed off the sand. I walked the rocks. The jagged rocks, the ones that had small pools between each rise and fall and shelled creatures clinging to each face of their shapes. As always I was shouted at by my mother who told me it was dangerous, that I'd slip and smack my head but it beat the sand anyday. She turned frustrated as I carried on.

Following the bolts of higher rock which I walked so intently led me away without my knowing and I found myself swallowed up in the shadow of a rocky mouth. As the rocks tamed and their mountains became stunted they made way downwards towards a wide area of smooth sand.

This sand was different.

It looked the same but the grains rolled over each other and sank down back into the mass as if adjusting for a shift beneath it, and for once I desperately wanted to feel the sand on my feet, between my toes and stuck to me, slightly damp. I needed to.

As if possessed, I threw my shoes off, then my socks and tip toed into the sand gently, feeling the grains flow over me as if I was part of it and being welcomed. Silent I stood, eyes closed, embracing the peculiar feeling with no other thoughts crossing my mind.

The sound of waves crashing just a few metres behind me stopped and so did the wind. I noticed but I didn't care. Warm water rose a millimetre at a time between my toes, until it covered my feet and lapped at my ankles.

When I opened my eyes I saw the water was dark. Almost opaque but for some tiny lights sat amongst it like dull fireflies. A tide befiitting the size of the body of water picked up, me at the epicenter and the lights being dragged towards me. This is when I realised I couldn't move a single part of me. Their touch stang like licks of a flame and they kept coming, numbers multiplying.

Lights stopped. Water black.

The sand just dropped, and took me with it, falling through the liquid as though weights were tied to my body. Falling I saw things that I couldn't comprehend. Creatures so alien I couldn't understand anything more than their size and their shape in the most vague understanding and I felt a crater of fear form in my stomach as though my most base instincts knew what was happening.

I felt sand on my feet again as I stopped moving. It flew to me, rolled over my toes and up my legs, sticking to me, stinging me until it enveloped me. It climbed into my nostrils grating against my delicate skin and my soft insides. Grains rolled under my eyelids and around my eyeballs and furled under my fingernails.

It sat in the far corner; the light barely even touching it. On closer inspection, it depicted an imposing gallery with whitewashed walls portraying beautiful works.

"What a steal, he thought. Man, his daughter would love it. He's been seeing these around town as of late and his kid, like most, wanted to jump on the new trend.

He looked down at the doll again. 'Jane', the small black scrawl on her shoe said. Those rosy cheeks, that glossy black hair, those bright green eyes... they all seemed to have a semblance of life. 

He looked up and saw people leaving their homes. Each of them were carrying a doll in their arms, and some had a doll in their front windows.  The plastic eyes seemed to follow him from every direction.

None of the dolls had the same jet black hair or emerald eyes as his did. He felt proud... until he saw everyone on the street watching him. They were looking at his doll. 

In unison, the throng of people whispered, ""Jane...""

The man slowed down his gait, unsure of what was expected of him. His grip on Jane faltered a little.

Then the quiet neighborhood quickly turned into a mob as they all rushed him, beat him senseless, and bound him. 

He awoke tied to a stone slab in the woods. There were torches everywhere, giving the surroundings a soft glow. Robed figures were chanting all around him. He shook the sweat from his eyes and glanced about. 

Dolls. They were sitting in the circle of chairs encompassing him. In the trees. On the floor. They were everywhere, and they all seemed to be looking at him. Their beady eyes gleamed in the light of the fire. 

Then he saw Jane. She was placed by his feet.

The robed figures stopped chanting and pulled out curved daggers which gleamed wickedly in the light.

""He was carrying Jane. Jane has chosen him!""  they cried as one. 

In a single motion, they stepped toward the man on the stone altar. His cries were cut off as a dagger slit his throat and others punctured his chest and lungs.

I love the smiles on peoples faces.  I love them laughing walking up and down the street. I love to see families: mothers and fathers holding hands with their children with joy.  These people don't understand the real world. They don't understand the dangers lurking in the shadows. They don't understand the fear that they should revel in.

I love to wake people up to the truth.

I was walking through the downtown district of my city. It was a wet day but not quite raining. Everyone was covered in coats and umbrellas. Most people today looked gloomy. This put me in a bad mood, until I saw her.

She was holding hands with a little girl in a pink raincoat.  She was wearing a red one herself. They were the only two on the street with bright smiles. So I followed them. Their bright colors and bright smiles could not be missed on such a gloomy day. They stood out in whatever crowd they passed through.

I followed them for two blocks before I finally approached them. I politely asked them for directions.  She smiled at me and said ""good day"".  She was so pretty and tall. The little girl's smile faded from her face as she looked up at me.  I asked if I could take a shortcut through the nearest alley.  She said she never had but probably. I walked to the alley's entrance and said ""this way?"".  They both approached to peer into the narrow lane.  

In a moment when no one was looking, I grabbed their hands and dragged them into the alley.  I took a brief moment to watch their faces change.  The shock.  The FEAR!  The pitiful indignance.  My work was over almost as quickly as it had begun.  They were both covered in red, but not because of their raincoats.  I quickly slid away happy with the work that I'd done.

I love laughing faces.  I love those people who walk the city with bright smiles. I love to change them.  I hope you're one of those people.

By the end of it, when she couldn't even stand up or eat, she still resented me.

I sometimes think that was the last part of her to die. That her hatred was the only thing keeping her alive by that point.

The doctors had pumped her full of drugs in an attempt to ease her passing. They said she wouldn't even be conscious; wouldn't feel a thing anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

For hours she stared at the roof with a blank stare, as if she were looking at something that she did not understand and could not explain.

It was when I grabbed her hand that she seemed to come back from wherever she had gone; back to the room with me.

She looked me in the eye, and I know she would've spat in my face had her body not given in to the disease already.

She never had to say a word.

All she had to do was look at me, and in her eyes I could see that she was laughing at my tears.

Everyday I am weighed down by the realization that I hurt you.

&amp;#x200B;

A kiss on the cheek.

&amp;#x200B;

To be treated like you were my son.

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't your fault, it never was.

All you wanted was love, like any other human being.

&amp;#x200B;

But I never learned to give love.

Just like my father didn't know how to either.

So I reach to you now.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not asking for your love.

For redemption.

Wounds may heal, but they always leave a scar.

Please, my son.

&amp;#x200B;

Forgive me.

&amp;#x200B;

Only then will I know that I managed to do some good.

That among all the filth and grime, there is at least a memory you hold dear.

I need to know that it isn't all hate.

I’m sorry.

I’m so sorry.

"ERR 0059879: CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE
RUNNING DIAGNOSTICS…

REALITY PROCESSING: OKAY

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: OKAY

TIME-SPACE CONTINUITY ENGINE: OKAY

REALITY ANCHOR CORE: FAILING

ERROR MESSAGE:

If you are reading this, that means something has gone horribly wrong, so I'm going to get right to the point. You may have already had your suspicions, but the world around you isn't real. It's a huge simulation, perfect and immaculate down to the tiniest microscopic life form, designed to keep you occupied while your immortal body sits around for eons. You can't leave once you enter, but you knew that. You agreed to it, signed your eternity away to living out countless lives one after another rather than sit and do nothing for forever. An admirable decision.

But the system is falling apart.

This error message means that the world you know is coming to an end. The rules of the reality you have spent countless lives in are not so slowly becoming irrelevant, and strange, inexplicable things are happening more and more. Monsters in the dark, strange places with strange rules, people going mad and committing horrible, inhuman atrocities, and soon, the collapse of physics and space as you know it. You may have already seen it. You may have encountered a glitch already. Your reality has come unhinged. 

As for what you can do to stay safe, here are some general rules that alter the system slightly so that reality is a little more stable in a given area:

Always make sure the door latches when you leave a room and close it, even if you're coming right back. It reduces rendering for you, so there's less room for a Glitch to occur.

If you encounter a strange door or room in your house, DO NOT ENTER. Leave the house, close and lock the door, wait for at least twenty seconds for the house to refresh, and then you can go back inside. If the door is still there, ignore it until you go to sleep.

If something is following you and it doesn't sound human, do not look back. Audio Glitches will be common, but they can only solidify into a physical entity if you acknowledge them.

If you see strange flowers growing in places they shouldn't, such as on a wall, in the sidewalk, indoors, etc, gently touch each of the five petals ONCE, and then pick the flower. These are what amounts to recalibration points, and will reset the reality in a 50 meter radius. If you do this improperly, it will worsen the reality collapse.

DO NOT PRACTICE WITCHCRAFT OR ANY OTHER FORM OF MAGIC. They directly interfere with the code, and may contribute to reality collapse in your area. This includes, but is not limited to, voodoo, hexes, arcane study, alchemy, etc.

Finally, but most importantly, if you see or hear about or read about something inexplicable and horrible happening… Believe it. Follow the rules. Your life depends on it.

The action of remembering, hurt, and most times he just ignored trying. His memory only seemed to go as far as last year; shall another year pass, he may forget the previous one he used to recall. It was irritating, but he had learned to move on. Each day was new, as they said. But it all seemed the same to him. Wake up, go to work, go home. Rinse and repeat.

"Without wincing, he leaned down to kiss her now swollen face. She whispered something, maybe it was 'I’m sorry' or 'I love you'. Whatever she said, it was low and I couldn’t quite make it out.

I turned away from watching and slunk back from the door. Her soft sobs followed me all the way back to my bed.

As I lay down, I couldn’t stop thinking of the look on her face. The pain on it stuck with me.

She didn’t want to be with him. She deserved so much better. I knew she shouldn’t stay with such a sorry excuse for a man.

Maybe next time, she’ll learn. **If not, I’ll have to teach her again.**",shortscarystories
"“Oh, you are back.” The shadow crept from behind the curtain with an arrogant leer on its face. I always hated its ugly face but right now I wanted to smack it with something hard and heavy.

“Fuck Off, I do not want to talk to you.” I barked back with all the crippling strength I had left inside me.

Tsk… Tsk… Tsk…

“Such… Arrogance, for someone who has no friends, who is going to die alone.” It snarked at me, stepping closer. I was at the brink of tears but I did not want to break down in front of it again. That is how it wins over me. That is how I lose this game.

“I do not have friends because of YOU!” I sneered.

“Hah! You have me BECAUSE you do not have friends” It chortled back at me.

With a brooding face, I tried to ignore it and pretended to focus on my computer screen in front of me.

“How’s your job search coming along? Any progress?” It put its hands on my shoulders and I felt uneasy but did not dare to shake it off.

“None of your concern.” I grimaced.

“Ho Ho Ho,” His chuckle hurt me like daggers. “It is of my utmost concern petty human. Because in your failures augments my survival and I am ever thankful to you for keep doing so.”

“CAN YOU PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE FOR FIVE MINUTES?” I bellowed as tears dribbled down my eyes.

“NO! You can escape the whole world - you pathetic sack of unworthiness - but you CANNOT escape me! I am your truth. I am your identity. I am your loneliness. I AM YOU!” It growled back with mirth gazing down my eyes. The whole world laughed in his eyes.

“So, you think I would never find anybody to replace you?” I asked bleakly, my voice broke in the middle of the question.

The shadow burst into a fit of laughter. His derisive gaze mocked the naivety of my question. I stared at it till it was done, it was nothing new to me, I had become used to it, a long time ago.

But today, I was going to do something about it. Today I was seeking an end. So, I started writing.

“What new filth are you writing now? Nobody likes your stories just like they do not like you.” The shadow jeered.

“It is not a story, it is a cage, a vessel to hold you within.”

“What?” He chortled. “And, you think this will work?”

“We shall see,” I said as I typed enthusiastically for the first time in ever. “Because I am sending you to find the one that will kill you.”

“You can not do that.” He retorted despondently.

“I am doing it.” I beamed. “Now go, find me someone who will accept me for who I am.”

And thus, I trapped my loneliness in this story. I hope it will find its destination one day.",shortscarystories
"I kneeled before what I believed was God as he judged me.

 ""I know thee not, step away from my kingdom."" 

Then a deep, rumbling voice from behind asked a question that made my heart sink.

 ""Oh, does that mean your soul belongs to me?"" 

I was increasingly apologetic for my sins. I was plunged into a large, bright white room. No furniture, no decorations, nothing. I instantly new what was happening and I begged and cried for God to call me into his kingdom. 

It's been 40,000 years, and no luck pleading with the Almighty. Pray for us in Hell, we need it more than ever.",shortscarystories
"“Three flashes?” Mel rose from her armchair next to the fire. “That can’t be right.”

“Three flashes,” I repeated, lowering the binoculars from my eyes. Without aid, I could just make out the tiny pinpoints of light blinking from the tower across the bog. Mel came to stand beside me at the living room window, and I passed the binoculars to her. “Take a look.”

Mel raised the binoculars to her eyes and focused on the top of the tower. Her forehead scrunched up in confusion. “Yeah, you’re… you’re right, Kat. Three flashes. But what does that mean?” 

“I have no idea.” 

Mel removed the binoculars to look at me directly. “They told us about the lights when we moved into this house, right? Part of a coded warning system, for severe weather or something. One flash for danger. Two flashes for safe. Right?” 

“Right,” I said.

“But they never told us what three flashes meant.”

“Never.” 

Mel pursed her lips. “I don’t like this. I don’t like this at all.”

“I guess we should assume it means danger,” I said, putting my arm around Mel’s shoulders. “I mean, there’s no harm in being cautious, right?”

“I guess,” she said. But she peered through the binoculars once more, fiddling with the focus dial on top. “It’s just so odd to me. Why couldn’t they stick with the system?”

“No idea.” 

I kissed Mel’s cheek and left her standing at the living room window while I went to deadbolt the front door. She stayed there, looking through the binoculars, while I checked the locks on all the windows in the house. Kitchen windows locked, bedroom windows locked, living room windows locked, bathroom windows… 

Broken glass covered the bathroom floor. The window was shattered, and only jagged edges remained in the window frame. A warm breeze blew in through the window. Sickeningly warm, with a smell to match; the warm smell of the depths of the bog.

“Kat?” I heard Mel’s voice coming from the living room. “There’s something weird about these flashes. They’re… different frequencies, I think.”

“Oh,” I called back. The bog smell was overpowering. I staggered backward, and the broken glass crunched under my heel. As I peered through the empty space that was once our bathroom window, I saw a pair of white eyes staring back at me. I heard something snarl.

“Yeah,” Mel said. “They’re… three short flashes, then three long, then three more short flashes. And it just keeps repeating, over and over.”

"It was Sunday, October 12. A fine afternoon, but unfortunately, I didn't get to spend it outside. My supervisors had me work that day. I didn't blame 'em, really. Social work doesn't pause for the weekend.

Annie was 25, but she didn't act like it. My boss said she was mentally disabled. She said she was (and I hate to use this word) ""retarded.""

""Hi, Annie,"" I said. ""I'd like to talk to you about your mom and dad. You know why you're here, right?""

""Mommy hits me,"" she said. ""That's why I'm here."" Straight to the point, but I didn't mind.

""I know, Annie. They told you they'd give me your file, remember?"" She nodded before I continued. ""Do you know why your mom hits you? How often does it happen?""

""Mommy hits me 'cause I'm retarded,"" she said. ""She hits me near every day.""

""Annie, I want you to understand that it's not your fault. You're not the one making your mom hit you,"" I said. She just stared at me. Her eyes weren't blank, but I couldn't really tell what emotion they were showing. ""Is there anything that usually happens before she hits you?""

""Mommy hits me when she drinks whiskey. She comes in my room and hits me at night.""

I nodded as I wrote down what she said. ""What about after?""

""Does it gotta be always?""

""No.""

""Sometimes Mommy goes to Mommy's Room and cries after she's done hitting.""

I hoped she didn't think I was frowning at her.

""Does your mom yell at all?""

""Yeah, when she hits me sometimes she'll yell,"" she said. ""She says she's doing this 'cause I'm retarded. She says why won't you listen to me even though I do listen I just don't understand everything so good. Or if I mess something up like drop a glass she'll start yelling.""

I wanted to console Annie. Tell her it wasn't her fault. I just couldn't find the words. ""Is there anything else you want to tell me about your mom?""

Annie shook her head.

""Let's talk about your dad, then. Does he hit you?""

""Daddy never ever hits me. He says he loves me too much.""

I nodded. ""Any yelling or touching?""

""He hugs me every night. And he helps me take my medicine.""

Wait. There weren't any prescriptions on her case file. ""Your medicine?""

She didn't respond.

""What's your medicine for?""

""Daddy says not to tell anyone about my medicine.""

""What's your medicine for, Annie? Please tell me. We need to know.""

"I have just moved into a new apartment building. It’s in a small town and these people seem to be pretty close. The man who lives above me asked me to take him to the drug store. I did it once and now it’s a thing we do every Saturday. The lady who takes care of the building often drops off leftovers by my doorstep for no other reason that she thinks I don’t eat enough. She sure loves to take care of me. 

But a curious new woman has move in. She is a plain woman. She has a few friends that come by every now and then. I don’t think she has a boyfriend since any man who comes by is never alone and he often leaves with the people he came with. This woman is very clean. She doesn’t eat the food that the land lady leaves on her doorstep. I am told she doesn’t want to eat food from someone else because she is a germaphobe. I am also told that when one of our neighbors gave the whole apartment building gifts for Christmas, this woman threw hers in the garbage without even looking into it. It was a box of chocolates. I tried to say that she may be diabetic or watching her weight but, its still not nice to throw it away while still in the wrapping paper. 

I have taken it upon myself to invite everyone over dinner tonight. A little get together to celebrate my promotion at work. I expected everyone to show, except for her. I thought she wouldn’t show, however, I invited her anyway. I thought she might like to be invited still, and it was truly just an empty gesture. However, she actually showed up. 

She was the first one to show up in fact. I was a good host. I took her coat, I showed her to the finger foods, and offered her a glass of wine. Before long, the other members of the apartment started coming in. We exchanged pleasantries and told stories of the old days. This woman didn’t leave my side. I thought maybe she was into me. I was a bit flattered. 

As the party died down, ‘she’ took me aside to talk to me. We stepped out onto the balcony and she said a few words. 

“I know what you are. I’ve seen the marks on their necks. It’s a shame really, because you do seem to be one of the functioning ones.”

I tilted my head, “I don’t quite understand.”

“Spare me”, she smirked, “Its easy to slowly bleed 30 people than to hunt down a new one every night.”

She walked back into the party and I noticed that everyone inside was on the floor. Unconscious. She stood there, smiling, with her her silver daggers. I followed her in and locked the door behind me.

"The world is a cruel place. It has all the time to take everything from you.  But when it's time to give back, it just doesn't proceed.

"It's been eight months since the incident and I'm still hearing sirens in my sleep. 

It was a Thursday evening; I came home from work to an empty house. My wife Lena's clothes and phone weren't missing. Her cell phone sat abandoned on our counter; vibrating with calls and notifications. 

The only thing signifying that she hadn't been abducted was her missing car. 

I hadn't even completed all three numbers of 911 when police officers came to my door. Our neighbor Janice stood behind them; eyes rimmed red with tears. She had asked Lena to pick her son Thomas up from school due to a work emergency; meaning he was also missing. 

They questioned Janice and I repeatedly over the following weeks to no avail. We knew less than they did. No one wanted our loved ones home more than we did. 

Janice and I got the answers we asked for about two months later, but they weren't the ones we wanted. Lena's car was found burned up; crushed like a tin can. Someone saw a set of tire tracks heading off the mountainside and called it in once they saw the wreckage at the bottom. 

This New Year's Eve, I finally got the courage to try to remove the last of Lena's clothes from the house. The closet had been cleared, leaving only the items she kept in the linen trunk. I painstakingly packed up her favorite skirts, dresses and shoes. My heart felt emptier with every new item I removed from it. 

My heart broke to find a heart shaped box at the bottom, one I'd never seen before. A tag was taped atop it; my name scrawled across it in red ink. There was no lock; no key to be found. Only a simple, metal clasp kept me from the last gift my wife would ever give me. 

My fingers fumbled to open it in a frenzied anticipation. The endless possibilities of her love called to me from inside. Once it opened, I felt my soul freeze and then shatter. Tears ran down my face as I punched our closet walls until my knuckles bled. 

Laid inside, was a simple scrap of bloodied paper. A set of latitude and longitude coordinates ( which I found led to the same mountainside her car was found at the bottom at)  was written on it in my wife’s handwriting; along with a message. 

*Dear Tobyn,*

Somewhere quiet in the woods, a cabin where I'd stay, 
Where the noise would never find me, and the police cannot pursue me,

"It'd been about three months since I moved to the new place. It was certainly better than the last one  - til' the third month atleast. The place was peaceful and quiet, the air fresher and the people were helpful and kind. However, the weather was pretty unpredictable.

I like running. I'd run at the park every night for atleast an hour. There were quite a few runners there who sort of accompanied me by running at that hour of the night. I was acquainted with a couple of them by having ""what a nice night to go for a run"" conversations. Some ran alone, some with dogs and some were there to get some fresh air.

I like coffee. I'd drink at the coffee place owned by some lovely grandmas. They made delicious cakes and brewed some strong coffee. They used to tell me stories about the various celebrities that had visited there. Although,I knew the stories were fake, I'd still listen to them chatter.

I like night clubs and bars. All bars here had good music, good alcohol and were full of guys and girls ready to ""experiment"". They can call it whatever they want, I called it an easy way to get laid. Something I noticed later was how boring it gets when it's that easy. I soon got a girlfriend, suzie. We got very close very quick.

The second month I noticed something strange. The weather fluctuated every other day. One day it'd just rain, the other would be very sunny, thunderstorm the next and moderate after that and then this cycle continued. It was pretty impressive to see the runners running on such conditions. I started seeing less of the grandmas from the coffee shop and assumed they must be resting at their homes. They were old after all. I stopped going to the bars and night clubs after I met suzie and we were ""soulmates"" as she put it. She was just as beautiful as the blue moon we used to look at everynight.

The third month was chaos. The runners would run even in extreme weather conditions. The dogs would run in two legs just like their owners and go on for like that for 2-3 hours. The grandmas from the coffee shop started serving each other's head , feet and arms instead of cakes. I used to find hair and eyeballs inside the coffee mugs. My girlfriend suzie had a weird deformed thing on her stomach that almost looked like a face. Everyone on the streets started glitching into pixels and out of existence and then pixels and into existence. I knew what was happening.

The codes failed me again. The simulation wouldn't work more than 3 months due to my faulty codes.

* I took a deep breath*

I was fine with the runners, the dogs, the eyeballs in my coffee and the strange face on the belly of my ""girlfriend"". But they all were malfunctioning now and I had to end this world as well.

* I sighed and deleted the world*

It's been 5 months since I deleted my last world. I just got myself a coffee from starbucks (the servers spelled my name wrong btw) and i'm coding the next version of

"You may not believe it, but two hours is a lot of time. In two hours I could bake a cake or pizza or even both.

In two hours you could start a relationship, end one or make it better. In two hours you could become a parent or be sad you missed out on the process of becoming one.

Anything could happen in two hours. Any measure of great things. your life could become infinitely better, shit Jesus could even return if that floats your boat.

But in two hours any number of bad things could happen as well. Your house could burn down, your lover could cheat on you. Your piece of deliciously rich and thick chocolate cake could fall before you get to eat it. The bank you're in could become a hostage situation.

You can do a lot of things in two hours. Like be forced to your knees at gunpoint, and listen to the list of rules thieves set so no one gets shot. Accidents can happen in two hours too. The teller could accidentally get shot. A suicidal man could announce he wants to die and bite the throat of one of the robbers out. You could be stuck in a situation you don't want to be in.

You can do a lot of thinking in two hours too. Thinking of how you can escape. If you'll be shot, or how your pregnant fiance would take your death. Even what your funeral would be like, and the chance that there may be nothing after this life.

In two hours things can get tense. The police can roll up, so can a swat van. In two hours they can get a F.B.I negotiator to town. In two hours you could be the hostage the robbers say they will shoot if their demands aren't met.

In two hours, the police could fail to meet those demands.",shortscarystories
"Mitchell stared intently at me from across the small table, swirling his wine glass rapidly. The deep burgundy liquid threatened to spill over its edges. He informed me we were due for a romantic dinner, but Mitch, as usual, turned obsessively to his favorite topic and was now talking too loudly with that possessed gleam in his eye. The flickering candlelight skipped across his thin features, causing twitching shadows that made him look like a deranged rodent. 

“You see what I mean though, Dear?” He said. “Surely you see what I mean that frightening someone to death is not only possible, it is an exacting art? Why I’ve got a plan all worked out. I’m rather keen to try it.
Here now, look at me go on carelessly though. You might tell someone, mightn’t you? Here, let’s have some wine and forget all this scare talk.” 

I said nothing. He picked up the bottle of cabernet and added a splash to my untouched glass, then a healthy glug to his own. He took a deep swallow. 

“There. Isn’t that better?”

I said nothing. 

“My my, you’re the quiet one tonight. Cat got your tongue.”

It wasn’t a question. It was a declaration. That morning I’d awakened to find my tongue removed and though my heart hammered violently in shock and terror, I couldn’t even scream. I’d been nearly frightened to death. But not quite. He thought feeding the cat in front of me and then casually declaring it was my tongue would do the trick. It hadn’t. 

While I missed being able to speak, it was my arms I missed the most. Awakening to find body parts missing was of course pure unadulterated terror. Not quite enough to frighten me to death, although I prayed that it would.",shortscarystories
"When it all started I remember being outside and it was around quarter past nine when I first thought something was up. You see, usually about that time of day the town’s only starting to wake up and the only remotely busy place in our sleepy valley town would be the McDonalds by the highway. So to be woken up by practically the whole neighbourhood scrambling to get out of dodge was ‘surreal’ to put it lightly. Everyone as far as I could see, their silhouettes moved like panicked deer. This made it even hotter than it actually was on the day; mind you it was already at 69F by 9:00AM if I recall.

I just stood there as the Lorenzos drove right out of our little cul-de-sac with all of their cars to God knows where, into the fog. Following them were the McGreggors in their big red ute, the Smiths and then the Preasans. At least the Preasans were kind enough to shout a “Get the fuck outta here dude!” At me as they drove past. That’s when the first plane made a flyby. Goddamn it was loud but it wasn’t a fighter jet. It looked more like a passenger jet but it wasn’t that too I really couldn’t make it out in the fog. All I could remember was it was headed for the Woodland Hills. 

Through all that my neighbour, old man Lorraine, was out and about like it was a normal Sunday morning. I could tell it was him even through all that fog. Don’t ask me how, I just could. He was the old guy next door from me and he had the look like he was about to go to war with the garden hose he was holding. Watering the plants and his house. That’s when he saw me and instead of the usual rotten scowl he would give me on my morning jogs, he gave me the look like I was a kid who just lost his mom at a supermarket. 

That’s when I noticed the hazy fog. Don’t get me wrong the fog had been here for a whole week now but it was thicker and it was like a warm yellow. As in I could barely see three doors down over the ‘orangey’ haze. Then it hit me like a freight truck; it’s finally here. Yeah we’ve heard it all over the news. How it started up North out of state. How it jumped three Interstates, cutting that whole state in half. Now it’s crossed the state line into our doorstep. It was finally coming to my town. I’m ashamed to say it took me that long to realise it but by the time I did I could see that vast endless black plume of smoke cresting the hills into my town.",shortscarystories
"Nobody knows how or why they came, but the parasites first appeared on Christmas Eve. Millions of children woke up on Christmas morning to find their parents either dead or dying on the ground, being devoured from the inside.

News broke out quickly. The parasite bred their children through eggs- and they made *lots* of eggs. And in order to spread, their children needed food. So the parasites skittered into supermarkets and laid one, single, practically undetectable egg inside as much food as they could find. Containers didn't stop them; cans didn't stop them. 

But their children did not eat the food.

*We* did.

Once eating the eggs, they spontaneously hatched inside of us, and the child found plenty of food to eat. The parasites started off practically microscopic at first, but they grew the more they ate. 

And the damage grew, too. Soon, the baby would start to tear through our organs, ripping apart everything they could find and only eating what it liked; the heart. The parasite finding the heart hurts enough, but being literally eaten alive from the inside was a pain that nobody should've had to go through.

Everyone figured out how to avoid the parasites quickly; we just couldn't eat. The world would have to starve if they wanted to stay alive.

And so food stores closed down. Farms closed down. If we wanted to survive, we could not eat.

But it's easier said than done.

People didn't last a week; some people couldn't even last a day. They were oh, so hungry. They brought food from the last remaining food stores, ate it, and died. Some people who realized that death was inevitable just killed themselves to get it over with. And of course, people inevitably died from starvation.

Because if you ate, you died.

And so, so many people died.

Here I am, a survivor. My stomach groans every few minutes now. I've grown so skinny that my ribs poke through my skin. And the pain is unbearable.

But in my hand, I hold a single apple.

And I'm hungry.

Without hesitation, I bit into the apple with a loud crunch, and waited for the pain to begin.",shortscarystories

" 

My wife and I kept getting into more fights recently.

Her complaint is that I don't smile enough.

And sadly, I have to agree.

It's almost like I'm physically unable to smile nowadays.

So I talked to some people who could help me with that and wouldn't you know it.

One of them had a solution.

Plastic surgery.

I was skeptical at first, didn't want to ruin a beautiful face you know.

However the surgeon convinced me that he could make me smile again.

The surgeon said it with such conviction that I just simply couldn't imagine him being wrong.

My wife was against it but I hope that she will realize in the end that my happiness is important for me.

So I took a leap of faith.

And hell was it expensive.

But in the end I can not deny thatI got results.

It took him hours, drawing large cuts through flesh and muscles.

It was really messy, blood splattered into my eyes and I had trouble staying conscious.

However in the end I can say it was worth it.

Because thanks to the plastic surgery to the face I can finally smile again.

Because now, everytime I look at my wife,

Everytime I look at those ugly slashes and cuts on her ruined face.

I just burst out in laughter.",shortscarystories
"I lay in bed, looking tenderly at my wife. 'Wife', haha... It felt so surreal, especially since we'd just gotten married a week ago. I still wasn't used to the change, and I still expected to wake up from a happy dream, tasting the bitter threads of regret as it drifted away like smoke and mirrors. My hand reached out, fingers gently brushing her hair out of her face and behind her ear, letting my hand rest on her face. I'd never felt so happy in my life, except one week ago when I was on one knee and she'd started crying before letting out an airy ""Yes!""

Turning over, I lay on my back looking up at the ceiling. The clock ticked away, and it was so late I knew I should have been asleep; but I couldn't take the stupid grin off my face, and I didn't want to. Suddenly, I heard a rapping at the door, that unique way only my wife knocked. There was a moment of confusion before her voice drifted in from outside. ""Hey, you mind opening the door? Got a little bogged down with work, sorry!"" I felt my blood slowly freezing into chunks of ice. A visceral feeling of terror gathered in my gut, forming a ball of lead so heavy it felt like I could have thrown up right there. I was frozen stiff, and I almost couldn't make myself turn my neck to look at my wife who was right beside me. Maybe I would have felt better if she'd turned into a demon, or even vanished - but no, she was still there. Still very much my wife. And yet, the voice from outside was too perfect to be an imitation. The intonation, the style of speaking, everything was perfect. I knew it was her, just as I knew that the person beside me was also her. And yet, I knew one of them must be fake.

The terror had congealed into an icy mass that kicked my senses into overdrive. I slowly got out of bed before backing towards the wall. My phone let out a soft chime, and I pulled it out to read the text my wife just sent me. 

""Hey, I don't think I can get home till morning - We ran into some backlog issues that require me to stay and go through the archives, typing out the entire database again for the past few weeks 🤢 I'll make it up to you tomorrow, promise ;)

"For James, it was another completely normal day. Go to work. Go to lunch. Get hit on by that girl from Accounting. Go home. Waste the rest of the day away on the internet before going off to bed. But as he went to lay up, with his trusty lab by his side, he stopped noticing something stuck underneath her collar. A red piece of paper. A note. Or what should have been a note. This paper stuck underneath the collar was blank. James tossed it in the recycling without a second thought. When he woke up the following morning, that same red piece of paper was sitting on his nightstand. He picked it up to see it wasn’t blank this time. “Good Morning, James,” it read. James lived alone, so this put him on edge. He continued about his morning routine trying to get that note out of his mind. He was a little extra careful around the closets, fearing someone, or something, was hiding there, thinking that someone had to put the note on his stand. He finished his routine and went off to work. It was another normal day. But he still had that note stuck in his head. The red paper with unnaturally white writing was burned in the back of his mind. He didn’t tell anybody about it and just tried to get it out of his mind as much as possible. As he drove home that night after work, something was off. He had driven down this road so many times, but something was different. But he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. Then, it struck him and his heart sunk. All the billboards he was passing were red. Blood red. Then, the road signs started turning red right before his very eyes. He started breathing heavily and darting his eyes to every sign in sight praying to God that they weren’t red. But they were. They all were. He didn’t see any writing at first, but it soon started to come into focus. He passed a sign that only said “Good.” Then, another only saying “Night.” As he looked for another sign, his car crashed, flipping several times before eventually coming to a stop. James, dazed and upside down, looked around struggling to get free. He stopped suddenly, realizing there was one more sign in front of him that simply read “Forever.”",shortscarystories
"It started off like any other cliche family camping trip. My dad cursing as he attempted to set up the tent. My Mother sitting quietly by without bothering to help due to how stubborn my Dad was. I sat on a pile of leaves, taking in my surroundings. I was a curious child, which is where my problem lay. I remember hearing a sound I can't describe, like a whisper in the wind that not only caught my attention but pulled me towards it. I tugged on my mothers shirt, telling her I could hear something but she shrugged and told me it was only the wind. I knew it wasn't. The wind could never sound like that, so clear, so unnerving. 

I followed the sound, stumbling over tree roots and branches until I finally found the source of the noise. A willow tree stood in the centre of a small clearing. I stopped in my tracks as I realized something was off. I heard nothing. Not a sound. No rustling of leaves or birds in the trees. Nothing. I couldn't take my eyes off of the tree. There were bones placed against the trunk and hanging off of a few of the branches. The bones were not clean and far too human looking. They looked like some Kind of offering. Something felt very wrong. Being there felt wrong. I felt wrong. 

Now. My feet move towards the same tree I saw when I was a child. It remembers me. It remembers what I did for it that day. How I took the a stake my dad was using to pitch the tent and drive it through his skull as he slept, the same with my mother. Their blood quenching the thirst of the soil beneath them.

This was no ordinary tree. It was alive.
Aware.
Hungry.
I was the one it needed to fulfill it's insatiable hunger.

It remembered my offerings and my promise to bring more. 

I must fulfill my promise. I silently walk forward, with an axe resting against the back of my friends head, forcing her in the direction of the tree. The roots wrapping around her legs as it pulls her halfway into the earth.

""What's happening, why are you doing this to me?"" She cried out. ""We are killing the earth and now the earth is killing us"" I responded. ""We must reep what we sow"". And with one swift swing, her head is cut from her body, falling at the trunk of the tree, the roots pulling it deep into the earth.

My work has barely begun",shortscarystories
"My mother is a real neat freak.

&amp;#x200B;

She can't abide dirt and disorder. Even when we were toddlers, it was, 'Come on, kids, let's put your toys away if you're done playing!'

&amp;#x200B;

It's always been a thousand times more intense around the holidays: Constant dish-washing from all the baking, furniture buffed mercilessly to an extra gleam, even tree ornaments must be feather-dusted. Wrapping paper and ribbon would be snatched up to recycle as soon as presents were unwrapped--she nearly drove herself crazy trying to keep up with all the extra mess. My dad would take my sisters and me out sledding, just to get away from the tension.

&amp;#x200B;

This year is the worst she has ever been. I am amazed she can still think of such things as cleaning and tidiness, given that Dad and both my brothers came down with the same flu that seems to have taken almost everyone else in town. Inside our house smells of  decay, but outside, it is much, much stronger, and silent. Normally I'd hear carols playing, cars,  and see twinkling lights, but all is dark now.

&amp;#x200B;

And still, Mom tries desperately to clean, scrub, and keep order....

&amp;#x200B;

""Nena, I need you to help me with your father, honey--and put your boots away, will you?"" I sigh, and trudge upstairs to 'help'.

&amp;#x200B;

'Help' is a ridiculous way to put it, really. My father and sisters are beyond help. I don't know if this flu has an official name, but I call it the Cookie Flu--because my father and sisters are pretty much crumbling away, more every day. I don't know how they are still alive, but my mother insists on washing them, changing sheets-- she is obsessed with the idea of any germs lingering. I hold a towel, ready to pick up clumps of flesh that peel away, as my mother runs a wet, bleach-soaked cloth down Dad's arms. I try not to puke at the sight of sinew, tendons, and even bone showing through the torn holes in his arms and face, and even I can see that it doesn't matter anymore about germs, it's too late for that, but Mom just grimly wrings the cloth out, and keeps swiping, harder and harder, frustrated at making more mess than she can clean up--""Gotta keep 'em clean--kill all these germs,"" she mutters, then sends me for more bleach.

&amp;#x200B;

I head downstairs, trying not to cry. I wish I could just end this. I'm going to die trying to help my mother clean, for God's sake. I go out to the garage, trying to find another bottle of bleach.

&amp;#x200B;

And I do find some, but even better, I find Dad's gas can. I take that back inside, instead of the bleach.

&amp;#x200B;

I think maybe I can help my mother  get rid of all the germs, after all. I pour gasoline on the stairs, and hall floor, and light a match.",shortscarystories
"Mankind is a plague, a stain.

It has infected and sickened the Earth. Crawling around it.

In their arrogance, they have convinced themselves that they have claimed the Earth as their vessel. As their belonging.

But it is more than that. They claim that they were born of omniscience. Forged in the image of 'Gods'. They claim all Earth's are theirs. All space was created for them.

They destroy it. In the name of evolution. They ruin 'their' soil to keep themselves fed. They tear down 'their' forests to keep themselves warm. They slaughter 'their' animals to keep themselves safe.

But it is more than that. They are more dangerous than any creature, for strength and speed is the law of the forests and the jungles. But intellect and destruction is the law of the beasts.

Left alone, they will continue to conquer and colonize. Spreading like a disease from country to country, now planet to planet. Ripping nature apart to feed their hunger for resources to fuel greater greed.

But I am more than that. I can see beyond the present. I can live through the past. I have seen and witnessed the destruction brought by mankind in the next generations and I have waged humanity unwelcome to rule. Unworthy to live and so I will kill plague with plague.

"Walt was a young German boy from Munich who had lived on a quaint and small farm with his abusive father, neglective mother, and fatally ill younger brother, Gunther.

Walt had to protect Gunther from his father's drunken wrath, and usually was belted with the metal part of a belt.

The children hated their lives, usually trying to escape their father, but he always found them. 

One night, Walt got in trouble from telling his mother how much of a shitty guardian she was. That made Walt's father livid, so he switched his belt out for bat, and broke his left arm.

Walt had enough, and so the next day, he took action.

Walt had been ordered to feed the horses, and the food was in a shed filled with other feed and tools, but the specific tool Walt had his thoughts on was a scythe. A simple, but effective tool.

And so once he returned, Walt murdered his father swiftly, one swipe and he was down. Next was his mother.

He wanted a different murder method for her, so he took up a kitchen knife, and slit her throat.

With his parents dead, he checked on his brother, who layed there, motionless.

He was dead.

Walt had nothing left. 

He killed his parents, his brother passed on from an illness. He had enough.

So he impaled himself on a bayonet, and the farm went silent.

"Cold snow covered the mountains, the pass was frozen over, the river an icy bridge across the peaks of the tall mountains. Flurries dusted the Rocky cliffs as two hunters marched through the deep banks.

Rosy cheeks and frowned lips, limbs swaddled in coats. Burning whiskey in their veins as they searched for an elk feast.

Jeremiah and Jemothy Holindae lived with each other's families at the base of the cold mountain. With their parents and boths wives and children in a warm lively cabin. Fire burning in its place waiting for some beast to cook upon its  spit, as the brothers marched to find the dinner to fit.

It was the eve of Christmas, the spirit of it and the holidays filling their hearts and that of their small village. But festivities did not feed a family, so out they marched in search of a Yuletide dinner.

""Jem, hey Jem, Look yonder up them hills."" 

They moved their snowflake dusted gaze to the sparkling white tipped hills as three figures of white moved quickly across the slope.

""Yetis!"" 

They ran at the beasts, feet slapping against the snowy banks, moving up the bluff towards the forms of frosted ivory fur. They kneels up pointed their hardware and let loose a slurry of fire, aim true as the achromatic beings fell to the firm.

They walked towards the beings to investigate the slayed creatures, never before seen the now dead creatures of town mythos. 

""Jer...Those ain't no yetis.""

Horror dawned on them as they saw human faces swathed between the alabaster fur-lined hoods. Blood seeped out human blood, staining their coats and the snow with buckshot tainted blood.

"It was Midsummer’s Day when it happened. I was taking a nap by the large apple tree in my family’s homestead somewhere in the north of Mexico after watching the livestock for the day. During my brief periods of wakefulness I saw the stars twinkle and flutter like fireflies in the dark void of the night. Not a minute after another bout of sleep was there a tremendous crash outside of the fenced perimeter of the homestead. I jolted awake while the birds shriek and the livestock panicked in their sleeping quarters. Thinking it was another coyote or jacket, I jumped to my feet and silently stole my way to the source of the crash. Tail steady and feet planted, I avoided thorny bushes and cacti on my way to the source which brought me to thick clearing by a small river.

  After searching the area I saw the source of a crash; a medium tree has fell, but I could tell from the scratch marks and jagged break that it caused by beast not man nor nature. Before I could make further guesses, there were heavy footsteps coming from the east and I stole my way into a bush. A minute afterwards did the beast show itself it that clearing, and what I saw shook me to my very core. It looked like the bastard son of fear and darkness itself, with it’s red eyes watery like wine and skin so tight and drawn back it makes it’s spikes and claws look painful to behold. Nervously walking out of the bush, I barked out a quiet ‘who are you?’ And the beast responded with a curious chittering through a multi-faceted mouth, similar to the mouth parts of a fly. Suddenly gaining interest in something else, the beast fled the clearing and followed the path I took. I soon follow it, barking at it to try to get it away from the farm, but my pleads fell on deaf ears as it continues to advance forward. 

When it reached the farm, I jumped on it’s back to scare it off, but a fierce slash from it’s claws knocked me to the ground, my face red from my own blood.   Not knowing what else to do, I went to my owner’s house, scratching at the door and pleading for help. After my owner saw my wounded face, he grabbed his shotgun and we both crept to the sheep pen, where the beast loudly feasted on it’s inhabitants. After spotting the beast, my owner shot two rounds from his gun, missing both, while I bit and scratched at it’s heels. After the beast fled through a gap in the fence, my owner and I checked the damage done by the monstrous creature. The total was 10 dead sheep, drained of their blood, while the rest stood terrified from the beast’s encounter. By the end of the night, my owner had uttered those two words that still gives me the chills to this day ‘El Chupacabra’.",shortscarystories

I see the little girl running up to the stranger. They can't see me but my eyes are fixed on them. I don't know who the girl is, but I know what will happen next. I see the shining silver blade slowly peeking out of the man's dirty jacket.

In moments, the bright pink dress of the girl is stained red. I see the cries of the girl muffled by the man. Slowly the cries subside and there's silence again. I watch the man and his devious smile.


I see the man again, broken down lying on the hospital bed. All his tissues burning from inside due to the chemotherapy. He can't even cry out. The teardrops trickling down his cheeks hurt. He wishes to die because it hurts so bad. But he can't. I watch the man and his silent cries.

" 

Olive loved her mom. It’s just been the two of them for as long as she could remember, living in this house in small-town America. Her mom was always looking out for her, making sure Olive was safe from the medical condition she had had since birth. She was horribly allergic to the sun; if she went outside for too long, she would shrivel up and die. Her mother would remind her of this whenever Olive asked if she could go outside and play with the neighbor’s kids. It was always a no, so Olive would resign herself to an afternoon of watching the other kids play, peeping through the always-shut blinds covering the window.

This isn’t to say that Olive wasn’t happy. She was homeschooled, and her mom was very smart. She learned about math, science, and art, all right there in the living room of the little house where she had spent all 9 years of her life. Sometimes when her mom left the house, Olive would get lonely and wish she had someone to talk to. She never had any friends besides her mom.

Olive’s birthday was coming up next week when she finally decided what she wanted. A sibling, she told her mom. Someone to talk to when you’re not here. Her mom said she would think about it, as raising another child is a big responsibility. 

The day of Olive’s birthday, her mom told her she was going out, and to be good. Olive was always good. However, she was 9, and curious. One of the desk drawers in her mother’s room had always been locked, its contents begging to be explored. Olive hadn’t told her mom about the key she had found in her closet while playing dress up with her clothes. This was her chance. 

The key met the lock easily. She slid open the drawer, not sure what to expect. Inside, an old newspaper clipping sat atop a pile of papers. There was a picture of a man and a woman crying on the front page, which didn’t interest Olive. Underneath that was a flyer of some sort. There was a picture of a very young girl in pigtails on it, which Olive recognized as the same photo pinned to their fridge of her younger self.

All the sudden, the door slammed, startling Olive. She hastily shoved the paper back into the drawer and relocked it, not getting a chance to read the fine print along the bottom:

*Missing since 09/04/12*. 

Her mother had come home, leading a small crying boy by the hand through the back door. Olive squealed in delight. A brother! She ran and hugged her mother, and they showed him around his new home. Olive hoped he didn’t have the same sun allergy that she did, but her mom told her that those types of illness tended to run in families. Oh well, at least now she had someone to play with.

"Successfully braving the darkness on her return from the late shift, she readied herself to brave the darkness within her home. She opened the door and flinched. Nothing. She jumped inside and slammed the door behind her. She lit the living room and examined every inch, wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling. Still nothing. She slowly approached the bedroom hallway. Her neck tingled imagining what awaited her in the corridor: a clawed creature, crouched and crawling along the carpet; some sinister silhouette slithering across the ceiling, stalking her shadow, stretching snatching, serpentine fingers toward her. Her heart fluttered, soaking her body with chilled blood. It was too much—unbearable. If the monstrous manifestations of her mind didn’t murder her, then surely her sprinting heart would collapse from fatigue.

She slapped at the hall’s light switch and found it empty. With cautious feet, she moved to each room, sliding reluctant hands along dark walls in search of light switches. Nothing here. Nothing there. Her furnishings and she cast the only shadows about the house, and none had volume. All was still, which only catalyzed her fretting mind. So, she turned on the TV and gave herself a moment of deep breathing on the couch. There was nothing about but safety and security … and solitude.

After a second look-see, she fell back into routine; brushed teeth, washed face, cleared acne, but, more importantly, cleared her mind. She finally laid herself down to bed. But, still, something felt different. She scanned the room from her pillow. The bedside lamp spilled splotches of shadows onto the walls, though none appeared malicious. The closet door was partially ajar and she considered for a moment removing herself from the safety and comfort of her sheets to shut it, thereby attenuating the vivid thoughts of the endless, malevolent possibilities within the closet that would assuredly ensue should she leave that gateway open. But she was sure—so sure—that if she were to place a foot down onto the floor, something would take her by the ankle. Something … 

No, she told herself. Calm down.

She took a slow, deep breath, paused, and exhaled. It was time to sleep, not time to run wild in imagination. She wanted to roll over, to face away from the light and finally rest her eyes, but began to fear the notion that something was lying beside her; that, should she turn, she’d find something gazing upon her mere inches from her face. A face to mirror her own, perhaps; one with twisted teeth in an impossibly wide smile.

No, damn it.

Again, she calmed herself. Again, she breathed deeply. She would need darkness and a serene mind to drift asleep. And so, with much hesitation, she reached out and shut off the lamp. And there it stood; in the corner by the nightstand. It stood. It watched. She watched likewise, too crippled by fear to do much else. There she remained watching. There it remained standing. There it remained still; until it didn't.",shortscarystories

I haven't been a teacher for too long so I guess it wouldn't hurt to change up my methods. It sucks because my first three years went by so smoothly. Not to sound lazy, but I was hoping I could just coast by on the tactics I used from the very start.

""Yes, what is it, Joyce?""

""I just don't think a lot of us feel comfortable reading this after what happened to Holden last week. I mean... Candace is so torn up over losing him she hasn't been to school since she got the news.""

""And you're implying that the death of her boyfriend mixed with irrational teenage emotions hits to close to the reading?"" I questioned.

""Yes, sir...""

Finally! They were starting to connect the story to real-life events and relate to it better. Only time would tell if Joyce would end up with the same fate as Juliet. I'd let that play out on its own. Sadly, I had to get my hands dirty on account of Holden but the pride I felt in my students trumped any regret I had over that.",shortscarystories

The baby farm is another amazing feature our insurance also covers. Parents like to raise and teach their kids, but nobody wants to deal with a stinky infant that can't even speak words. To think that some mothers are still forced to change diapers and lose sleep annoys me so much. It's very simple manual labor, way below the dignity of a human being. Especially an educated couple like us. 

The idea came from a very unlikely source. 

After the civil unrest of the early 20s, there were plenty of prisoners, many of them in solitary, and not enough prison officers, often they were alone for days. Dr. Richard Strauss knew about the mental risks of solitary confinement, and to alleviate them (and reduce the officers' labor) he developed the Self-Contained Human Environment (SCHE). The SCHE was essentially a really fancy solitary cell. Two of the walls and a ceiling are touchscreens with bulletproof glass, one side is the entry/exit door, absolutely unbreachable, and on the other are dispensers for food and water and a toilet for waste. The back side looks like a huge USB port - it takes in water, power, and 8 core ingredients that it combines to make a surprising variety of foods, and sends out waste. 

So you put the inmate in, seal the door, and mount the cube on a huge rack where it plugs in. Then you can forget about them entirely. The inside is indestructible, and the SCHE entertainment system will make sure they forget about you as well. It has games, videos, feeds, all tailored to the inmate's interests. If it predicts that they will try to break out or self-harm, the system will recommend content that will pacify them. 

The system revolutionized the prison industry, but soon after it was used in many other places. SCHE capsule hotels, and now, SCHE baby farms. 

Four years later, we came back for our girl. ""Unfortunately, there's been a hack. Our database got wiped, we did everything we could, truly, but we have no idea whose kid is whose anymore. We got a few thousand units here, is there any way you can tell?""",shortscarystories
"Jim and Tom were the best of friends, in the swamps they would spend their days laughing and playing about. As they grew into men, they each preferred to spend time fishing. Both being competitive types, they would make bets on who could catch the bigger fish or who could catch one the fastest, things like that. 

One day the two got into a fight, Tom angrily set his boat out on the water, watching Jim whittle on the shore. Tom felt his hate swell in his belly, so he grabbed his rifle and shot Jim right in his overalls. Tom buried Jim underneath a willow tree and spat on the soil as he walked off, ready to see what kind of fish he could catch the next day. That morning Tom grabbed his rod and headed out on his boat. Two hours went by without any kind of dance in the water when Tom got an idea. He dug up his buddy and was happy to see plenty of worms and grub wriggling around on Jim, Tom grabbed a handful and ventured out to the swamp again.

Out went his line, and immediately he was pulled to his feet as something took the bait. Tom started whooping and hollering happy as can be until he noticed a long snout emerge from the water sporting rows and rows of teeth. 

The alligator pulled Tom into the water, where he remains to this day.",shortscarystories
"She  woke up groggily in the night, not sure of what stirred her up from  sleep. It felt like she had heard a small cry, but now only the usual  stream of late cars vaguely broke the silence of her 21st floor  apartment.

She was thirsty, so she  got up and went to the kitchen. In passing, she threw a glance inside  the kids’ room. They were fast asleep, for all the fight they had put up  going to bed. “*When will daddy come  back?” “Frankly, Tom, I don’t know if he ever will. Seems like his idea  of ‘till death do us part’ is pretty flimsy*”.

She smiled at the idea of telling them that and went for a glass of water.

When  she finally realized that the silhouette mimicking her every move  across the window was not the reflection, she rose her eyes from the  sink and froze from the shock.

The  man on her balcony was naked, awfully thin. A few tuft of hairs adorned  his malformed head, and he covered his mouth in surprise with his  hands, parodying her expression of terror with glee in his eyes.

Her glass had shattered on the floor. *The kids’ window is open*.  She took one hesitant step, careful not to walk on glass, towards the  door. He did the same. She stopped moving. He did the same. She took two  more steps, and he followed her.

If she went to the bedroom, he would get to the window before her to the door.

As  the idea of a cry for help went through her mind, he broke his  imitating act. Just for a brief moment, he shot a glance to his left -  her right; towards Tom and Allan’s room. Then he lifted a bony, clawed  finger to his mouth and made a shushing expression.

She nodded her head hurriedly and he smiled. He had a mouth too big, that stretched too far, and way too many teeth.

That  night was the longest of her life. Watching that… thing… stand in the  open, in the cold of Paris winter, staring at her. Smiling from time to  time. Not knowing, trying not to guess, if he had climbed inside before  she came here, if the blue blankets had been made darker than usual by  slow exsanguination in her brief vision.

When the sun rose, he vanished. Suddenly and without a trace.

She  ran to the children’s room, took the both of them - blissfully alive -  and ran out. She begged and screamed in the street until someone called  the cops.

They never found anything.

She never came back here.",shortscarystories

Whispering; chittering; chattering. Echoes down in the dark. They beg, you see, persistently. It muddles and maddens the mind.  Scaly voices scraping up from the shadows below. Oh repeatedly, night after night, I was tortured, tested-  bent to breaking point.

But no more, my dear.

They suggest things, you see, such salacious, succulent things. Enticing out my deprived desires into the light. How they discovered them I shall never know, but, in any case, they succeeded as I succumbed. So, my dear, you were sent for.

"Some people think seeing the future is like seeing a set of cards. Each card represents a possible future, amd together they make up the hand of the universe. Others think you can only see what might happen, but nothing is certain. 

I wish that were true.

I can see the future. I see a lot of things, both good and bad. But here's the thing. I only see certainties. What I see always happens. Always. Even if I try to change it, I know I will fail because I already saw myself try and fail before I even started. I've tried so many things. I'll try a lot more by the time I'm done, too. 

I can't do anything to stop it. I never will. Nothing I've done or will do  works because it is never destined to work. Suicide isn't an option for that very reason. Apparently I'm destined to live a very long time. It would be nice to know that I will be able to see my great-grandchildren, if I didn't know exactly how and when all of them will die. 

And now yet another year will pass, and the next will take its place. How I wish I still had the optimism all of you have. The hope that what comes next might be better than what came before. But after what I've seen...

       Everything around me turned black, and I froze. Out of the darkness there, what I can only describe as demons with long fingernails, appeared. Then it started.
        They took their long nails and ripped my stomach open, and start eating it. I tried opened my mouth to scream, but nothing came out.
        They start cutting and cutting at my organs, and stuffing their faces, my body filled with blood, I felt every, single, cut. My organs start to regrow, and it starts again. They did this for the next 8 hours.

         I grabbed my chair and threw it at my window and jumped out. I didn’t die, but my neck, spine, and arms were all terribly broken. It’s a miracle that I was able to eventually recover physically, but my mind was never the same again.
          I couldn’t sleep with out the lights on for years, and when I stopped, I never stared again, not even in the light, that’s how bad I was. I’m telling you this, when your body doesn’t want to stare, don’t stare.",shortscarystories
"The column puzzles that repeated themselves until the confines of the city now represented a maze of perdition and decay. Nothing lived, everything resembled a gray desert adorned with blind and deaf walls, product of the horror they witnessed. Not even nature dared to retake this barren and devastated place. The empty streets were interrupted by bones and traces of decomposing flesh, witnesses of the divine slaughter that took place. Thick black blood was permanently imprinted on the balconies and bars of the spacious temples used uselessly as shelters.

They appeared without warning. Death and extreme suffering exercised by the sword through the centuries was the eternal condemnation of this people. Redemption ceased to exist, and at that moment the tall figures appeared on the horizon, rising from the seas. The Supreme Punishment was here.

Our Lord chose two and gave us immunity. The beasts did not pursue us, but our eyes still suffered from witnessing the carnage taking place. No sword or spear could stand against the giant jaws of the beasts. We watched from a mountain as aberrations ate the twisted bodies of their victims as they smiled in a perverse manner.

By the third day the entire population was exterminated, and only the two of us remained. He commanded us to leave the forgotten city and go to the promised land, and so we did. We walked through the fields impregnated by the bloody river. Then we saw the fields, sign of the beautiful and fertile gardens. It was a paradise full of life and hope. We were free, finally.

In short, something happened that messed up the sleep patterns of most people. It would show in two ways:  A victim would fall asleep and enter into a coma or a victim would lose the ability to sleep at all. The former couldn’t be prevented, the latter couldn’t be solved and both were undetectable, until the symptoms showed up.

Sedatives no longer induced a state of sleep and stimulants were running dry. People resorted to rudimentary methods to treat their problems: electric shocks, loud sounds, the self-infliction of pain and even suicide. I’ve just been watching old movies while the power is still on. It’s cut out a few times here and there, but even then I have plenty of books on standby.

"When his pregnant wife’s labour started one month early, he kept his calm. He had a mission. He drove her to the hospital among cries of pain and insults to the feminine condition, amidst the rain and the wind.

When the doctors told him that the baby was in the wrong way and couldn’t come out, that they would have to operate, he kept his calm. He trusted them to help her to the best of their abilities.

When they told him that something was deeply wrong and she was dying, he kept his calm. It felt surreal. He called his in-laws, who were already on their way from three states away, and announced them the news in an awfully cool voice to his own ears.

*“She won’t die”*, his mother-in-law told him. *“I promise you this. But you have to act quick. Tell the doctors to enact emergency code 77-77. They will understand. No one, including you, the baby or doctors, must be in the same room as her when she bleeds out. You get me? No one!”*

As she screamed, he kept his calm. As he repeated her words to the security team, he kept his calm. It seemed like someone knew what was going on. A phone call was made, the room was evacuated, and security teams showed up.

When they fled from the operation room with his son in their arms, when they locked it behind them and posted armed men to prevent entry, he managed to keep his calm. There was no way he could fight them.

But when they took him to a small chamber next to his wife’s, when they refused to let him see his baby, when they locked him up and started questioning him, he almost lost it.

*“Did she ever bite you? Scratch you? Was the sex rough? Was she violent, mistreating you or anyone around you? Prone to anger?”*

And hours later, even the calming texts from his mother-in-law did not calm him. As he curled in a ball and cried, the sounds coming from his wife’s room - growls, scratches, cries - even as they proved she was alive, did not calm him. The knowledge that he was a father did not calm him, nor the thought that he would finally learn what was weird with her and her family.

No, what calmed him was a low hum coming from the window. He rose and watched as much as the closed blinds allowed him too.

It came from the sky. It calmed him.

And there he stayed, awaiting nothing, aware of nothing, staring at the full moon that rose above the clouds. It was so god damn beautiful.",shortscarystories
"Two wrongs don't make a right, they always told me.

When I was in kindergarten, there was a kid who would keep taking my toy away from me before I could play with it. I was constantly contemplating grabbing the toy from him so I could have it for myself. I wanted it for myself.

But that's wrong. And two wrongs don't make a right.

When I was in elementary school, I was being picked on by an older kid. He would call me names, push me, shove me, hit me, do everything he could to make me feel absolutely pitiful. I always wanted to be able to fight back, to hurt him the same way he's always hurt me.

But that's wrong. And two wrongs don't make a right.

When I was in middle school, I had a crush on a girl. Soon enough, I had finally worked together enough courage to ask her out. But when I tried to tell her how I felt, she called me gross and shoved me in front of all of her friends. I wanted to push her back for rejecting me like that. I wanted to shove her for breaking my dreams with her own selfishness.

But that's wrong. And two wrongs don't make a right.

I'm in high school now. I had a friend who I always vented all of my personal problems to. I *had* a friend who would listen to everything I've been through. And he betrayed me. We got in a fight, and he got his revenge by posting an embarrassing story about me on social media. It spread through the school like wildfire. And now I'm a laughing stock.

But now, I come to school, finally able to fight back.

Now, I come to school, finally able to get the revenge I've always been itching to get.

"I as I peer out of an observatory module, I see the world in its most beautiful form; shadowy, with starry lights branding continents into the sphere. As an astronaut, this is the time I cherish, when status dispatches quell, and my short window of peace emerges.

As I look down at the massive capacity of our planet I see the lights begin to flicker, and tracers appear over the seas; this display is clearly out of the norm, and quite disconcerting. As I float down a narrow passageway, I hear my transmitter beep repeatedly in a tone I don’t recognize. I take a moment to look at some of the pictures that we have decorated the sterile walls with. The Russian astronaut I currently share this expanse with has a beautiful family, including four smiling children.

I finally check my transmitter that won’t stop beeping in an eerie tone that, once again, sounds alien in comparison to the usual symphony of chimes and rings. I look down at my screen.

3. No related appliances will be available (due to the nature of your previous employment), *and manual asphyxiation is preferred because of the non-viability of brute force in zero-G*

3. **DO NOT: ENTER LABORATORIES, AS CHEMICALS MAY RELEASE IN THE ABSENCE OF GROUND CONTROL**

I float by an open door to a lab, and a hissing noise causes all my inner alarms to sound. I frantically push past the door into another room that ends suddenly, smashing my head. As my nose runs and my chest tightens, I remember the organophosphoric research taking place in that lab.

A door crashes from where I entered, and a red warning light briefly illuminates a nightmarish figure through glass. A humanoid wearing a respirator and a painful look fades back into darkness.

Anyway it must be really good with the surround sound. It was only a few bucks used but some of the noises and screeches are really good. I'm sure I couldn't hear some before. Just shows how important good audio is. I tend to close my eyes while listening and you can really hear the demonic screeching and growls.

"There’s always a twist.

Surely you have all come to know that.

There will always be something, a turn of events that subverts your expectations in a way.

In certain scenarios of unease, it could be a supposedly supernatural threat turning out to be something horribly close to reality, or a person finding themselves hunted, only for the hunter to become the target’s prey. It can be anything, so as long as it invokes shock and fear from within.

Without a twist, things would not be the way they are. It really is that essential, is it not?

In this case, as you are studying a chronicle of terror, that means there is bound to be a complexity of sorts, one that changes everything.

The question is, what is it? What dreadful thing will happen next?

Will it be you realizing the existence of things unspeakable? Or, is it your friends and family not being what they seem? What about, the discovery of a dark presence, festering within your very being? Many people having it out for you? An impending doomsday? Nothing being real at all?

Or, worse yet...

...could I be something harmful myself, whether it be a man most wicked, or a BEAST most impure, filled to the brim with an **OVERWHELMING DESIRE, TO SPILL YOUR OWN ICHOR UNTIL THERE IS NONE LEFT?!**

Mostly, though, she wasn't there. She was oddly disconnected from herself, watching from a distance without much interest. On some level, perhaps she was aware that this was a memory she'd have to delete. She'd need to not remember this, need to be distraught and shocked and horrified. Then there'd be no more questions. Just silence. Years of peaceful silence.

Was she even awake? She hadn't been a few minutes ago; she wouldn't be a few minutes from now. Maybe this was all just a dream. The kind of dream you don't remember on waking up.

She'd wake up and be shocked by reality, because this was just a dream she'd forget. That felt right. That felt easy to believe.

"I was kidnapped many years ago by a now-dead and infamous serial killer. I am the only survivor of his as he notoriously never let any of his victims survive. I live because of an opportunity that was presented to me. He had dumped my badly tortured body, after he had water-boarded and mutilated me, near a cave. He thought I was dead. I really wished I was.

After what felt like an entire lifetime, I woke up and crawled into the cave for shelter as it had started raining. I leaned against a rock and tried to catch my breath. Carved into the rock before me was a riddle, a riddle which I would come to hate. It was etched into the stone, as smooth as a newly polished pebble, and black in color.

‘I am awake in the night, but I see in the day. I eat in the dark, but I feast in the light. I listen to screams in the fire, but I create music in blood. I feel joyous making new friends, but terrible when these people banish me, what am I?’

I didn’t have a chance to think when the answer popped into my head, Demon. 

“Did you solve my riddle?” A deep voice boomed in the damp cave, the same voice that was in my head, and reverberated off of the grey and green walls. 

“Yes,” I scratched out, my throat burned with every breath, “Demon.”

The dark voice continued, “Thank you for solving my riddle! Since you solved it, I will grant you one wish, and one wish alone. Think hard now as I don’t have all day to cater to a dying woman.”

I coughed, blood pooling in my mouth from a hole in my cheek. “I want to survive,” I mumbled.

“Granted.”

Years have passed since that fateful day in my life. When I was found, I was rushed to the hospital where I stayed for over two months. I was all over the news and became a celebrity. I wrote a book, got married, had four children, and spent over a decade in therapy. It all ends now. 

I have been called upon tonight to give my final goodbyes. I knew this day was going to come as I had been hearing the voice in my head for so long. It told me that I owed it, that one day soon it would come for me, and I knew what I had to do. If I didn’t complete what I owed it, then it would come for my family too.

I owed it my life since it gave me my life.

He chuckles, flashing his pearly whites. I deleted the extra orders and customized the one he wanted. ""Thank you very much."" He held his receipt and looked around, he clocked the charm bracelet on my arm. ""Are you a fan of Jem too? My daughter loves Synergy."" He says, presumably talking about the one who was standing next to him. She was about 9, large brown eyes and long cascading hair. Wearing purple overalls and a long sleeved white turtleneck,  although it was summer. Her face was dirty with caked on mud and dust that fell when she turned her head. ""Yeah Jem is truly outrageous."" I smiled at the girl and waved. She didn't wave back but stared up at him silently. Typical kid. Maybe she was tired, the dark circles under her eyes were a good sign.
""I like a lot or older cartoons, but the ones made now are good too."" I shrugged and we began to talk. 

   He was funny and recommended me some cartoons I had never heard of. Getting our food at roughly the same time, we all walked out together. The young girl staying at her father's side, still not talking. ""Where ya headed?"" He asked once in the parking lot. ""Just to the mall."" I nodded to the mall that was maybe a five minute walk. ""Oh I'm heading there, want a ride?"" He unlocked his Prius, standing next to the drivers door. ""Uh.."" I thought about it. Five minute walk vs a thirty second drive. The girl finally stopped staring at her father and looked me straight in the eyes, she shook her head the slightest bit. *No.* She mouthed silently, dirt spilling from her mouth over her cracked lips.
""I'm good. I need the exercise."" I laughed, nervously. 
He cocked his head, ""you sure? It's no trouble for me, really."" He took a step forward, placing his McDonald's bag on the roof of the car. 
""Thank you but I'm ok. Have a good one!"" I turned down the road and ran. I ran as fast as my legs could take me. ",shortscarystories
"I usually jog alone but a guy I use to know from school messaged me on Facebook wanting to start jogging with me. He was an old friend of mine and he never really was into sports. I remember in school that he never took part in sports especially those that required lots of running. He never told us if he had any disability which made him not able to do much sports. Any how I agreed that he could jog with me and I was excited with catching up with him. When the day of the jogging came, he warned me that it was important that we both jogged at the same pace and that neither of us could jog too fast or too slow.

His tone seemed serious like it was a matter of life and death. As we started jogging he was completely silent and there was this awkwardness in the air that I couldn't get rid of. I started to become curious and decided to jog a little faster than him and as soon as I did that my friend started shouting ""you have any idea what you have done. I have a condition that if anyone is jogging or running in front of me I become a monster that starts chasing them and they become the prey that runs away!""

My friend turned into a monster and he was chasing me and in his monster form he was trying to grab hold of me. I then ducked as he tried to grab me in his monster form and he was now in front of me and I was behind him while still jogging. Then as my friend turned normal he still shouted at me ""no no no now that your behind me and im jogging faster than you it will make you the monster and me the victim""

My body started transforming and it was so painful and even though I knew I was a monster my human side was imprisoned inside the mind of a monster. I could see myself in monster form chasing down my friend who wasn't use to sprinting and I tried to stop myself but couldn't. I killed him as I grabbed him and when he died I transformed back into a human. 

My friend before fully dying smiled at me and told me that it was my curse now. 

No one else was around and I walked back home. I hate this curse. Even when someone walks past me a bit faster than me I could feel the monster inside me nearly coming out. I am trapped.",shortscarystories
"
My name is Sheldon Blanche, I live in EdKin, Ohio. I'm a twenty year old college...dropout, but I'm not a dumbass or anything. Well I guess I am, I had to drop out because I was too lazy to go down to the gas station for a pack of condom. I have to support my now pregnant girlfriend, Shawna.

I usually walk every night from my house to the train station at late hours. Recently I've been cutting through a park a block or two away from our apartment building. No one is out there at that time of night so its basically just twenty minutes of me letting my mind rest before I had to use it at work. This night, I turn the corner onto the ave. I always did and walk into the park. I got a few feet in when I see a black shadow in the shape of a man, I couldn't be sure because the person is too far away. I hadn't faced this problem before, but I did from my line of work know how to look intimidating.

I pick my head up and place a mean mug on my face. However, I soon dropped that look and replace it with one of confusion. The further I walk down the beaten path the closer I get to them, I could hear...singing.

Yes singing, and it wasn't your average get down and boogie song. This song unnerved the hell out of me, it isn't a song you could recognize because the person was speaking complete gibberish set to a melody. The person threw their arms in the air, and I mean, literally, they stretch them more than humanly possible. Coming closer I could see it was a guy and he's a heavy set man, with bare BLOODY feet, his disheveled fog like Sandy brown hair is hidden underneath a torn filthy dodgers cap, he wears a dark brown plaid shirt, and tattered jeans.

I didn't know if I should walk past him or not, he stopped doing everything when I walked up so he had to have sensed my presence. As I weigh my options, a light hit me in the face. The shine is coming from the street light he was under, it beamed off the...blade he was holding...an eight inch bowie knife....he must've pulled it out when I was deep in thought.

I froze, and before you comment saying I should've just backed tracked, shut the hell up. You don't get to give me advice if you haven't experienced this, this level of fear. I didn't know what this guy plan to do, he just stares at the night's sky holding the knife, tightening his grip around the handle.

Suddenly he turns his head, his dark brown eyes locked with my pale blue ones. A devilish grin takes over his face as he turns his body, now he's completely facing my direction. His eyes have pure joy in them, I saw the man had a deeply carved glasgow smile from ear to ear, he takes a step towards me muttering.

""Glasgow KISSS, make your world one of BLISSS.""",shortscarystories
"“The washroom is down the hall, here’s a bottle of water. You know where the fridge is. If you need anything else, just give me a shout, just like the old times, brother”

This is the last thing my younger brother told me before switching off the lights. I had just landed from an almost 24 hour flight from Los Angeles to Mumbai and I had decided to stay with my brother and his wife, instead of checking into another hotel. It was 1 a.m. when my brother had left the room, leaving me in the dark and I was wide awake thanks to the jet-lag.

So there I was, lying on the bed in the dark, until my eyes slowly got used to the darkness and I could slowly start making out the details of the room. I could see the shadow of the study table and the chair; the soft red glow of the LED light in the Air Conditioner; the blades of the ceiling fan, weirdly a bit on the right side of the room and a pair of yellow eyes belonging to a silhouette on the ceiling directly above me.

It took my brains a couple of microseconds to register what was wrong with the last bit of information, and as if on cue, the figure descended on me at the same time. This was my last memory as a living person.

The funniest thing is, I had written this story on the flight, and 2 hours ago, I was on a ceiling, looking down at my living self right before I jumped on him and killed him",shortscarystories
"How do you entertain yourself on a boring date? I don't know personally, but the sad hookup culture of tinder had led me here. The woman who sat in front of me rambled on about her dog. Not to be disrespectful but I didn't much like her. Dogs are cool but how can someone talk about one for 30 minutes? Maybe I was just being grouchy.

I kept up your standard banter, and talked a bit about my interests. I couldn't help but think this would be our only date, this woman seemed like her entire personality was made of plastic, so basic. My mind was also in other places. Recently I had gotten a well, follower. The unwanted kind. I had first noticed someone following me. The same three cars following me, love letters in the mail. It's hard to go get a casual hookup when you don't know if someone may be watching from a tree.

The night progressed and we left the restaurant. We took things back to her house. Another tally for my unhealthy sex habits I guessed. We got inside her house and I noticed she was locking all her doors and drawing her curtains. Then she asked; "" Well Han, how are your orchids?"" No one who hadn't been to my house would know about my orchids. Then it dawned on me. She kept going; "" I have a rather extensive collection of dates stored in my attic, you'll be joining them soon."" I had to stifle my laughter. She noticed my silence and asked; ""What, cat got your tongue?"" I replied ""Well if you were a half good stalker, or serial killer, you would've known that I'm a fucking hit man, god lady even your crimes are uninteresting. SO basic."" She looked a bit shocked, and started to reach for a drawer on her table. She wasn't slick as she tried to pull out a gun. I shot first. I left a sufficient amount of evidence for what she did in her free time out, and called the police on her phone, then I decided to call it a night and walk home.",shortscarystories
"The evil man acts like he loves my mom. But the way her bones quake when he’s awake makes me believe different. 

He tells me that what happens in his house stays in his house as he cracks my ribs with his over sized knuckles. 

I know I can’t tell my dad about moms evil friend because they will take my dad away. Sometimes I think mom is the evil one. Evil spreads. 

The evil man pulled out a gun and put it to my moms head. I dialed the only number on the phone that I thought could help. 

The evil man went away, but he will be back. Evil always comes back and evil always spreads.

"My family was rich, way richer than we ever needed to be. We had a huge mansion, way bigger than three people needed, not counting all of the household help we had. My mama and papa had fancy cars and took luxurious vacations. My mama bought a new wardrobe every month and my papa bought the newest gun model the moment it came out.

My papa ran hundreds of successful businesses all around the world and my mama was an incredibly popular model that featured in every magazine you could think of.

The bad thing was though was that I saw them rarely. Papa was a workaholic and mama was always running off with someone, mostly men. I was only born because my grandparents complained about not having an heir. But even though my papa worked a lot, I still saw him quite often and was his little girl. Every time  I saw him I would literally jump for joy. My mama on the other hand...well let's just say I maybe saw her four times in my entire life, and that's counting my birth.

One night, just a week after my eighth birthday, I heard laughing and shushing from the hall outside my door. I quietly got up and opened the door a crack. Standing just a few feet way with their backs to me, was my mama and some guy I'd never seen before. They entered my papa's office and shut the door.

I was confused, because surely even mama knew that papa didn't let anyone in his office. I stepped outside into the hallway and slowly crept pass the door and turned the corner where my papa's room was. He was sleeping soundly but a few good shakes woke him up. He seemed confused at first but then slowly sat up.

""Rose honey, what's wrong?"" he asked.
""Papa, mama and one of mama's friends went into your office,"" I told him.

He visibly turned red and quickly got out of bed, I'd never seen him so angry before. He rushed to his office and I tried to keep up. When I got there, what I saw made my blood run cold.

Papa had grabbed his gun and was pointing it at them. Everyone was screaming, my mama and the friend begging for him to stop and my papa yelling at them to shut up.

It took one second. One second for the bullet to pierce my mama's skull and send her head flying back. It took ten minutes for the police to arrive. It  took six months for my papa to be found guilty. And it took another ten years for me to write this all down, finally telling people what happened that night.",shortscarystories
"My mother held her breath. The nurses were already getting worried. The doctor was preparing for the worst. Children are supposed to cry when they are born, that's how you know they are alive.

I didn't cry.

Finally they heard the child’s scream. My mother could breathe again. She didn’t realize that this was only the start of an expressionless life. Of course there were moments of happiness, moments of joy and hope. Unfortunately they were never enough to make up for it.

A part of me wished it could have felt something. Felt bad. There were the ones that deserved it. That tried. But the majority didn't.

That's why I didn't cry.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't cry when they declared war on each other.

I didn't cry when they let innocent ones drown so they wouldn't have to share their countries.

I didn't cry when they used up all the resources on earth because their ignorance was bigger than their fear.

I didn't cry when the world started burning and there was not a thing left for them to destroy.

I didn't cry when the last shimmer of light vanished.

My purpose here was to observe, not to show emotion. 

They thought the apocalypse was something to be afraid of but didn't realize that they should have been afraid of themselves. Of the demons inside them.

"It's a typical and a normal night for my family. I always drink coffee before I go to sleep but my father this time said no for this habit. He said it's something not good for my health. 

What can I do? What can I do, I am just 9. My mother on the other hand just finished cleaning up my older brother, he's 10, for sleep. It's 8 o'clock at the night. 

She assists him on his bedroom and kissed his forehead. She then approached me asking why I am still up. She then carry me on my bedroom and kissed my forehead.

""Go to sleep now, my dear.""

I closed my eyes but I am not sleeping. I want to wait until tomorrow. I want to be awake until twelve. Until my birthday.

But I can't help being sleepy that time. The hours goes by and it's morning. 

Unlike my older brother that celebrates his birthday last four months—

I just realize that I am born not even 9 months after my mother gave birth to my brother. Maybe that's why I always felt that I am left behind. Maybe that's why.

The day has passed without a single word I hear about my birthday. 

Until I woke up.

"It might be said:

&amp;#x200B;

What's the best thing you've ever eaten? When I was six, my father killed my best friend Dulce and fed him to us. He had few alternatives. The entire country was gripped by severe famine. So, he could let his beloved family starve or encourage Dulce to honor us. I imagine Dulce was loyal to the end. Afterwards, In my nightmares I would search in vain for Dulce only to discover him waiting at my door. I'd beg for his forgiveness, but he would only stare.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been years since then. I'm in America now. I have a good paying job, I can send money back home, and I can even think about the future, so I should be happy, but I'm not. I hate my job and I'm starting to hate myself for doing it. Everyday I'm bombarded by an endless stream of social decay that makes it hard for me to participate normally in society. Even worse, I don't have anyone to talk to when I feel like this. I don't come from a place that encourages therapy. My father raised seven kids on less than nothing and everyone is depending on me now.

&amp;#x200B;

Ashamedly, I'm at my breaking point, and I don't want to shatter… I won't. So I'm here in this lobby, waiting for an interview with someone that wants to hear my story. She says she can help me and that my rights are being violated. I was skeptical at first, even more when I walked in, but as the receptionist leads me to the interview room my suspicions start to fade, mostly because the hallway adjoining the interview room is lined with familiar faces. Many of my coworkers force smiles as we pass by, but behind the veneer of those placid offerings is suffering, and that commonality helps me reaffirm my resolve.

&amp;#x200B;

As I stand outside the interview room, I listen to my coworker Maricela sob the hardships that orientation doesn't prepare you for. Her particular story is harrowing. In it, she details moderating a video of these children, had to be no more than 6 or 7 years old, playing what they think is hide and seek. They're naive and naked, crouching, crawling, wiggling, and jockeying for the best hiding spots, while their innocence is distilled into 4k horror. After Maricela is done, she and the host embrace for awhile, they separate, but I don't think either wanted to let go. Then, the interviewer recomposes herself looks at me and ask, ""are you ready?”

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, I'm late for work. In the distance I see my boss beside my desk. Our eyes lock but I don't cower from his gaze. Instead, I march towards him until we're inches from each other. ""What do you have to say for yourself,"" he barks. As I respond, I realize why he's standing here. The confession I gave yesterday is playing on my monitor without censure: I'm exposed.",shortscarystories
"Have you ever wondered what exactly you'd think, say and do if you ever met you? I'm talking about a living, breathing replica of you. A doppelganger. A perfect ""me-too"". I'm sure at some point you've met someone whom others have easily mistaken for you...as I did today. 

I was heading off for work when it clicked to me as I stepped off the porch that I'd forgotten my phone. I sprinted back to my room and as I threw the door open...that's when I saw him, turning to meet me as he swung my sports bag over his shoulder. That's when he saw me. We locked each other in gaze for a solid minute or two, my mind and body abuzz with some blend of anxiety and childlike curiosity. For some reason he doesn't scare me and I feel like I know that he belongs, and that he shouldn't, all the same.

His eyebrows arch in suspicion, eyes widened. Is this how I really look when I'm startled? Is this what my face looks like beyond me? ""I'm...uhh...I'm pretty sure you've got the wrong house, buddy"" I awkwardly manage. ""Yeah,"" he replies. ""You too, probably."" His voice stirred up an inexplicable rage within me. A part of me knew that this was my voice. Another part of me was pretty damn annoyed that I sound like I'm talking with a dick in my mouth. 

""Umm...anyway, sorry about...whatever the fuck this is, I guess?"" Those are the last of his words as I watch him walk right past me, out of the room, with a weirdly familiar shrug of my shoulders. I know that he's wearing my cologne. I did not know that it could smell so different to someone else when it's on my body. I've never smelt myself like this before. Nor have I ever seen or heard of me from these angles beyond myself. I shake my head as I hear him exit through the front door. I can tell that his footsteps end abruptly as he meets the porch, and I've got this really weird sense that I'm forgetting something. I turn to face my closet.

"They hid from the beast in what had been a shop of some kind earlier that morning, but was now no more than a scorched box. They hoped that the smoke and half-scorched drapes attached to the structure would conceal them. As it lumbered through the streets, the beast could be heard snarling, mostly at charred corpses; daring them to arise and face him again.  

Burning buildings lined the streets, most of their occupants still inside; fused by heat to the structures they had failed to protect. Some lay in piles of ash throughout the street, over which the beast trampled almost joyfully. The city had been put to the sword earlier in the day, and the beast had been sent in after to wipe out those that remained. From three glands it spewed a flammable liquid, sparked to ignition by the grinding of its jagged teeth.  

The hidden people, the last remaining of their once peaceful and harmless city, watched the beast lumber past. It had not detected them. The creature, which would’ve towered over every building at their greatest heights, walked through the destroyed remains; the only standing structure closest to its height still thirty feet short of matching it. 

Satisfied with the city’s destruction and believed annihilation of its people, the beast walked away towards its handlers. The hidden people left the safety of their burnt hut and—still sticking to the shadows not illuminated by the raging fires—made their way towards the city’s center, where they hoped to find a working transport, with which to exit the city once the raiders had moved on.  

After searching for an hour, they finally found a working vehicle, and preparations were made to exit the city and rebuild elsewhere. As fuel and provisions were loaded into the transport, scouts were sent out to report on the status of the siege party. The scouts eventually returned, and reported that the raiders had withdrawn from their positions around the city walls, and were heading towards the forest northeast of the city. The beast was nowhere to be scene. Due to its immense size and slow mobility, it was often brought directly to the site of raiding by an aerial vehicle. This method of transport was presumed for its egress as well. 

With supplies fully loaded and all else prepared, the people boarded the transport. Sluggishly, the vehicle’s engine propelled the group to the southernmost gate. The people cheered, elated that they—and by extension their culture and ways—would survive. The vehicle passed the gate’s threshold and entered the hopeful night.  

The roar of the creature drowned out the sputtering engine, and its footsteps shook the ground, causing the driver to lose control. The vehicle flipped, and upon coming to a rest, trapped its occupants within its warped and collapsed frame. The beast let out a triumphant roar, and prepared a mouthful of its infernal flame.",shortscarystories
"""I feel like we would see some rendering issues if we lived in the matrix."" My roommate droned as he stared at the television we had mounted in the middle of our dorm. He curled his hand around his small glass pipe and took another hit. ""Like, you ever been wandering around in GTA and some low LOD hooker wanders by? Imagine how much that would fuck you up seeing that in real life."" He watched with glassy eyes as I failed once again to jump a virtual stolen car over a fence.

""The fuck is LOD?"" I asked out of polite Borden. I abandoned my car and went to look for a new one.

""Level of detail"" he exhaled with a fresh cloud. ""Like if you go into the strip club mini game and you're up close with an NPC, everything will be so detailed that you'll be able to see pores around the nipple, but if that same character is 100 yards away, she'll be reduced down to simple shapes and get some Laura Croft titties.""

There was a moment of silence where he seemed to be lost in thoughts of angular breasts. Slightly uncomfortable and slightly intrigued, I broke his concentration. ""Why do they do that?""

He slowly cranked his head around to face me instead of the screen. ""It saves on processing power. Making a sphere takes a lot of different polygons, it's hard for the lighting engine to work around all those angles and then you have to worry about fluid dynamics if she starts bouncing."" Another pause as he stared off into the middle distance. I took the moment to grab the bowl and take a hot for myself. ""Having a flat surface with a simple texture is a lot easier for the processor to manage.""

I finally managed the jump over the fence and raced it toward one of the waiting jet fighters. After a drawn out animation of my character ripping at the door I was gunned down. My roommate stirred again.

""I once saw this gif of a game engine loading and deleting things in real time as the player looked around the world."" He was prone to stoned lecturing. Sometimes it was a lecture on the girls I've been talking to, sometimes muddled politics, sometimes rankins of frozen pizza. Apparently tonight's speech was sponsored by his computer science 101 course. ""The game just deleted anything out of the scene that the player wasn't looking at so it wouldn't have to render useless points. I think the even designed levels so the player would walk past high detail set pieces and spend most of their time in dungeons with just four, easy to render, blank walls.""

I was beginning to feel the weed too at this point. My reflexes were slowed down to the point that I could no longer jump into the high speed car chases. ""So the developers spent years building beautiful set pieces and then shove the player into a blank room just to save on FPS?"" I was suddenly aware of how bleak our small cinder block dorm was. ""If that's all they care about, why bother with the 3D world at all? Why not just push people into a simple 2D world?""

The blazed college philosopher scratched his chin, trying to imagine his play as a human enslaving robot. ""People evolved to live in a 3D world. It's what comes naturally to us. We would go crazy in just 2D."" He dug out the cached bowl and repacked it. ""I guess ontop of all the other things they could just design the game so the player spends most of their time looking at simple, 2D objects."" 

I handed off the controller to my dorm mate. ""How the hell would you do that?"" I asked just before I jumped ship from the conversation. My roommate rambled on, but I was a little too gone to join in. I spent the rest of the night srating at my phone.",shortscarystories
"For months it was just an annoying sound.

My boyfriend never snored before and it wasn’t a snore anyway. It was a wheeze really but bad enough so I didn’t get a wink of sleep most nights. Eventually, we agreed on what we laughingly called a ‘sleep divorce.’

I continued to sleep in our bedroom and Ed (that’s my boyfriend), he started taking the guest room.

The solution should have been total. But I could still hear the wheezing through the wall.

\*\*\*

Sleeping away from someone you love on a regular basis is really unsustainable though.

On weekends and holidays we let the whole thing slide and slept together. The noise he made was still annoying but if I had nowhere to be the next morning I could deal with it.

\*\*\*

After living this way for more than a year Ed’s breathing problem started to get better. We just reckoned he’d lost some weight or that his switching to decaf had done the trick.

Ed stopped sleeping in the guest room and our sex life got a little bit crazy after that. I *still* wasn’t getting much sleep but circumstances matter and this was a *way* better reason for insomnia.

\*\*\*

One night, after making love, I fell asleep with my head on Ed’s neck.

The wheezing started again.

I was so comfortable I didn’t want to move. I just lay there listening to the annoying sound.

I was just about to sit up and make Ed go to the guest room again when I got the sharpest pain in the side of my face, exactly where my skin made contact with his.

I shot up, yelled and grabbed at my face. I was bleeding.

Despite my having screamed, Ed hadn’t moved. He was still laying out flat and that weird wheezing noise was still issuing from his throat.

I never even took the time to work out why Ed was so unresponsive. I ran to the bathroom and looked in the mirror.

My face in the mirror was all dotted with perfectly round perforations. They were still painful to the touch at first but the more I ran my fingers over them the better they felt and then the weirdest sensation came over me: The holes in my face felt *good*. Better than good. It was like every spot where my skin had been broken was a sexual organ and every sexual organ was going into overdrive with orgasm after orgasm.

I laughed at my reflection in the mirror.

I ran back to our bedroom to tell Ed. He still hadn’t sat up. He was still laying there: wheezing, unconscious.

Then I saw the things protruding from his neck, the same things that had punctured my face and sent my skin spiralling into the euphoric state I couldn’t shake even now.

I laughed.

The tendrils in Ed’s neck quivered and whined. They were calling me back to bed.

I went.",shortscarystories
"Honestly, it didn’t take long. I remember a time when we all thought it was so far off, that nothing like this could happen in our fragile lifetimes. Looking back, it’s almost laughable.   

I’ve been spending my last few days watching videos of how things were; I found a box of DVDs with permanent marker written on them. I have no idea who the people in the videos are, but they were filled with recordings of celebrations. Birthdays, Christmas, New Years; there was even one in the pile labeled ‘Family Reunion’. It’s a bit strange to see that someone out there still put videos on DVDs, it’s such an old way of doing things, but, if nothing else, I’m grateful. It’s been a pleasant escape from existence.   

Of course the nostalgia has been putting some strange thoughts in my head. How did we end up where we are? How did get forced into this situation? Sure, these thoughts are fruitless, but I’ve never been one for fruit, so I decided to entertain them.   

I feel like most people would say that we were apathetic, and that’s what brought us here. At least that’s what they would say, if they weren’t mostly dead, and maybe they’d be right. It’s not hard to get wrapped up in your own life, uncaring of how everyone else is living. Why should I care if my neighbor 2 doors down the way had a bad day and decided to drunkenly take it out on his wife; not really my problem.    

Some would probably also push that it was caused by politics; the never-ending squabbling between opposite ends of the same spectrum. More like two sides of the same coin, but I don’t think it would have made a difference. Sure, the people voted for their leaders, others voted for who they wanted. Sitting here today, it doesn’t really feel like the end of everything was partisan. Death is indiscriminate, it doesn’t care who you voted for, it doesn’t care what you considered wrong or right. Ironically, so are bombs, missiles, bullets… they all just kind of do their own thing.   

Now, if you were to ask me, I think it was ignorance. We did all we could to steer the country, the world, in the ‘right direction’, we were charitable to some extent. There was even a brief moment when everything was set into motion where we loved our fellow man. Again, laughable. The sirens wailed, the skies lit up, the cities burned, and we wanted to help each other? By then it was too late, everything had been set into motion. The steps chosen to start anew were already being followed, and with those three simple words, we would all meet our end. With those three simple words, we would get what we deserved; our penance for our apathy, our fighting, the wars, the murder, everything our species had ever done.   

It was then that we were Baptized By Fire.",shortscarystories
"It came suddenly.

Without warning.

For the first time in years.

I thought it wouldn’t happen again.

I thought I could fight it off.

I had taken so many precautions.

I had built walls around me.

I thought the urge had gone away.

I thought I was better.

And yet.

I found myself in the bathroom.

Again.

With my X-Acto knife in my hand.

Again.

Kneeling down next to the bathtub.

Again.

Watched my hand travel upwards.

Again.

Felt the cold metal against my skin.

Again.

Felt the knife pierce the jugular.

Again.

Heard the skin break.

Again.

Watched the blood pour into the bathtub.

Begging for mercy.

For forgiveness.

But no.

This is for the better.

This is good.

"There’s a man in my yard, covered in blood. 

Is it my imagination that shows me the man covered in blood? 

My family is gone, the house flooded with blood. My family never believed I saw things they couldn’t. I always heard voices and saw things I shouldn’t. 

But now they are gone, and there’s a man in my yard covered in my families blood. 

They should’ve listened to me when I said it was real. Losing my family was something I feared. 

What’s next? Well I guess I should go inside and wash the blood off my clothes, take care of the bodies so they’re no longer exposed.

"Miles sat in the room, listening to the doctors whisper worriedly outside, and wondered if he ought to begin to panic.

He’d been at the hospital for five hours now, the last three seeing more and more tests. What had started as only a persistent headache was clearly something far worse, but no one could be bothered to actually clue Miles in as to what that was.

Finally the door opened and a number of people walked inside, looking anxious.

“Mr. Finxley, my name is Dr. Ashcromb, and this is Dr. Pattel and Dr. Huxton. We just have a few questions for you concerning some results we got back...”

“Okay,” Miles gulped, wiping his hands on his legs.

“Mr. Finxley, what’s your profession again?”

“I’m a realtor. You know, selling houses.”

“Right...and Mr. Finxley, in your line of work, do you travel outside often? Say to the country, perhaps?”

Miles nodded, confused. “Yeah, I have a few properties I’m selling out there right now.”

“Any of those properties near a farm? Say one with lots of agriculture?”

“I...yeah, one is, yes. Why?”

“Mr. Finxley...we don’t really know how to tell you this, but we’ve triple checked the results and even sent samples to quite a few other facilities, but you...well, you have Ustilago Maydis.”

“Oh god...wait, what is that? Is it bad?”

“It’s...well, we’ve never actually seen a case with a person before, but we—don’t know.”

“What do you mean, never seen a case with a person? And what exactly is it you say I’ve got?”

“It’s called ‘Ustilago Maydis’, Mr. Finxley, also known as...Corn Smut. It’s a type of fungus that infects a localized area with tumor-like growths, some up to a foot in diameter. Before today, it was something that only affected crops of corn.”

“So—so you’re saying I’ve got corn tumors? Are you fucking mad!?”

“Mr. Finxley, please, calm down! We know this must be distressing, but what we’re saying is true. It’s developed at an alarming rate, and is responsible for the growth on your head.”

“Growth on my...what the hell are you talking about!?” Miles shouted, trying to get the doctors to look him in the eye. Surely they weren’t serious.

“The, ah, growth, Mr. Finxley, above your right ear. The one that’s been steadily increasing in size for the past two hours.”

Miles laughed, shaking his head. Now he knew they were mad. There wasn’t a growth on his—

Horrified, he looked into the mirror the doctor had held up, and slowly reached a hand towards his ear. There, sitting thick and bulbous, was a hideous growth.

“What...what’s going to happen to me?” Miles asked as the doctors began slowly backing out of the room.

“We don’t know, Mr. Finxley, but we’re going to keep you here a bit longer while we wait to find out. If you’ll excuse me, I’m just going to step out and grab an Ibuprofen—I seem to have the worst headache...”",shortscarystories

"  
We were living in your house and were there when you came to see the house with the so-called estate agent. We monsters as you call us are not ugly, in fact, we are selected on our good looks, the better we look the better are we able to sell houses!  


Most 'monsters' of our kind will be just home owners wanting to sell and move on. On to greener pastures, greener virgins! Some of us are estate agents.  


It is not easy these days to find a real virgin and we need virgin blood to survive. The virgin in her new house will serve to feed my family one time, or for a very long time if she wants to feed us. But virgins do not remain virgins very long. And the fourteen year old girls you believe are still free of the love of men more often are not. They have been taken already.  


Promiscuity is a bad thing and priests, uncles, cousins, granddads or even daddies themselves are often found guilty of deflowering a virgin family member. So there I am, selling a nice family house to a nice family with an eleven, twelve or thirteen year old girl. But at her fourteenth birthday instead of getting sweet, nutritious virgin blood, we have to make do with the sour blood of a deflowered girl. So we try to meet the girl young and tell her to keep her virginity until the famed day.  


It is not so easy to come back to people who believe you are their estate agent and try to become friends of the family, but sometimes it works out well. Especially if the family just moved in to a new town or city and have no local connections, no friends in the neighborhood. That family will find it a relief to take us into their home at times. They invite us for dinner or lunch.  


Late night dinners are nice because you can suck some blood off a grandmother or a mother after a few glasses of wine. She will not notice and the dehydration and headache will be blamed on the hangover. The men in a household are usually careful of their women. So we only suck from the wife if they both fall asleep late at night.  


Their blood will only last for a few days, so we need a lot of friends to stay alive. Virgin blood will keep us cool for nearly a year, and she does not notice too much. If she stays a virgin after her fourteenth birthday we can enjoy more years together. If she is willing to join us, all the better!  


Your estate agent has a very good looking ‘daughter’ just a few years older than yours, do make friends, we bloody love it!",shortscarystories
"She was paralysed. Why would she turn around to the voice of her boyfriend when he was standing in front of her, silent and still?
She figured it might be a hallucination or a dream! It had to be, right? Why would her boyfriend’s disembodied voice be telling her to kill herself while he was standing, smiling at her, getting ready to go to bed?
She just couldn't take it, every single sentence seemed to be equally as dangerous as the last, but it kept getting worse.
The longer she stared at Him, the more he seemed to scowl.
Was he smiling? Or was he snarling at her?
It just had to stop, the voice kept getting louder, more darker, more... terrifying.
She couldn’t notice it at first but the room was dark. Darker than before.
After what seemed like years, he finally turned around and tucked himself deep under the blankets.
She still couldn’t move,
The blankets felt unusually cold as she slowly descended into them, she kept blinking, trying to keep the tears away.
This couldn’t be happening, this shouldn’t be happening.
The voice started to scream, started to shout nonsense into her ears.
The room went dark, the last remaining candle burning out and her starting to quietly sob. Why was he here, he shouldn’t be here! How was he here?
She sighed, eventually calm.
Until the cold bony fingers hugged her waist and pulled her into a freezing embrace.
All calm was swept away, her boyfriend hugged her passionately but also dangerously, she felt the anger inside him as he laid there, breathing deeply into her neck. Her boyfriend, was cuddling her, in her bed, in the middle of the night.


This would make her ecstatic, joyful! except for the fact Her boyfriend died 4 years ago...",shortscarystories
"Mom gives me a pissed-off look when I get into the truck.

I’m late.

“You’re getting fat,” she says.

“Mom! It’s just the coat. It’s freezing outside!”

She sighs, like she always does when she’s in the wrong.

“You look like a turkey,” she continues. “A stuffed turkey.”

Mom’s stressed over Christmas.

We drive to the mall in silence. She catches me looking at a group of colt-legged girls walking through the drifting snow.

“How will you ever meet a nice girl if you don’t take care of yourself?”

“Mom” —

“Lawrence, I’m worried about you. About your future.”

I don’t reply. I think of the forum, of the supportive messages. Of Omar.

*I’m proud of you son,* he’d said. 

*You’re special.*

We park and get out. I tell Mom I want to check out Santa. She rolls her eyes but says nothing.

Inside it’s warm. Christmas decorations are everywhere. My bulky coat looks absurd.

We walk past Santa on the way to the supermarket. A large plastic tree, a long line of kids. Under the tree, some washed-up actor in red clothes and a fake white beard.

I’m pink-faced and sweaty. It’s so hot in my coat.

When I stop, Mom sighs again. “Larry, I’m going to get the turkey,” she says. Then: “You really *do* have to grow up.”

She waddles off, her big butt swaying in her leggings.

She always wears leggings, even when it’s cold.

It’s cheap. I told Omar and he agreed.

*Whoreish*, he called it.

I stand next to Santa. He’s young and annoyed by the kids around him.

He looks at me. “Aren’t you too big for this?” he whispers. There’s alcohol on his breath.

Omar’s right. It’s filthy. Perverse.

*That’s why you’re special*, he’d said. *It’s rare for one of you to find the truth*.

I’m sweating heavily.

*With your blue eyes and blond hair, nobody will suspect*.

The colt-legged girls from before come into the mall.

Omar, Omar, I know you’re right, but I’m scared, my hand is on the zip but I can’t move —

The girls come closer. A little boy in a red jumper sits on Santa’s knee.

*Ho ho ho.*

One of the girls is wearing leggings. Just like Mom.

I think of Mom buying a big, fat turkey. She’ll stuff it while she tells me, Larry you disappointment, Larry you with your big belly and your PS4 games and Pornhub and —

I tear open the zip. My coat opens to reveal the thick slabs of explosives coated with nails.

They all stare, open-mouthed. They see me now, Santa and the woman with the leggings, they see me for what I have become these last few months on the forum.

Not one of the lost, but one of the found. Not a soul in turmoil, but a seeker of paradise. Not a sheep, but a lion.

A beautiful, wrathful lion.

“Alhamdulillah!” I scream and grip the detonator. “Merry Christmas, filthy kuffir pigs!”

"They were discovered on every continent. In wastelands and desolate fields, structures with spikes of concrete and steel, scribbled with ancient languages. Numerous languages, each plate was different. You have never seen anything like it. No-one has. The youths climb over the spiked walls, to study the concrete ruins inside. While the inside is desolate as well, countless of little treasures are brought over, gifted to families and lovers. Chunks of stone and concrete, ancient screws and nails, to be tied to jewels and necklaces as tokens of luck and magic. 

All who can climb cross the wall, to dig the dirt, raiding the area more and more barren, taking along the tokens they can. But for ten years the elders study the scriptures. Once two have been solved, they learn: all the scriptures stare the same.

"In a not-distant future, apocalypse came,   
But one husband and wife in the backwoods remained.   
To their fortified homestead, the Halversons tended,   
Some months since the world as they knew it had ended.   

Outliving their loved ones, they knew time was short,   
They had to act fast or there’d be an onslaught.   
Both of their plans were different as could be.   
The man sought to fight while his wife sought to flee.   

“Let’s build our defenses and stay at the house!”   
The frustrated husband felt compelled to shout.   
“No monsters can break in if our vault is strong.   
It’s the only reason we’ve lasted this long!”   

The upset wife spat a response of her own.   
“All barriers fall- see the rest of the town!   
Our only hope now is to hop in our jeep.   
There’s survivors out there I know we can reach.”   

Unable to come to an answer through logic,   
Each bickering party avoided the topic.   
While bunker and jeep were both workable options,   
Pride kept the couple from settling on one.   

But as Christmas neared, resolves slowly slipped.   
A side effect of the holiday spirit.   
Also changing their minds? The disturbing fact   
That winter-time was when most hellbeasts attacked.   

On that Christmas Day, with past tensions lifted,   
The couple sat down to learn what had been gifted.   
With wrapped goods exchanged from the local junk trader,   
Dear husband teared up and told wife what he gave her.   

“I *was* wrong to put down your plan to escape.   
Life isn’t worth living if hidden away.   
So, I sold the steel lock to our blast bunker door,   
And bought litres of fuel for our getaway car.”   

Instead of rejoicing, the wife’s face looked pained.   
T’was her turn now to have her present explained.   
As a screeching, demonic mob bolstered outside,   
An emotional wife choked back sobs and replied.   

“You *were* right in your plan to hunker down tight.   
We’re expecting a child, we can’t risk his new life.   
So, I pawned the tires to our all terrain jeep,   
And got sensor alarms for downstairs when we sleep.”   

Mere minutes from monsters all breaching the walls,   
The poor lovers mourned their ironic shortfalls.   
With nowhere to hide, and nowhere to run.   
The Halversons died as fiends dismembered them.",shortscarystories
"In every room, there is a corner so shrouded by dark that, when bedtime comes, no child can make out what is beyond the fold of the wall. They talk, blubber about a shifting beast that can only just be seen while their eyes are just about to close.


The creature spreads throughout the room, hanging upon every nook and cranny like hellish Christmas decorations, rotting from generations past. No one has seen beyond its shadow. Only when you sleep do you see its real form.


Laying on your back, looking so at the ceiling. The air prickles like icicles. You are not alone. Up in the dreaded corner, you see him.


A long body with naked limbs and a scaly body. Sweat falls onto you, giving you a wretched answer to the cold prickling. 


A face that had a wide, crooked, toothless grin and two beady eyes that lusted for blood.


Its neck defies its own form, stretching itself like a slug until it meets the end of your bed. Now his body is nonexistent; only a nub of flesh remains. It starts to crawl to come together with its head.


It rises, a cobra of disgusting proportions. The moment to strike is awaiting its foul hunger. The face leans in, ignoring your silent but terrified efforts to run.


“Now has come the time to play,” he rasps, “and you shall be my toy. The man is finally finished making you into my image. You have been a very naughty dolly...you wouldn’t want to break again, would you?”


He wraps around you, his flesh all but merging with yours.


“*Mrs. Polly had a dolly who was SICK, SICK, SICK*

*So she called for the doctor to come QUICK, QUICK, QUICK*

*He came with his BAG and he came with his HAT*

*And he hid in the corner to KILL THE BRAT!*”


His own body sunk into yours, smothering you into the inky darkness below the covers. He slithered away once the deed had been done.

"I’ve been sent back to kill bad people. And only the bad.

The technology where I’m from lets me leap through time.

Like a routine morning, such is the speed and spontaneity with which I wake up to a new setting. This one a cold December afternoon. The middle of a forest.

Then I see it: a red pick-up parked twenty feet away.

I pulled the pistol out of my pocket. Lunged toward the window on the driver’s side. 

A chubby nine-year-old boy sat in the passenger’s seat. A backpack at his feet. His face beyond nervous.

Behind the wheel, a tall man leaned back. He was even chubbier. His smile growing wider as he unbuckled his khakis. 

Using the pistol, I tapped on the window. Startled the two.

In a burst, the kid snatched his backpack and ran into the forest.

The man struggled to slide his pants back on.

I pointed the pistol down.

His perverse pleasure fading, the man lowered the window. “Is something the matter?” he asked in a raspy Chicago accent.

“Yeah,” I responded. I put the gun to his head. “You.”

I pulled the trigger. The top of his head exploded. Like confetti, blood and gray matter scattered everywhere.

The man fell back. His body forever preserved in its sickening final few moments.

I walked toward the woods. Saw the boy in a clearing. 

Crying, the kid faced me.

""It’s okay!” Putting the pistol in my pocket, I leaned down. “I didn’t mean to scare you.”

“What are you gonna do?” the boy said.

I placed my hands on his shoulders. “I’m just here to help.”

“I'm sorry...” the boy said.

Uneasy, I saw what lurked behind him.

I saw the backpack next to a couple of charred turkeys. Each of them burnt alive. Their eyes bulging. Their dead tongues hanging out for a final gasp at life.

The weapons were unusual but effective: balloons. Each filled with gasoline.

“I just couldn’t help it, mister,” the kid said, his voice simultaneously innocent and tormented.

My horrified gaze drifted to a box of matches. Five of them freshly struck.

“I had to do something,” the kid continued.

Weeping, I faced him. “I know, John.”

His eyes grew bigger. “How'd you know my name?”

I gripped his shoulder as I stood up. “Just come with me.”

I led us past the turkeys. Past one of John's first crime scenes. 

In the forest, I didn’t bother holding back tears. Didn’t suppress my shivers as I reached into my pocket. For the gun.

1951 never felt colder. I couldn’t blame the snow since there wasn’t any in Chicago that day. Only the chilling company I made. The looming execution of John Wayne Gacy. A portrait of a serial killer at a young age I had to erase.

The ages were the hardest part about the missions. Not executing evil. But having to do so before they reached their peak. When they were just children.",shortscarystories
"It was late so I decided to take a shortcut, I knew this block had a bad reputation.

The street was quiet, only noise being my growling stomach. Father is going to be furious, I missed lunch and was late for dinner.

I thought about all the times he mistreated me, forbidden me my childhood.

My dark thoughts got interrupted:

""Hey kid, what's the hurry little man.

I froze, my mind racing, what should I do?

A tall man approached me, followed by two.

""Do you have any spare change little man?""
The left thug said, while the right one was rummaging my pockets.

""Empty""

""We can't have you crossing this street without any contributions, now can we?""

""Or do you think he's old enough for a beating""

Shifting from left to right like they rehearsed this, the tall man staring me down.

""Father has money"" I said without thinking.

""Well where is your hospitality, invite us over""

As the doorbell rang adrenalin rushed, outside was freezing but my blood was searing hot.
The door opened slowly, fathers face unchanged by what was in front of him, he was always a cold calculated bastard.

""We're here for a donation"" said the smallest thug grinning, while his lowlife friend pushed me. The door closed, everyone exchanged glances.

""Give us your valuables and everyone can have a good evening""

After a pause father finally spoke ""No""

The tall man took a deep sigh, shifting his jacket revealing a gun.

""Trust me when I say you won't carry your valuables to the grave""

Agitated by no reaction he pulled his gun

""You think we are joking"" waiving the gun in my face ""Give us your money or say goodbye to the kid""

The two thugs surrounded me, I tried to make a noise but each time the air was kicked out of my lungs.

""So what's it gonna be old man""

""I guess his time has come""

I couldn't believe what he said, before I had time to react three loud bangs echoed. My boiling blood drenched the carpet, they turned on father.

My ears were buzzing from loud gunshots, the thugs didn't hear me get up, they didn't hear muffled gasps of pain as my nails grew, my skin tore, my fangs forming a perfect bite.

Everything was red, even before I took the first thugs head clean off. The tall man was barely up to my shoulders now, his slow reaction to turn his gun was interrupted by dismemberment.

His blood tasted of fear.

The smallest thug fell, eyes wide in horror, mouth babbling nonsense. I tried to hold back, I really did, but the bloody rags hanging from my claws could not be classified as human anymore.

I looked into fathers dark yellow eyes:

""Thank you for letting me hunt today""

""It was finally your time"" he muttered, picking a gold chain from the remains ""Besides, he was right, you don't take your valuables to the grave"".",shortscarystories
"My friend Dawson has always wanted to make movies. He spent a lot of time writing scripts and messing around with the cheap camcorder that his family kept in the attic. Honestly, he wasn't that bad either. He dabbled a bit in a few genres but horror seemed to be his best fit out of all of them. By no means was he the next John Carpenter but if he kept at it with as much passion as he showed he could definitely make something of himself. 

Eventually one of his short films caught some traction online and he gained a bit of popularity. He ended up getting a new camera and was even contacted by some amateur actors in our area who wanted to be in his next film. I noticed a slight change in Dawson around this time. I was always around his shoots just to help out and he thought I had a natural ability in front of the camera. I had made a few small appearances here and there but I much preferred working behind the scenes. Helping him write was my real passion, but he insisted I take part in a role for his next project. 

He became somewhat of directorzilla even towards me. He would yell and shout that we weren't selling our emotions well enough. I reminded him many times that these weren't professional actors and that I was doing him a favor by even being in his movie. There was one scene in particular that he lost his shit on me and the other actress. 

We had to have done over 50 takes in one day before I blew up on him and walked off the set. While cooling down the actress working in my scene came to talk to me and let me know Dawson decided to wrap for the day. I went home and debated whether I should even show up the next day. A call from Dawson that included an apology convinced me to change my mind.

The next day Dawson seemed more upbeat than usual. He still looked kind of out of it but other than that he seemed normal again. We set up the shot without a hitch and when Dawson yelled ACTION I made it my goal to get this shit done in one shot.

To my surprise, my co-actress sold the scene incredibly well. I had never seen such emotion on her face. It was genuinely scary at how shocked she looked when the fake knife made contact with her stomach. I thought to myself that she must have been practicing all night. 

That was until she stepped back and the fake knife was still inside of her. I also didn't remember anyone setting up the fake blood just yet. It took probably a full ten seconds for me to realize what had just happened and when I turned to Dawson who looked more manic than ever as he fist-pumped the air and yelled SCENE.",shortscarystories

"I always loved to put up posters on my walls but ever since I was little, I could see the lips of people on them move, but only during the night.

At first it scared me, my brain not being able to process what the hell I was seeing. After a while I started to make up conversations. Nothing weider than laying in bed, looking at your Jonathan Taylor Thomas poster and imaging an entire conversation.

As I got older the imaginary conversations in my head stopped but the lips never stopped moving. 

I just assumed it was some sort of trick of the mind and maybe everyone saw it but no one talked about it. Until last night.

I was alone, getting ready for bed as always when I heard a whispering sound. I figured it was the neighbors or something, thin walls, ya know?

"*THWAP*

It was the peak of summer, and the flys were everywhere. You open a window and seconds later you've got a bunch of the little buggers in your house. 

*THWAP* 

I let the fly swatter relax in my hand and admired my work. Fly guts were smeared and splattered all along the window, their bodies contorted in a vast spectacle of wings and carapaces. 

God, they just kept on coming! Somehow, their numbers continued escalating; I must've killed thousands over the last few weeks. I gingerly twirled the fly swatter. I'll be ready for 'em as they come. 

I sat down and looked at the window, gazing as the lush green of summer slowly faded into dusk. 

A small black shape landed on the glass directly in my line of sight. Another damn fly. At least this one wasn't in my house. Yet. I went up to the window and tapped, hoping to scare it away. 

It didn't move. 

It fluttered its wings, and, as if on cue, another insect landed on the window. And then another. 

Goddamn. I just knew that these would end up in my house at some point. Nothing I could do about it now, though. 

Yawning, I directed myself upstairs, ready to turn in for the night. As I was brushing my teeth, a fly landed on the mirror. With deliberation, almost delicately, I pulped it into oblivion with the flat of my hand. 

I sighed in irritation and washed my hands of its guts. 

I heard more buzzing as I was laying down, but was too tired to do anything about it. Slowly, I fell asleep. 

Only to wake up what felt like minutes later. The buzzing was all around me, a deafening chorus. There was a glittering dark fog in the room, a fog that was scintillating and twirling, constantly moving. I tried to brush it away with my hands and felt it give way, only to be replaced minutes later. Everything was dark. 

Suddenly, I couldn't breathe.

I felt shapes forcing their way into my mouth. I bit down and felt small bodies crushed by my teeth, felt guts and slime dribble down my chin. Soon, there were too many bugs in my mouth too bite down on. I couldn't breathe. 

They were pushing their way into my throat. I could feel the light hairs on their bodies tickling my insides. I gagged, tears streaming down my eyes. I couldn't breathe.

Insects were plugging up my nose. They were in my ears. I felt some squeezing their way under my eyelids. I couldn't breathe. 

Small bright stars flashed before my eyes despite the utter darkness created by the miasma of fluttered insects. I fell to my knees, then onto my side, sputtering and twitching. Flys crawled over every inch of my body. Weakly, I stretched out an arm. 

I... couldn't... breathe...",shortscarystories
"It was 2 months ago that we heard the first song of the birds, it was loud and unnerving. When it ended, nothing seemed out of the ordinary, except one person named Peter Mueller from Saint Petersburg had disappeared. Just out of thin air, it was witnessed by his son. Nothing was thought about it until 6 months later..

It happened again, and this time another person went missing, and so the reign of terror began, 3 months later another song and another missing.

Then 1 month later, then a week, then a day, then an hour, and now it's down to minutes.

"Lying here in a pool of blood, I really regret many things in my life.

I should  have known better than to be enticed by you. I should have known better than being in this mess...

If you ask me how it started, I think at the coffee shop . 

Nope.

Maybe at the bus stop.

 Oh I know, it started at the hospital.

I was at the hospital to meet a friend. If I hadn't gone there that day I wouldn't have had to take the bus to get back home. I wouldn't have craved coffee standing there and decide I needed a coffee to get through that day. I wouldn't have opened the cafe door to bump into someone. I would not have been attracted to the guy and his smile. I wouldn't have been chirping all day long only to bump into him in front of the bookstore in the evening and deciding that it's fate.

Anyway it happened. We met. We fell in love. We promised happily ever after. We stayed together for a year.  

That was the honeymoon period. Soon the castles we built broke down. The fate we were sure of never existed. Our forever was short-lived. He became suspicious. He became possesive. 

Don't do that. Don't do this. Don't look at others. I am the only one for you, he said.  And then  we rolled right from our bliss to violence. And finally today he hit me. All the lines were crossed today. I should have known that it won't be a happy ending a long time ago.

 Today things got out of control. Everything was sudden.

He hit me . 

I slammed into the desk. He was about to hit my head. But he never raised his hand on me again. The stab from the screwdriver was enough to take him aback. The second stab right into his chest was enough to make him look surprised. I smiled. He had woken up the me who the doctor had forced into sleep. 
 
I twisted the screwdriver  and stabbed him again and again. 13 times more. Just to make sure he doesn't live. No one who crosses me should be alive. My other self who loved him was a fool. No one can belittle me. 


Lying here in a pool of blood, she must really regret many things in her life.

Lying here in a pool of blood she  should  have known better than to be enticed by you.

However lying here in a pool of blood was the most satisfying thing I have felt in a while. Lying in a pool of blood- his blood.",shortscarystories
"Have you ever thought about how you’re going to die?

Not in the sense of your own mortality, but the specific details of your death. Like how you would react, who would mourn you, what would happen after you pass and your body decomposes and your relatives forget about you and you just quietly fade into nothing...?

These were not thoughts I’d had until ten minutes ago, when the storm hit.

It was supposed to be fun. An exciting way to bring in the New Year, partying on a yacht with your parents and all their best friends. But you can’t help but feel down as you sneak another Jack and Coke from the table up top and slip away below deck. Because this isn’t fun. You hate it here. And you hate everyone else on this stupid boat, too. But what can you do? Everyone else is having a good time. Everyone else is drinking, and dancing, and partying it up. 

And then you notice the storm clouds. And before you can even enjoy the irony of it all, people are screaming as they’re blown oversea, the rain pelting down with an angry vengeance and the wind whipping debris left and right and the ocean churning madly as wave after wave rocks the boat, and there’s no way it can take another hit, but there’s no sign of the storm stopping...

And then nothing. For who knows how long. Long enough for you to frantically grab at a floating piece of wood, but not long enough for the storm to be over.

So you float. And wait. And think of death. Of what is happening to the bodies of everyone as the wreckage of the yacht is finally swallowed whole over to your left, far enough away that you’re spared getting dragged down with it, but then wondering if that wouldn’t have been such a bad thing after all. Because now there’s nothing.

Nothing but the night sky, the rain, the wind, and you. Alone in the world, adrift, struggling to stay afloat and wondering what will happen when you let go. There are no other survivors, which you don’t know how to feel about as you kick to stay up, your voice weary from shouting. No one coming to the rescue.

Just the relentless downpour of rain above you, the stinging wind against your cheeks, the numbness in your legs as the cold slowly starts to creep up your skin and you find it harder and harder to keep moving them. You need to keep moving them. But they’re so heavy, and it’s so dark out, and you don’t know what’s below, but it has to be better than this, right? Better than just slipping off the wood, only a bit at first, then completely, and trying to keep your head up. Because it’s so wet out. And cold. And dark. Nothing could be worse than this.

Except maybe a faint nibble on your toe from below.",shortscarystories
"I couldn’t concentrate on my work, so I decided to get up and go for a walk. I was sure that the cold winter air would clear the fog in my head. I put on a coat, a hat, and gloves in front of a large mirror. I glanced up at my reflection, smiled, and opened the door. 

The sun was still out when I walked outside. As I was walking, I saw a kid on a tricycle on the other side of the street. I grimaced, remembering my youth and when I asked for my father to teach me how to ride a tricycle. My father always said he was busy. Yet he was jobless and never did anything with my mother. My pace grew a little quicker. 

Suddenly, I heard a loud pop and a scream. I immediately thought someone had been slapped, so I rushed to the window of the house from where the sound came from. I let out a sigh of relief when I realized it was just a champagne bottle being opened and the classic scream of surprise. Yet I tended up again as I was reminded of my father opening a beer, drinking, and then drunkenly slapping me across the face. Another champagne bottle opened, and I backed away slowly as sweat poured down my face, the pop sounding even more like a beating. I started to run away. 

I turned a corner, and almost ran into a couple. I recognized them as my neighbors. “Hey, how are you?” the wife asked. I opened my mouth, but not a word came out, as my focus was on her. Her face reminded me of my wife’s face. Ex-wife, actually. She got a divorce due to my alcoholic tendencies, the one thing my father gave to me. “Hello?” she said again, making me snap back to reality. I could feel sweat drip down my back, and it suddenly felt like a hot summer day. I began to stutter a response, and then I began to back away like before. 

And then I heard a baby crying. 

I turned sharply and saw a mother pushing a baby in a stroller. I stared at the baby intently. I had always wanted one, but my wife refused due to my alcoholism. Then, the baby started laughing, as if making fun of my constant loneliness. 

Tears ran down my face as I turned the other way and ran home. It was as if God made me go on a walk so he could taunt me with my sufferings. 

I reached my house, shut the door forcefully, but stopped in front of the mirror. I no longer saw a happy man. Instead, I saw a broken individual. 

And so, as with any bad day, I decided I needed a beer to forget about all this. I gave a faint smile, and felt joy knowing I had a great coping mechanism. 

And it was all thanks to Dad.",shortscarystories

The following transcript has been salvaged from the ruins of a failed government facility in Arizona. Minimal corruption has occurred.

———————————————————————

1. Before entering the tunnel, remove all religious and personal items and place them in the Safehouse

2. Once inside the tunnel, DO NOT speak unless spoken to, and especially don’t mention the smell

3. If you see a humanoid figure standing in the tunnel before entry, **DO NOT** avert your gaze and leave the entrance chamber, sealing the door once outside

4. Once inside the tunnel, **DO NOT LOOK BEHIND YOU** no matter what you see, hear, smell, or feel

5. Relating to rule 4: Once inside the tunnel, you may feel an intense fear of the dark, claustrophobia, or the sensation of being watched, but again, **DO NOT LOOK BEHIND YOU.** Keep your head fixed either forward or down at all times

6. The tunnel *will* seem longer and darker than expected, but do not panic. You will always find the exit if you follow these rules

7. A few hours inside the tunnel may cause a slight mental breakdown. This is dangerous and should be dealt with by keeping your eyes shut and applying pressure to your ears

8. If you see any light whatsoever inside the tunnel (other than the exit/entry chamber), lay on the ground, face to the floor, with your hood pulled over you until you hear the screaming fade

9. Inside the tunnel you may (rarely) hear crying behind of you. If this occurs, **run without looking back**

10. If you feel you’re being watched from above, **repeat the phrase “caeca tenebris” until the feeling fades.** You should know the pronunciation from your training

11. **If the feeling does not fade, turn on your flashlight and point it behind you.** It will go faster

12. If you meet any person(s) in the tunnel, answer *any* questions they have with “I’m not sure”. They will undoubtedly tell you their name, which will always be that of a friend, family member, or respected official. Once done introducing themselves, they will begin to resemble that person. **DO NOT TRUST THEM.** They will pretend to lead you to the exit, but what they won’t mention is that the exit they take you to is not that of the tunnel

13. Remember, if you see the exit, **always** call out to it before exiting. There will always be personnel in the exit chamber, and if there is no response, or if it is muffled and/or incomprehensible, call again. If you have called three times with no response, **repeat “ostende veritatis” until the mirage fades**, you should only need to say it once 

14. Upon reaching the exit, always mark off your name by circling it with the provided dagger

15. Once outside of the tunnel, after circling your name, evacuate the Exit Chamber and climb the stairs onto the Desert Level

16. **NEVER LOOK** *[File corruption]*",shortscarystories
"I always used to ate at this Italian restaurant. The family that run the business was a Italian family of 5. One friend at my university told me that the menu was very cheap and delicious. He told me that they made the best spaghetti with meatball and bolognese sauce he ever has tried.   


One day, I decided to go and that's when I tried that spaghetti. Damn, it was good. Every day I would go there and order some spaghetti. Yes, i gained a little bit of weight, but the family was very nice enough that they even told me that I could go to the restaurant and not pay because it was nice having company. Various times I ordered to go, but after a day it started to smell bad, even refrigerated, which was weird, but I didn´t care, I could just eat it at the restaurant.

After going various times, I found one day that they closed because the father was arrested. It was a shame, because not only because of that, but because I lost a family.  


Recently, I found one of the members of the family, the daughter, on Facebook and we arranged a meeting where she would explain to me how to make that delicious spaghetti. The only weird thing that she told me was to bring a black plastic bag and a very sharp knife.

"

	She was perfect and exactly what I needed. Her black hair cascaded down her back in long thick waves and her golden eyes bore straight into mine. It definitely helped that her parents had left town for the weekend because now I had my chance and I am going to take it. 

	The planing of this exact day has been in the works for 16 long years and even more if you consider the time it took to find such perfection. 

	Perfection has a way of hiding in the depths of this chaotic world sometimes its right under your nose and because of your inability to recognize you’ll never find it. But I have had many many years and in that time I’ve come across many creatures that appeared perfect only to eventually find the rot within. But this one is different I can tell. 

	The small crack in the mirror never seemed to bother her but today was different. For some unknown reason it was all she could think about. I watched her perfect limbs glide back and forth around the small room only to eventually find herself back at the dingy mirror picking at the growing crack. 

	At first she didn’t notice the black liquid that began to drip out of the mirror but when she did it only made her curiosity grow and thus she continued to pick at the mirror till her fingers bled and her iron filled blood intermingled with the inky black substance.

	Her slow pacing soon turned to a dance of some sort as she marveled the black liquid. She couldn’t figure out what it was but for some reason it fascinated her to her very core. She wanted more so she ran to the mirror and continued picking until the liquid poured out and the glass shattered slicing her pale skin. It didn’t bother her because the cold black substance made her feel whole. A feeling she had never known before.
	
	As the liquid slowly seeped into the cuts along her skin she felt so exhausted to tired to move so she sat among the shattered glass and strange liquid. She rested her head on the tiled wall as her eyes fluttered closed. 

	I finally had her now and I wasn’t going to let her go. While she slept I took my chance! I leaked into the cuts littering her body pushing her blood out onto the floor so I could take its place. Once I was in I flowed through her body making it mine. Like I said... she was perfection. I just had to have it!

	I woke on the bathroom floor and looked up to see the mirror with the tiniest of cracks. Today I filled it. There is no way I’m giving her back! 


	I’m hidden in plain sight yet you would never suspect me 

	I see your every move and I’ve learned to copy 

	What am I you ask while staring at the zit in the middle of your forehead 

	I’m your reflection, your doppelgänger, your worst nightmare and I want out!

	I want your life,
	I want your stuff,
	I want your job,

	But most importantly I want you.

	So I’ll wait until ya least expect it and ill get ya!

	And then you’ll be wanting out.",shortscarystories

It might be said:

Upon an altar, on his knees, with his hands clasped and head tucked into his navel, a priest rocks rhythmically. Although, I can't hear him, I'm certain he's praying, because his whole life has conditioned him to cope in no other way but that. I pity him; He is surrounded by his brethren's body parts, and ensured to enjoy the same fate. 

His tormentors encircle him, as their matriarch, perched on a make-shift throne, spectates at a distance. Though she has yet to participate in the festivities, all know that he is hers and dare not approach him. 

Despite the atmosphere, she is not amused, and both her patience and her time are wearing thin. She rises and moves toward him. As she approaches, the crowd parts, opening a pathway. Once she is close enough to him, she stoops by his side. The smell of garlic wafting from his pores, doubtlessly a necessary precaution on his part, undoes some of her formality.

She leans toward him, places her hand on his shoulder, and whispers in his ear. For a moment, he indulges doubt, but, repudiated by his lapse in faith, he rejects his uncertainty and cries out,  ""Forgive me father"". She howls to him, ""I thought you knew? There is no mercy child. Now tell me where she is. '' A long silence follows. Her patience can't be contained anymore; she sinks her fangs into his neck, disregarding the danger his garlic infused blood poses to her already dwindling life-force, and arrives at the answers she sought; the prophecy was a charade to facilitate this moment. With his dying breath the priest triggers a UV bomb.

The last of the footage is pitch black, the image sensor was mostly likely damaged by the bomb. So, I stop the footage, remove the SD card containing it, plug it in my device, and upload it to the global repository. We assumed the priest failed his mission, but it turns out that the queen of this hive didn't escape. The priest's sacrifice wasn't in vain.

The world's end coincided with vampirism's return, and unsurprisingly, both were brought to you by science. Hilariously, people thought it be AI that'd wipe us out. Ironically, it's what's been keeping us alive.

Unfortunately, I  won't get to see humanity's triumphant return though; I'm nearly out of ammo. I clutch the pendent hanging from my neck and open it. Inside it are pictures of my wife and son; they didn't survive the outbreak. My eyes swell with pain as memories of them trickle down my face. Then I inhale deeply; I'm ready.

The room floods with vamps. They defy gravity, crawling on the walls and the ceiling. I'm surrounded, now, but  I'll be damned if I let them have me. I take one last look at what those **BASTARDS** snatched from me, turn my gun to my chest and pull the trigger, but the firing pin only clicks.",shortscarystories
"I thought my roommate was a sleepwalker.  She didn’t believe me when I told her that I hear her outside my room every night, just talking.  She insisted that she’s *never* been a sleepwalker.

I wanted to prove to her that she was doing this, so I bought a cheap security camera and installed it over my door, pointed directly down where she would be standing.  That night, I went to sleep eager to wake up the next morning and show her my proof.  It was a petty squabble, but I was determined to be right.  

Sure enough, that night around 3:30, I woke to the sound of my roommate carrying on a conversation with herself, laughing at her own words.  I had left the light on in the hallway just outside my room, and could see the outline of her feet in the crack between the floor and the bottom of the door. 

I couldn’t hear everything she said, but I thought it would be interesting to listen back in the morning.  I thought about getting up and opening the door to wake her, as that would be pretty good proof in and of itself, but my bed was comfy, and I had the video anyway.  I chuckled a little, feeling vindicated that I now had my proof, then went back to sleep.  

First thing when I got up the next morning, I opened my laptop and pulled up the feed from the night before.  I sat, puzzled.  The camera didn’t catch...anything.  

She never came to my door.

And the only indication that I hadn’t been dreaming the entire situation, is that right at the 3:30 mark, laughter can clearly be heard.",shortscarystories
"Despite having turned 15 just a few short weeks ago, Abigail was still bothered by being left alone in the house. You’d think most teenagers would consider it their own little bubble of bliss; no parents, no rules. As long as no crazy parties were held and dad’s sacred beer stash remained untouched, there was nothing you couldn’t reasonably do.

Abigail, however, was too nervous to try much at all, and so she remained in one place most times her parents went out. Typically in her bedroom, where safety felt the strongest, but sometimes downstairs so she could cosy up on the couch and watch a good little comedy. 

“No monsters, right?”

She asked herself that and, embarrassingly, she had doubts. The girl was 15 now and yet she feared such things existing. It wasn’t necessarily their appearance, nor their wanting to hurt her or worse, but rather the way they gave chase. She imagined they would be faster than any other natural being in the world, and when they were in the middle of a hunt, nothing else mattered. All of their energy would be projected unto catching and destroying their prey.

And so, Abigail feared stairs. That familiar rush people get when they ascend a flight of stairs in the dead of night… that rush, I say, was magnified in Abigail to the point of being actual fear.

She had just finished a recording of her favourite show when the inevitable came to her mind; she was tired, and her bedroom was upstairs. Now came the time for her to face her demons and to climb those damned stairs. She could never fall asleep on the couch for too long, and would always wake up poorly-rested anyhow.

The moment she stood up, Abigail’s mind jumped into gear, as she had expected. Her imagination was crazy, and nothing quite stimulated it like the darkness.

Not only her eyes, but also her ears were playing games. Her own body conspired against her to throw the poor girl into a state of panic, refusing to let up until she got up those stairs and into the security of her well-lit bedroom.

She took her final steps out of the darkened living room and was met by the staircase dominating the hallway in wait for her presence. Abigail had no time to waste. This monster was running through the dark, the noises of that old home were instead its quietened growls and its frantic footsteps.

Abigail ran, harnessing her fear to speed up those stairs with all her strength.

Then, as always happened, by the time she was approaching the top, she felt that horrible rush be quashed by a feeling of relief, and of silliness. She knew there were no monsters. Her own senses had betrayed her, as they would surely do again. Perhaps next time she would be better prepared, she told herself.

She certainly, however, wasn’t prepared for the unfamiliar man stood waiting at the top.",shortscarystories

She would have loved this place, we were meant to go together.

However we had to depart due to some conflict.

*I can’t wait for my wife to come*

We were inseparable, we still are I would like to believe.

“The Black Hearted Lovers” the media called us.

The modern Bonnie and Clyde.

*I can’t wait for my wife to come*

Everyone knew about us, we were infamous across  the country.

Everywhere we went people cowered in fear.

She was the one who did the slaughter, I was the one who made it a piece of art.

Traveling across the United States with my wife and spreading chaos and fear, nothing that could beat that feeling.

Free from morals, laws and sanity.

*I can’t wait for my wife to come*

It was supposed to be an easy job, stitch together over 10 citizens and hung them on top of the Empire State Building like a twisted flag made of flesh and blood.

*I can’t wait for my wife to come*

Just looking at one of the female victims in the “wrong” way was enough to make my wife believe I was cheating on her.

*I can’t wait for my wife to come*

That Yandere bitch fucking stabbed me, litterally gutting me and telling me that if she could not have me no one could. 

*I can’t wait for my wife to come*

However it is not that bad in the end.

*I can’t wait for my wife to come*

The flames licking my flesh and the endless torture are almost endurable with the delight full background symphony of a million souls shrieking in pain and agony.

Hell is not that bad.

*I can’t wait for my wife to come*

But if only one more soul would join this symphony of pain and suffering, I can say with all my heart that I couldn’t be happier.

And I just can’t wait for my wife to come.

"My first thought was that I’d invited too many people to my New Year’s Eve party. 

I figured it would be okay - sure, I didn’t know all of the friends of friends of friends that were there, but I wasn’t about to kick them out into the snow. 

The TV was on, showing one of those programs that watches all the different performers and stuff in Times Square and around the country. Too many people were drunk. 

My next thought was something along the lines of “hey, it’s *really* dark outside.”

Sure, it was nearly midnight. But shouldn’t the moon be reflecting off the snow? Shouldn’t there be a glow behind the clouds in the sky? 

Turning away from the window, I heard the countdown start. 

Ten... nine... eight...

Damn, it’s *really* dark outside. 

Three... two... one!

As people started kissing each other and screaming “Happy New Year!”, every light went out. 

Everything went dead black. 

I fumbled along the walls in the dark, trying to make my way outside. Nobody’s phone was working; nobody could find a flashlight. 

I finally fell into the snow outside my door, and looked up at where I thought the sky should be. 

There was no doubting it.

"Its hard work with my son and we have had so many baby sitters who have walked out on the job because they couldn't handle our naughty son. A couple of months ago we hired a new baby sitter to look after our 12 year old boy whenever me and my wife needed a day out. Our boy was a little bigger than most 12 year old boys.

This baby sitter really got on well with my boy and she did an unusual thing and wrote rules on her body like her arms, feet, leg and even on her neck for our son to follow whenever she was looking after our boy. It worked because it was different. 

Last week when me and my wife went out I saw the baby sitter allowing our boy to write new rules on her arms and feet for him to follow, it really resonated with him. As me and my wife were enjoying being at a restaurant my phone started ringing and it was my son who called us using the baby sitters phone. 

""I broke all of the rules I had written on the baby sitter"" he kept on saying

Something was off and when me and my wife went home I observed that my son literally meant it, he broke the rules. When he wrote no violence on her right arm, he literally broke her right arm. When he wrote no breaking things on her left arm, he literally broke her left arm. On the baby sitters feet he wrote no evil thinking on both feet, which he broke both of the baby sitters feet. 

On her neck though he wrote no murdering and he snapped her neck to break the rule so that he could murder her, my son had murdered the baby sitter by literally breaking the rules.",shortscarystories
"It was dark, the kind of darkness where you can’t see your own hand. I can’t remember the last time I saw the sunlight. It was a distant memory but a pleasant one. It was one of the few that remained and I held onto it with all of my remaining will. Memories were really all I had left. Nona wouldn’t allow me to have anything else.
 
Nona’s rough scales and bristly hair rubbed my skin raw, her grip was powerful and she held me tight. Occasionally I felt her hot rancid breath in my face, it smelled of centuries old death and decay.  I used my right arm to awkwardly wipe her drool and spittle off of my face. My right arm was all I had, my left arm was pinned so tightly against Nona that I couldn’t feel it anymore. And my legs had been shattered and broken so many times that they just dangled lifelessly under me. I would have died from starvation long ago but Nona wouldn’t have that, she forced me against her teat. She forced me to swallow her foul milk so that she could keep me alive.
 
I could only feel shame and disgust as my own waste slid down my emaciated and useless legs. Nona would make strange mewling sounds and then use her long, warty  tongue to clean the waste off of me. I wanted to cry but I couldn’t, if I did Nona would panic and squeeze me until I blacked out. Last time that happened she had completely broken my wrist, it healed back but now my hand was permanently at a weird angle.
 
Nona’s brain was dead and rotted, she was completely insane. She had eaten every last one of her newly hatched children from her last true brood. She stomped upon their small bodies and ate them one by one. I was now her replacement “son”. Sometimes she would lay a batch of unfertilized eggs. After a few weeks they would start to rot and stink. She would go into a fit of rage when her fetid mind realized that they weren’t going to hatch. These moments were truly terrifying yet I hoped and prayed to every god I could think of that she would slip up in her rage and kill me. But she didn’t. She would break my bones and peel my skin off but after her fit she would start to nurse me back.
 
Today we were visited by another of her kind, a large male. He looked at me in disgust. I can only imagine what my broken human form looks like at this point, especially to one of them. I asked him to kill me. He ignored me and tossed some form of slop with rotten meat bits  down into our pit for Nona to consume.

I take a sip, studying them, they do look like they’ve been missing too much sleep, dark bags under the eyes, washed out complexions.

“Ok… Ok! I’ll handle it!” my tone sharp. 

Some things really aggravate me, especially before my coffee. 

Getting told what to do, and their sensitivity to these “visitors” are the top two and three this morning. Lack of work in this economy and giving gifts despite going bankrupt being the first.

This house has been in my family for generations, nobody had a problem here until we moved in. 

Periodically we get “visitors”. Ghostly forms floating through the house, moving things or talking loudly. She suggested we move, but I won’t be the one in the family that lost the homestead.

These visions go away if you simply yell or throw a book at them. They seem to be getting worse as Christmas draws near.

…

I sit at the dining room table, dozing off as I listen to see if they’ll visit tonight. 

I open my eyes to a lit room. I fear I may have slept till morning but quickly realize the light is coming from a candle on the table.

Through the candlelight I can start to make out multiple apparitions. I stand quickly realizing I was sitting right inside one of them. 

“Get out of my house!” I yell, my anger genuine from the lack of sleep.  

Several of them flinch, but they don’t vanish. They are fuzzy, but they appear to be praying. 

The one at the head of the table appears to come in more clearly. 

“Mr. Clark can you hear me?” It startles me as they’ve never spoke before. 

“Get out of my house! Leave us alone!” I scream into her ear. Her head finches, but she doesn’t vanish.

“Mr. Clark what is your reason for being here?” She asks. 

“I live here! This is my house! Get out of my house! Leave my family alone!” I scream, throwing a book across the room.

“Mr. Clark why did you murder your family on Christmas of 1931?” she asks. 

I need a more powerful statement... An idea pops into my head.

I scream “Get out of my house or I’ll kill you all!” taking a mouthful of lamp oil I spit it into the candles causing a burst in the flames.

She had been clever, referring to tomorrow in the past tense, trying to spook me. That fireball was too much for them, they’re gone for good now.

I ponder “If ghosts are real, there’s an afterlife. Maybe they had a good idea, killing all of us, I’m sure we can get some damn sleep as ghosts.”

I start the plan a gift for my family; a way out of this hell, this great depression.",shortscarystories
"Vampires are solitary by nature, and seldom converse, preferring to compile; in ink or blood they'll write.


Vampires will never ever enter your home unless invited. They aren't bound by some magical barrier, they're just unerringly polite.


Vampires are meticulous, precise and ever organised. They feel a need to record, for reference. They'll tally every catch.


If a fistful of dry rice is thrown on the ground, a vampire will stop to count every grain. If distracted, they'll start again from scratch.


Vampires love of symmetry, akin to O.C.D., fuels a burning itch to couple words, to double words, to rhyme.


It's true that vampires shun the sunlight, though this is because they detest the chaos of crowds. their skin won't singe in daytime.


The vampire, like the puppy, likes to test the strength of its teeth by gnawing, and it's claws by clawing. It is like the puppy in no other way.


A vampire cannot cross running water, unless there is a bridge. That is as close to a joke as a vampire will stray.


Look not for cliche when ascertaining the vampire. They'd never blend into the modern city in dinner-suit or cape.


Vampires adore any lore about their kind. It doesn't matter if it's accurate; all the better if it's fake.",shortscarystories
"Something so small, the average person may not even realize it. Just one day when you're in the shower, using your usual loofah, but it just feels different, you can't explain it, but it feels... off.   
No sweat, probably all in your head. Right?  
Right.

Small things go missing, you could swear to God you just bought milk, how is the carton completely gone? You live alone.. There's no way anyone was in here and stole it. Right?  
Right. 

Another day you're driving home.. That road has never been there off of this main road. You swear you're not crazy, but how are there so many houses with cars in the driveway? How are these houses all lived in and maintained? This road has not once been here in the last 6 years you've taken this route. Maybe you're so used to the mundane tasks, you zone out while driving and you've just never noticed it. That has to be it. Right? Right.  
Right?

Things start making less and less sense. You swear on anything these tiny changes are occurring, but it seems like no one else can see them. The changes you mention to your friends only leave you with concerned glances and hushed words they're sure to cut off before you walk into a room. No one seems to believe you, maybe this is all in your head? Right? Right.. But you just cannot accept that. This isn't in your head and it's not your fault no one else can see it. 

Small things turn to big things. You know you didn't drive that Honda out front, however, your chariot awaits. Your dark brown hair is now a brassy blonde. Brown eyes don't change, but there they are staring at you, a speckled green. Why is it that no one else can see this? Why does everyone make you feel like you're crazy? Telling people about these changes has become even more terrifying than the changes themselves.

The looks in doctors eyes mirror the concern your friends hold, yet they show something else. Is that fear? You cannot keep this up anymore, you swallow their pills you beg for relief. Please make it stop. This will have to work, right?

Eventually, it's maybe worth admitting you are crazy. Staying in a hospital in a plain white room with no mirrors provides stability. Perhaps your friends and the doctors were right... Right?

But hey, did you hear that new girl who was brought in, crying her eyes out, that everything in her life has also begun to change?",shortscarystories
"I lead a boring life. I work all week, but don’t even earn enough to enjoy a night out. I suffer from OCD and it’s amplified by stress. I try to relax myself by reading, watching tv or listening to music. But my mind always seems to drift and the hounding thoughts trigger an OCD episode. After a tough day of work I sometimes clean my already spotless apartment from top to bottom. I clean throughout the night and don’t even make time for sleep before work. 

I know living like this isn’t healthy, so I decided to try something new to distract my mind and put me at ease. I was going to start listening to scary stories on YouTube. The mystery and suspense are perfect for maintaining my concentration and allowing my mind an escape from the stresses of the day. 

My new tactic was seemingly a huge success. A few days in with no impulses to clean, no thoughts of despair, nothing but stories and sleep. The tone of the narrator put me at ease, the stories were mysterious enough to keep me guessing, scary enough to keep me interested and at the conclusion I always felt calm enough to drift off to bed. It was still a boring life, but a peaceful life and for the first time in awhile I was content. 

I arrived home from work, ate dinner, showered and slid my earbuds in for my daily dose. I began listening to the voice of the narrator, but tonight I wasn’t getting the same feeling I have the previous nights. I was feeling a sense of unease. I tried concentrating on the soothing voice, tried comprehending the story being laid out in front of me, but my mind was beginning to race.

I felt physically cold and I began letting the OCD tendencies creep in. I thought of how I hadn’t cleaned the house in days, how I hadn’t changed the sheets or taken out the garbage. Now it was ringing in my head on repeat, I gave into my impulses. I had to get new sheets out of the dryer. I had to take the garbage out. I had to close the window. I had to water the plants.

Suddenly my mind stopped racing and only one thought went through my mind: I never opened the window.",shortscarystories
"I don't often remember my dreams. Sometimes they're scary, sometimes they're peaceful. But, I rarely remember them.

Do you ever get paranoid? Just out of nowhere? Like you're alone and suddenly your neck prickles and you look around startled? That's how I feel when I remember a dream, especially a scary one. I don't really know why. Maybe it's because it doesn't happen often.

I've actually gone to therapists about it. It just doesn't seem natural to me. Here I go being paranoid about paranoia.

I found a hole in a dream once. I didn't know what to make of it. Usually I can control my dreams. Make things appear and disappear. But I couldn't do anything to the hole. It just sat there embedded in the wall of my dream-mansion. It had no color, if that makes any sense. Just sat there, waiting I guess. 

So I conjured up a rock and threw it into the hole. Nothing happened. A doll. Nothing. A hat. Nothing. A mouse. Screaming. 

I woke up in a cold sweat.

It’s been a few years since that dream. I still think about it. Sometimes I try to create a hole like that one. But it never works.

Once I told a friend of mine about the dream. She said she didn’t need to dream to find A-holes. We had a laugh about it.

A week later, I saw a girl with a doll that looked exactly like the one I threw into the hole. The doll itself was completely original and native to only my mind.

A week after that I saw a boy with an action figure from my childhood. It was pristine for something that hadn’t been in production for 10 years.      

 The next day I saw a pale man in a trench coat and fedora whose eyes shined and teeth were sharp. It took me a moment to recognize him from a nightmare I had when I was twelve. 

I see my therapist a lot more nowadays. 

I don't often remember my dreams. Sometimes they're scary, sometimes they're peaceful. But, I rarely remember them.

How many times have I dreamed of that hole?",shortscarystories
"Greg groans and rolls over. He sees the flashes of bright color through his closed eyelids; first red, now green, now purple. The music is so loud he wants to plug his ears. His head is pounding, but he feels someone shaking his shoulders so he slowly opens his eyes. 

A man no older than 24 despite the scraggly, unkempt beard is looking at him worriedly. 

""Shit, man, you had us worried for a sec,"" he says. 

Greg sits up and looks around. The room is full of people; a few guys are holding beers, theres a few people fucking with wild abandon in the corner, others are passing around a joint, some are puking up their guts. 

""I'm at a party?"" Greg asks. ""How'd I get here?"" He puts a hand to his pounding head. Shit. He couldn't remember, but that's always a sign of a good party. 

The bearded man helps him to his feet. ""Nobody really knows how we get here, but none of us are complaining. You see, this party never ends, bro."" 

He extends his hand to Greg. The nails are long and crusted in dirt. ""My names Josh. I've been here the longest. 6 years and counting!"" He nods to a corner of the room where a few others are huddled. They all look haggard and unkempt,  like they dont belong. ""Henry's been here 3 years, Ted's been here for 2 and half. And now there's you!"" Josh hesitates for a second. ""And everyone else,"" he adds.

Josh pauses as a beer bottles sails by Greg's head and smashes into the wall. As Greg turns to see who threw it, a girl walks by and pulls him towards her face, lips parted. Surprised but definitely not complaining, Greg leans in. Then she starts to fade away. Bewildered, Greg looks around. The music stopped. The lights have disappeared. The broken beer bottle is no longer there. The walls now look brown and worn and are covered in feces and urine. There's nobody in the small room except Josh, Henry, and Ted, who stand huddled underneath a small panel in the ceiling. 

""What the actual FUCK!?"" Greg exclaims. He walks towards Josh, who's watching the panel intently. ""Wanna tell me what's going on here?""

Then he pauses at a sound from the ceiling. The small panel opens up and a multitude of small plastic bags fall through. Greg watches as the three men pounce on the small packets, tearing them open and devouring them. 

Josh tosses one of the little bags to Greg. Greg looks down at the white powder and assortment of pills within it. He looks at the others, disheveled and dirty, then back at the pouch. 

He understands. 

Greg rips open the bag and downs the contents. The music and lights slowly return. The girl materializes in his arms. He feels calm and relaxed.

Josh looks at him again. ""Welcome to the party that never ends,"" he says.",shortscarystories
"They had to specially design sunglasses for her as she was now super sensitive to the light and her eyes watered constantly and were prone to irritation. After the news stories and the GoFundMe’s, there was no shortage of people willing to help out, to come up with special accommodations for this sudden and terrible deformity. 

What happened was my friend and I were getting ready to go out and meet up with some friends. We were procrastinating and messing around at her apartment, smoking a bowl and having a couple glasses of wine. She opened up the SnapChat app and headed off to the kitchen to refill her wine.  

""Hey! Take a selfie with me! It's for Greg.""

""Nah, I'm good,"" I said from the couch. It’s not that I minded doing it for her, but I was relaxed and didn’t want to get up. I've never been more thankful for my own laziness in my life. 

From the kitchen, I heard a scream intermingled with an awful crunching noise.

“Elise? What is it?” I asked, getting up from the couch. 

She came around the corner, a look of horror on her face. What I saw knocked the wind out of me.

Her eyes were...giant. The whites of them the size of saucers, every blood vessel prominent and huge. They invaded the territory of her forehead and her eyelashes were long tendrils that flopped around involuntarily. She looked like some CGI Disney princess come to life, eyes all stylized and unrealistic, but very real as she stood before me. 

No one could come up with a plausible explanation that didn't involve black magic or the supernatural. It was a medical and scientific mystery. For others, it was simply proof that we were living in a simulation. Us, the subjects of the simulation had somehow created software that could alter the matrix's code in real time, resulting in the monstrosities we now witnessed. 

The app's stock plummeted and they removed all filter options from their programming, their most popular feature. In Washington they worked diligently to shut down the app completely. 

But not before there were other victims: the kid with a gaping red lipped mouth where his face used to be, teeth the size of credit cards. Or the Instagram influencer who had developed the soft brown nose of a deer and bony antlers jutting from her forehead. She was more fortunate and made a few videos for the furry crowd before having surgical correction. Then there was the girl who vomited a torrent of bright rainbow colors everytime she opened her mouth.They had wired her jaw shut for the time being and were coming up with a solution that involved abdominal surgery and a feeding tube. 

My friend’s eyes hurt constantly and she has to use special drops for lubrication. They say she may go blind. Snapchat was retooled and the CEO was eventually fired. He walked away with a 35.7 million severance package.",shortscarystories
"I awaken groggily at first, until my mind processes what exactly stirred me back to consciousness. There is no mistaking it, the sound or its disconcerting location. My heartbeat spikes and my mind races. Every muscle tenses and freezes. A million potential horrors flicker through my mind.

It’s just my husband, my brain reassures, and I begin to relax. His snoring has gotten worse and worse as the years have passed. On bad nights, he’s been known to even wake himself up with it, never mind my own oft troubled sleep. 

And the acoustics of this room have always been strange, I reason, and my heart finally slows. Our new house is far bigger than the old, and we don’t have furniture enough to fill it yet. A Chief’s salary will pay the mortgage, but not much else, it seems. Sound echoes and fills the empty spaces in ways it shouldn’t, taunting me with possibility of what might be lurking. 

I roll over to rub his back, which tends to ease the snoring and guide him back to a deeper slumber. I laugh to myself as I imagine the smile he’ll crack at my wild imagination when I tell him this story over breakfast. 

My hand pats the empty bed, first with soft confusion and then with a more frantic, desperate search. A thread of icy remembrance slips down my spine. My husband left for deployment this morning, the first since we moved to this new house. 

My corner isn’t snoring now. Not now that it knows I’m awake.",shortscarystories
"It was supposed to be a nice leisurely ride through the mountains. My mother casually mentioned a bill she needed to pay and her boyfriend started a full blown argument. Eventually he pulled over and they continued yelling.

I stared out the window, trying to ignore them. That's when I saw the other truck. The driver and passenger looked terrified. They tried to stop but the truck was going to fast.

They slammed into us, crushing the front passenger door and sending glass everywhere. I heard the sickening crack of the door hitting my mother's head.

We rolled down the mountain, glass shattering everywhere around us. My mother and her boyfriend were thrown out the front window, they never wore seatbelts. A rock hit my glasses and shattered them, sending plastic into my eyes. I screamed in sheer pain, my ears pounding from the sound of metal tearing around me.

I remember hearing a loud bang and feeling the truck stop. I remember feeling blood roll down my cheeks from my eyes. I remember the pain I felt. I remember passing out.

I woke up hearing beeping all around me. The room was pitch black. I weakly moved my hand around until I hit the end table. I somehow found a lamp and pulled the chain. It did nothing.

Someone came in and approached me slowly. I felt my heart skip a beat as I turned to face them, but I saw nothing. The person sat on my bed and sighed.

""I'm Dr. Hinson, and I'm afraid I have some bad news about your eyesight."" He didn't have to say another word. I already knew.

"“176 Lamborne Crescent”
That’s the address Mike sent me,  but I think its wrong. I probably should have double checked before leaving, cause now I’m in front of an old run down building. Looks like no one’s been in there for years, maybe decades. I guess it is a Halloween party, so maybe it’s kind of like a haunted house ? I don’t really care honestly and I’m kind of up for a scare anyway. One last time before making my way towards the door, I double checked the address. This has to be it. I put my hand on the door knob, weirdly enough it had a thick layer of dust on it. If anyone else had gone
in, wouldn’t it be gone ? Maybe there’s another entrance I don’t know about. I walked in, the floor was really creaky and it was super dark. Using my phone flashlight, I made my way up a staircase.

"
I’ve always been terrified of whales. As a kid I panicked at the concept of a creature so large. I felt helplessly small with the knowledge that they existed, roaming their vast oceans with complete indifference of my fear. Giants without capacity to comprehend an ant’s existential terror. Perhaps I was more sensitive to the discovery than others. 

Earthquakes, Tsunamis. This thing was our explanation. The news came in of the discovery of a creature so large it disrupted huge volumes of water any way that it twitched. An island, they compared it to. The reason for it’s late discovery, despite the obvious signs: It’s size was too huge for biologist to comprehend that it was alive. 

Besides a few, highly controlled media releases, its location and specific measurements were undisclosed to the general public, “conservational reasons they called it. 

Awe and amazement followed as a decent level of interest and fascination gripped the world. But that was it. 5 years later and this monument of a creature is regarded as a simple statue, so unmoving and comforting, cemented as a harmless, ever asleep, living island in our cultures. No one is afraid. Brought up in casual interest rather than panic. 

And I’m going fucking crazy. 

This thing isn’t the size of an island. Leaks from the Russian government mentioned its AT LEAST the side of Africa. The fucking. Continent. I don’t think you can understand. El Capitan, Kinabalu, these mountains weighted in our minds, are close to our limits in scaling crazy size. Thing thing is so massive it’s incomprehensible, no one can talk about it without sort of shorting out. Is it just me that’s freaking out that this thing exists? I hear a constant bass ringing in my ears, I feel a rumble in my heart while my brain goes numb. Every one of my waking hours is disturbed by the existence of the thing. The thing I most fear is not the potential monster, it’s the complete indifference it will have in wiping us out by simply standing up. 

Six months ago, a muscle spasm sent tidal waves to the entire coast of California with millions supposedly dead. Audible and “unexplainable” earthquakes shook Russia for a consistent 3 months. New Zealand is damn near submerged with unpredictable tide rises, and there are rumors that China has begun to evacuate their entire eastern shore further inland to higher ground. 

Yet still? 

“Natural Disasters” 

Jesus Christ. 

We need to wake up about what’s happening. The general public struggles with an existential like terror that forces the concept deep into their unconscious mind. This thing just twitches and millions drown. If it wakes up what do you we can do? As impressive and peaceful as whales are we eventually hunted them for sport with our learned advancements. We can’t hope to dent this creatures awareness toward our entire species, harming it? We might as well chisel the ground we live on in hopes of killing dirt.

Spread the word I beg of you. And if any of you work in higher governments or something please acknowledge the monumental size of this thing. I feel so alone in my paralyzed terror. 

If any of you have ideas that, I don’t know, might even suggest the possibility of our survival. Say something, just start talking please.",shortscarystories
"Two days after Christmas, and no great stir was through the house. The done to death holiday tales were coming to an end, thankfully. I waited for the tales of killer snowmen and invaders who weren't Santa Clause to fade away from the Internets craving eye. Everyone was at work or gone home, and it was just me and my computer. Which is why I want to regale the web with yet another holiday tale.

I have a neighbor, a strange old cross eyed man who we all call Mr. Halloween. He's harmless, I think. The neighborhood I live in despite being in a rough town, is very peaceful. Only once has a house been robbed here, and when the perpetrators were caught they were found in their cells completely burned to death. Strange noises emanated from Mr. Halloweens house the night it happened. I don't know how he got his nickname, Mr. Halloween. Maybe its because he's a spooky guy, but no one knows his real name. My parents don't talk about him, kids stay away from his house. I often chance a hello in the mornings, and he'll just look at me with his emerald green eyes and grunt. That's okay though, because I'm neighborly and someone interacts with the old man, everyone wins.

What's strange to me, is that on Christmas night, every year there's always a great commotion about his house. Generally I just ignore it, but this year I chanced a look through my curtains. All I saw through his window was him dressed his Sunday best in the living room of his house, talking to someone. The next night, as I was up at 3 A.M. Someone tried to break in. I saw them trying to pry the door, and then I saw a pentagram light up in Mr. Halloween's living room. There was a blood curdling scream and the would be burglar went up in flames.

I think Mr. Halloween knows that I saw what happened. I also think he knows that I'm quite grateful. I don't mind it, and nobody knows. So whats wrong with your friendly neighborhood satanist?",shortscarystories
"00:02- Unknown alien device, believed analogous to a human spaceship, enters earth orbit. I am sent to investigate it.

&amp;#x200B;

LOG BEGINS

02:12- I enter the alien spaceship. Despite the semi-biological external appearance, internally the ship resembles white, pristine rooms. I encounter no resistance as I walk forwards

02:18- I encounter the inhabitants of the ship. They strongly resemble reports of “Greys”- big heads, small bodies. Maybe the UFO nuts were onto something? Heh.

02:25- I’m eating a meal with the aliens. Apparently due to an evolutionary coincidence, our biochemistry is compatible. We have a conversation. They ask me a lot about the earth, and I ask a lot about their home planet. Transcript linked. I ask to go home.

02:26- apparently the shuttle that took me here had a “technical malfunction” and I’m stuck here for a few hours. Their ships need to cool down after a FTL jump. They have a room for me to stay in while I wait.

02:30- I think something’s wrong here.

03:10- I’ve been investigating the ship. It’s empty. Other then the rooms I’m in, nothing. No aliens, no furniture, no machines. Just the white rooms. I keep looking around.

03:40- the aliens found me. They said that their technology was nanobotic, in “smart foam” until needed. I should go to my room, for fear of disrupting the system. Something still seems wrong.

04:00- I’m going to sleep. I guess this is just nerves. First contact and all. They seem friendly enough after all. Hopefully I’ll be back on earth tomorrow.

07:00- Fuck

07:00- How did I not notice?

07:00- *How are they speaking English?*

07:45- I asked them, and they told me. They showed me the video, of the incomprehensible things tearing my brain out and uploading into their biotech machines. And playing the simulation. They smile. They say they’re pretty close to human now. I think they expect me to be proud of them.

07:50- I put my gun to my head. It doesn’t fire.

07:55- This is simulation 4832. 5 minutes have passed in the real world.

08:00- I try to drown myself in the bathtub, in my room. I can breath normally, even with my full body under

08:10- they showed me the memories. The first few simulations, of incomprehensible images and sounds. The experiment simulations, of physical and mental torture to see how humans worked. And the diplomacy simulations. Like this one. They’re still smiling

08:20- I beg to be let out. I don’t think they grasp the concept.

08:30- I try to jump from the ship- I end up back on it. They grab me. I beg. I’d rather die then be in this loop. They shake their head. “You say that every time. A misunderstanding. When we know you well enough, you will understand. Reset”.

"The road was dark and suspiciously silent as I walked towards Hamilton Hall. It had been five weeks since my parents’ deaths in a car accident off the coast. The medical school offered to let me take a leave of absence, but I only asked for four weeks. I couldn’t stomach leaving school for an entire year––I pictured myself spiraling into insanity like Jack Torrance in my now empty house. The funeral didn’t take much time to plan anyway without bodies to prepare.  

Now at the lab, I opened the door and flipped on the lights. Before me, the fluorescent light reflected off twenty identical metal containers that contained the muscles I needed to memorize. I was walking to get gloves when I first heard the sound. There were voices coming from the other side of the room and something was familiar about them.

The sound appeared to be coming from the last container on the right. As I stood over the gleaming metal, I could make out a muffled conversation. I pressed my ear against the top, and the realization shook me. It was my parents, but how? They were in a car, just talking. Then the screaming started. I heard yells, screeching, and loud crash. In a fury, I grabbed both handles and yanked the container open. The weight of the contents threw my body backwards. I opened my eyes and let out a guttural yell. It was…my parents. My dad’s lifeless face stared down at mine, oozing fluid. I recognized my mom’s hands, her nails still painted red. Then, the lights went out. 

I pushed the bodies off and struggled to see. *Clank!* I jumped at the sound. *Clank!* I crawled towards the wall and started towards the other side. *Clank!* “David, don’t you want to know?” I inched along as quietly as I could. “Don’t you want to know how your parents looked before they died?” I knew there was a bone saw hanging on that wall, and it was my only chance. My index finger touched the edge of the metal, then I felt warm breath on my face. “Hello David.” My hand closed around the handle, and I swung it forward. It sunk into his skin, and he screamed. I tried to run, but I felt a searing pain in my left arm. I stumbled along the wall and darted for the door. I put pressure on my arm and groped for the handle, falling into the bright hallway.

I looked up and saw a man standing in the hall. I couldn’t make out who it was at first, but I recognized the insignia on his coat. “Dr. Williams! There’s someone in the lab!” I ran towards him, but something made me stop. An object was gleaming in his hands––an axe. “Nice to see you David, how are your parents?” Behind me, the door crashed open. With hands covered in blood, I clenched my fist around the saw and ran towards him.",shortscarystories

“Jimmy?”

Jimmy shirtless, sitting by the fire turned to look at Bill. Jimmy stood and turned to approach Bill, the firelight glinting from the blade of the knife in his hand.

“Jimmy, you doin okay man? What’s going on?” Bill could now see a large cross that Jimmy had carved in his own chest. He kicked himself for thinking a wilderness camping trip would help distract Jimmy from his wife’s death.

“Jesus Jimmy! What did you do?”

Jimmy squatted, studying Bill, occasionally looking to the sky, it was almost completely dark now.

“I’m just workin on a theory.” Jimmy said with tears in his eyes. “I just want to make sure you’re given the chance to make amends in case I have to do what I’m thinkin I might.”

“Jimmy, you’re freaking me out... What is it that you think you might have to do? Did you take your medication? You’re not lookin so hot…”

Jimmy looked at his watch then to the sky. He pulled a flask from his pocket and took a long pull. “I’ve got my medicine right here…” removing a large revolver from his waistband “Like I said… I’m workin on a theory.”

Bill increased his covert efforts to escape the chains. “Jimmy what’s the gun for? What do you think you might have to do?”

“Yeah… I remember… That’s why this is so hard…” Jimmy trying again to regain his voice through the emotions. “You’re the only one I can’t account for that night… Only one theory makes sense.”

“Is that what this was about? You think I tore her apart like that? She was like my sister!” Bill was now pulling against the chains, trying to stand or loosen them.

Jimmy removed a single bullet from the cylinder. “Nine bucks a shot… Normally” He looked at the bullet studying it, his appearance pale and sweaty. “Made this one from her necklace… pure silver…” looking to the sky “Moon should be up soon”

“Jimmy… where’s your meds? Jesus, let me go, I can get em for you… Are you sayn you think I’m a werewolf?”

Jimmy stood, taking another swig from the flask, sweating profusely now. “You better get right with Jesus; cause I’m sending you to meet him…” cocking the hammer as he points the gun at Bill’s heart.

“Jimmy! Jesus… Let me get your meds!” Bill struggled against the bindings. “Jimmy, listen if I’m going to change doesn’t the moonlight have to hit me?”

Jimmy was now ghostly white, scratching his skin on his chest, a wild look in his eyes.

“Please Jimmy…”

“Jimmy! Get your heart meds!”

Bill frantically tried to get free, but Jimmy’s corpse now lay just out of reach.",shortscarystories

“He was always quiet, so even saying I “knew” him as a child would be a lie really. I don’t think any of us really “knew” him in that way, he was just an acquaintance even at that age. I think that’s pretty normal though, for kids to want to keep to themselves nowadays. I think people just left him alone, which appeared to suit him fine.”

“I think he picked up his interest in magic early on. I mean, it was difficult to know, but with the obvious talent he had I always presumed he must have started early.

“He did gradually grow more distant. It was not something I immediately noticed, more of a hindsight thing. I wasn’t really sure what to make of it when I did realise it. It seemed a bizarre notion that he might be seeing someone else, but as soon as an idea latches on it has a habit of sticking around. I mean, I guess we all know now probably what that was all about. A part of me does still hope that it’s all some illusion somehow. I mean, people have died, it can’t be. But what else can I think, how am I supposed to retain some shred of sanity otherwise?”

"The scraping was getting louder. The sounds of claws frantically tearing against the trapdoor to the attic, eager to dig into his soft flesh. The scent of death rising steadily along with the shrieks of the beasts below looking for their next meal. Or maybe they just wanted the rush of the kill. The sweet feeling of something so powerless struggling to escape certain death by a formidable adversary. The metallic copper scent of the blood that they were covered in filling what was left of the ruined cabin, adding one more mangled body to the pile.

The boy didn’t know what to do. Streaks of salty tears ran down his face, cutting lines through the dirt and soot accumulated on his face. He knew this was it. He couldn’t have been more than 12 or 13 and he knew that this was his last day on this wretched earth. The attic was dark and uninviting with cobwebs littered around and broken tools scattered across the floor, accented by the faint glint of broken glass reflecting the moonlight through the tattered roof. A few meters forward, the ever so ominous shadow of what appears to be a broken loom, undoubtedly as ancient as the attic itself lurks in the distance.

The claws.

Unbearable. Like a mix between a screeching whiteboard and that of a dog pawing a door, trying to get inside to the warmth and safety of a home. He could hear the splinters of wood falling off the trapdoor into the mouths of the godforsaken creatures below. God? Is there a God? Surely if there was, He wouldn’t have created such monstrosities as this, would he? Perhaps this is it. A final act to close the curtains on the play of humanity once and for all. A way to finally make humans atone for their sins, past and present… or maybe it's just shit luck.

The loom shifts and rises from its inert state. A pair of glowing yellow eyes pierce the darkness accompanied by a flash of pure white teeth in a crooked smile.

I walk over to the trapdoor. The boy is paralyzed in fear. A small click and the latch is undone, and I slip out as the scent of death slips in. A single gnarled hand, accented by five wicked claws reaches up, ascending into the attic with a sudden calmness. Almost like it knew the kill was mere moments away.

I gave a small laugh and whispered: ""Go.""

There was no scream.

The attic trapdoor now hangs open. Empty.",shortscarystories
"I wished that I didn't have to give birth again. It was so painful the last time.

Next night, my husband complained of a pain in his stomach. I thought it was nothing, just a little stomach ache, and he took some Pepto-Bismol to help the pain. It didn't help, but he said he'd live with it.

The day after, I went to the doctor's for a yearly checkup, as always. The doctor said I had gained quite a bit of weight since last year. I was confused, but said I'd get on a diet to lose it. I remember how long it took me to lose the weight last time I was pregnant.

The pain only got worse for my husband. His stomach was growing fast, like he was pregnant. We brought him to the doctor finally, after 2 or so weeks after the pain had started. The pain hadn't been there the whole time, just about 6-8 hours a day.

The doctor said he'd get back to us, and we left, my husband still in near-constant pain.

I never thought wishes came true.

A week later, my husband died from the unbearable pain. Autopsy revealed a...somehow...growing embryo in his stomach. It seemed to grow inexplicably.

I never made wishes again.",shortscarystories
"“Daddy say’s I’m special…. Hehehe” Beth was right in Katrina’s face taunting, closer now, since the teacher had stepped out. 

Katrina looked at her desk, trying to calm her nerves. She must go deep inside and ignore the bullying. Her father warned her many times about losing her temper. 

“Daddy says I’m his Little Princess….” Beth and the girls continued taunting. 

They weren’t teasing her just because she had bright red hair, or that she had said those words in defense; they were trying to make “it” happen again. 

Katrina continued to focus, head down, studying the doodles on her notebook, trying to escape the rage building inside. Her skin was prickled, the hair on her arms standing, quivering, even her desk seemed to be vibrating mimicking her nerves.

Once before, she had lost her temper, causing her hair to raise like static electricity when pulling off a sweater. Beth and the girls continually tried to make “it” happen again. 

“Freak!” They called her, gathering around her laughing. No, she would remain calm.

&lt;Bam!&gt;

Katrina’s vision went black, blurry as she opened her eyes, sight impeded by the fast swelling of her eye socket, the sting ricocheting through her skull then body.

Disbelief… “She hit me… She actually hit me!” 

Rage... Her hair now rose, surpassing the previous frayed static movement, swirling, forming strands, writhing, now resembling the flames of a fire enraged by fuel. Her desk lifted, hovering several inches from the floor vibrating.

As she raised her head, everything in the classroom, every desk, every student except for Beth slammed to the walls, pinned mid-way to the ceiling. The energy causing the lights to spark and flicker, filling the room with the pungent smell of ozone.

Beth floated rigidly, as if being crucified, tears of terror streaming from her face.

Katrina couldn’t find the language for what she was feeling as she approached Beth, it was far more intense than rage, any word attempting to describe it would be left wanting.

She looked directly into Beth’s eyes as her hair continued to flow menacingly to the sides and above her head. 

“Daddy says “It’s my world and I get to choose who I name as the villain…”” inches now between their noses “I choose to bestow that honor upon my own name.”

She gripped Beth’s head with both hands, absorbing her soul, Beth’s shriveled ashen corpse falling limply to the floor.

Her father hoped she would choose to use her powers to defend humanity. In her rage, she recognized that the true evil resided within these cruel beings themselves.

Her hair now flowing, twisting and twirling on top of her head forming a flame-like crown. 

Yes, she had been Daddy’s little princess…. 

But she has now awakened to claim her throne.",shortscarystories
"I live in Manor Texas and it has been foggy for the past 3 days. We haven't gotten an alert saying there is something wrong. But there is something wrong. There is something in the fog. I hear it and I've seen it. It is in the fog and it kills people. I've had a close encounter with it, I walked out my house to grab something behind my neighbors and I saw a figure I saw it, I just cant explain what it looks like. There have been more deaths in my neighborhood its scaring me I dont know what to do, and I think it's coming for me. I dont know why but it is. I just hear it we all hear it. The ear perircing screech of its roars, and the low growls that feels like an earthquake. The noices scare all of us at night and day, the pounding of its feet while walking through out the woods feels like an earthquake just like its growl. Some people who have seen it say it speaks but it didnt to me, but I know I  just know it. The creature walks through out Manor and Austin but mostly stays near me. Sometimes when it is near my house I hear a voice like those people said. But its incoherent, the voice isnt in a foreign language to me it seems to speak in English. But I dont know what is going on but I'm scared and we all are. I have one theory on what it is, I think it's a government experiment that got out and they haven't warned us so someone could get it and we won't know. The more it passes the more I can understand the words its saying. I can now understand what its saying ""they are coming"" but that's all I can understand. The creature stays by my house, I an now starting to think that it's not coming for me but they're coming for it. I just had a strong feeling that the creature wants me.

"Today was the first day of class. 

Everyone was pretty loud and excited after coming back from break, so it was hard to notice the awkward movements and twitching coming from the substitute teacher.

Anyway, I was busy scribbling in my notebook when the sub passed out the assigned numbers for each student. This was somewhat standard for school but I was surprised at how quickly the class got quiet. I looked down at my number and saw a glistening 13.

This made me more curious and I started to gaze around the class to see what everyone else got. My desk partner had sixty-eight. The girl to my left had three hundred sixty-six. And further down a boy had one thousand. This was especially confusing since we only had 25 students in attendance. What was even eerier was those with a negative slashed behind theirs. 

The atmosphere felt increasingly tense and I felt a heavy weight in my stomach. Usually, we would be laughing and poking fun at the absurdness of these assigned numbers, but even the class clown held his tongue. As I looked at everyone's numbers I began to realize that everyone was looking in the same direction. I followed their stares back to the sub. He was slouching back awkwardly against his chair. He didn't even hold his own head up so he looked more like a life-size puppet than a human. Or like a ragdoll with no soul. His eyes looked so dark I could have sworn they weren't even there. 

I couldn't stand to look at him anymore. I pulled down my wool cap as my far as I could and stared straight down at my desk. On one hand, I chewed my fingernail and on the other, I shakily wrote broken cursive, quickly and quietly in my notebook. Around me, I could hear screams and the unnatural sounds of bones crunching and twisting. I wrote faster trying to drown out the sounds. I splintered my pencil but kept writing. I felt myself shrinking further into my seat. My nail was chewed bloody. 

Then, silence.

Looking down, I led myself out of the classroom. I ignored all the wrinkled and skeleton-like things I saw piled all around the room in the corner of my eye. Some of them were incredibly small. Even when I was out of school and could feel the sun on face, I didn't look up. I felt my way home and went directly to my room. It was then that I noticed it. I collapsed in shock at what I saw in my reflection. I was a few inches shorter, my skin was fair and smooth, and my arms were very slender. I was no longer 17 years old.",shortscarystories
"I stand in front of the bathroom mirror, staring at my reflection. 

I look sad. No, I *am* sad. 

I turn my head to the left and examine a handprint across my face. It is bright red, and I wince when I lightly touch it. 

I lift up my shirt and examine my shoulder. It has a mark on it most likely gotten from a strong pinch. 

Then I pull down my pants and examined my buttocks. I see large imprints, as if from a large tool. I, like my face, wince when I touch them. 

Tears start to run down my face. I feel faint, so I grabb onto the sink, fearing the worst. 

What did I do to deserve all this?

While she hurts me, my mother says “it’s out of love.” My father can’t really say anything logical because he’s usually home drunk. 

So, I must deserve all this, right?

Right?

I wipe away my tears, look at myself in the mirror again, and sigh deeply.

“Just a couple more years, and then you’ll be out of this house and away from them.”

Suddenly, I hear shouts from upstairs. “No!” screams my 9 year old brother. “Come here!” my mother screams back. Then all is silent.

But the silence is short-lived. 

I hear multiple whacks, the familiar sound of a cooking spoon on my brother’s buttocks. Each whack is accompanied by a blood-curdling “ow”. Each “ow” makes my heart drop and my tears flow faster. Among these screams are my mother’s voice, shouting “You are in bed for a week! You’re an awful child!”

Suddenly, I hear my father open the front door and slam it forcefully. He’s drunk, I whisper. He screams my name, along with some expletives. “Get down here now!” he shouts. 

I look back in the mirror. My house has become a cacophony of dissonance. My little brother is screaming in pain, my other siblings are crying in fear, my mother is berating my brother, and my father is drunkenly shouting my name. 

My parents always say all this is my fault. They must be right, right?

"Ever since I was little, I have always closed the door to our guest room before going to bed. My younger sister used to have it as her room. The Room is across the hall from my room, and its nearly always empty. Except at night. 

 It happened a year ago. It was time for bed, so I brushed my teeth, changed into my pajamas, closed the Room’s door and got into bed. I read for a little while, then shut my bedside lamp off and snuggled under the covers, taking precautions to keep my feet and hands under the blanket. Everyone knows to keep your limbs inside the blanket. 

Although it was late at night and I had had a busy day, I just couldn’t bear to shut my eyes. I tossed and turned and tried to fall asleep, but it just wasn’t going to happen. I rolled over to face the doorway that had the hallway light flushing in.
 
Something felt wrong. The house was eerily quiet. Then I noticed it, the Room door was wide open. The black abyss appeared to be staring back at me. I was sure I had closed it! I knew I shouldn’t be afraid, but there was just something off about that room that just made me want to close it off from the rest of the house. And I was right. 

As I stared at the doorway, trying to convince myself nothing was wrong, a tiny, wrinkly, ash-gray arm slithered out of the darkness of the Room. I tried to close my eyes, but something told me I had to keep watching it. Its’ arm hung in midair, its gnarly hand limp. Then it started waving at me. I didn’t know what to do. The house had gone from an eerie silence to having a low buzzing sound. Kind of like when the electricity turns back on after the power being out. 

Then, the creature leaned forward. It face was something noone can accurately describe. It seemed to be twisted into a knot, with two gaping holes where the eyes should have been. Its mouth had a hundred sharp teeth that formed a gross, sinister grin. Its gnarled skin looked dry and cracked. Then, the hallway light went out. We were in pitch blackness. 

The house had gone back to a still silence, until I heard the soft sound of something crawling across the carpet. I slipped my head under the covers, and held my breath. I stayed as still as possible. I heard the creature breathing and smelled its rancid breath. Suddenly, the hallway light flicked back on. The light shone into my room and seemed to scare the creature. I listened to it quickly shuffle away from my bed and back into the Room. I didn’t dare move. I stayed up all night, petrified.

When the sun finally rose, I slowly got up and glanced into the Room. The Room was empty, with no sign of what had happened only a few hours ago. Maybe I dreamt it, but to this day I still double-check that I shut that door, for who knows what will happen next time it’s open.",shortscarystories

"I watched her as she took a seat on the train. It was late at night and we were alone together in the car. She sat silently, not on her phone, not reading, staring blankly. She looked so forlorn, sitting there alone. There was an unusual sense of familiarity in her presence. I couldn’t place it. 

The lights of the train car flashed out as we shot through the tunnel, and she disappeared before my eyes. For those brief seconds she had gone completely. I held my breath- something was wrong. The light returned and so did she, staring directly at me. Her eyes were red, she was tired, but there was something insidious lurking behind them. I tried to look away but I couldn’t, she was so beautiful, so powerful. She looked as though she needed to tell me something, to warn me. 

I knew something had changed in that moment. The place in which the two of us existed was not reality, time had ceased. We were locked in this gaze that had caused it to stop. I wasn’t breathing, but I was fine. She wouldn’t let anything bad happen to me. The train shook as we barreled down the tracks, moving according to its schedule although time was no longer progressing. She held me captive in her scrutiny, her eyes like shackles that bound me to this endless moment. I found myself standing at this point. The train was shaking violently now, but I had to get closer. I needed to put an end to this. I walked towards her slowly, carefully, silently. I wanted to touch her. I needed to touch her. She held my gaze as I approached her. I reached out my hand, she reciprocated. When our hands met, I felt nothing but cold glass. 

I collapsed. It was done.",shortscarystories

""Hello?? You start the car and follow my directions... *now.*""

""Sorry, but I have to go home. My dog needs to be let out... plus I have ice cream.""

""Are you serious???"" He sounded upset, I wonder why? ""I have a *gun* you have to do what I tell you!!"" 

""No, I don't. My doctor told me not to talk to you anymore.""

I turned the car on and played the radio. 

""What is wrong with you!! Do what I tell you to!!"" 

I turned the radio up and started to sing along. I began my drive home. What should I have for dinner? 

I heard a loud noise and a sharp pinch in my side. Wow it's been a while since one of them hurt me. 

""You're crazy!!"" He shouted leaving me alone in the car. 

I pressed my hand against my hip. Is this real I wonder. It felt real... but it always felt real. 

I pulled over and turned my car off. Suddenly someone knocked on the door. How polite! I opened the door and smiled about to ask what was wrong when I felt the pain worsen.

""Ma'am!! You've been shot, it's going to be ok I called an ambulance!!""

"So about two years ago I started having these awful nightmares. They would almost always occur in a dark or almost dark area. In my nightmares I saw shadow people. They're tall and completely black but for some reason they're eyes are darker than their skin. They have no other physical features and wear no clothes. They have hands like humans and a smile that could make a marine run for his momma. The first one I ever had shook me to my core and I woke up screaming and crying. This nightmare took place at my old house and me and my little brother were walking home from school. Okay so let me tell you a little bit about the walk home from my school to my old house. You and to walk down this steep hill and then turn and my house was the fifth one from that turn. Being the little bitch that I am I decided to run and leave my brother behind and when I got to the porch I turned around to wait for him but I saw something. A shadow person staring at me and waving with an awful smile on it's face. As soon as my brother rounded the corner it grabbed him by the back of his head and dragged his face on the ground until it reached me. It laughed and I woke up. I ran to my brothers room to check on him and he was fine. I thought it was a one time thing but it started happening every night. These shadow people started whispering awful things to me, then they started talking. They they started forcing me to choose - kill myself or watch my loved ones be killed. Then my loved ones started seeing the shadow people in these nightmares. They got worse and worse every day then I started seeing them at night. It started off as just barely being able to make out their shape but now I can see them clearly every night. I don't just see one or two of them, I see them everywhere. I see them hanging by their necks and I see them standing on the sides of the roads. I see them peering through the woods at me and I don't know what to do. What do you thinks happening to me?

"When I was in college, money was tight.

One day while in class, I mentioned my situation to a friend and he suggested I donate blood. Adding that the pay was good and handed me a card to the local Blood Bank.

When I called the Blood Bank an older woman answered and gave me directions to the place.

I arrived an hour later and was hesitant at first but the thought of money in my pockets convinced me otherwise. 

As I entered the building though, I could hear screams coming from the back. As I nervously glanced over at the receptionist she said nonchalantly, ""some people get nervous when they see needles.""

After I checked in, I sat down and noticed several other people in the waiting room who all appeared to be homeless. 

Easy money for them too, I thought.

Twenty minutes later they called my name but I was too scared to go in because I had a fear of needles.  

As the nurse walked me to the back I could hear screaming from one of the rooms which caused me to stop in my tracks.

Inside the room was a homeless man and he was strapped down to a table.

He had tubes running through his body which was connected to a weird-looking contraption that was also draining his blood. He must have heard me because when he saw me, he had a look of sheer terror on his face.

I realized then, what they were doing to him. 

They had cut him open and were drinking his blood while feasting on his organs. I stood there in shock as I watched the grisly scene unfold and before I could run, I felt a prick on my arm and everything went black. 

When I finally came to, I was in an alleyway in the back of the clinic. When I stood up, everything began to spin so I braced myself against a nearby wall until the dizziness subsided. 

I clutched at my stomach and felt wetness when I looked down, I was bleeding. 

I had to get medical help and quick.

As I was making my way to the hospital, I saw my friend... 

They found his mutilated body several days later inside the now, abandoned blood bank. 

You see, on that fateful day they did something to me, they turned me into something that now craves flesh and blood. 

Over the days, I grew hungry but it became too hard for me to resist human flesh.

Of course, I was very angry at what I become and so while out feeding one night, I spotted my so-called friend...

He never saw me coming as I jumped him from behind and began sinking my teeth into his throat.

After I finished feasting on him I began drinking his blood and thought, revenge never tasted so sweet...",shortscarystories

""I'm serious John, what was that?""

""You didn't hear nothin',"" John said. ""You're just jumpy, man. There's not even fuckin' birds out here.""

They both sat in silence across the campfire, listenly intently. The campfire offered a few crackles.

""Nothin',"" John repeated, leaning back in his cheap, creaking lawn chair and taking another swig from his flask. ""It's nothin', Zach.""

""I swear, I fuckin' heard something, man,"" Zach sighed.

They sat in silence for a moment longer.

""Fuck, it's cloudy as shit tonight,"" John said, peering toward the sky. ""Can't even see the fuckin' moon.""

Zach looked up. ""Damn.""

""No rain in the forecast, though,"" John added as an afterthought. ""That's nice.""

They stared into the dark sky a little longer. A log shifted and the fire popped, making the men jump and sending floating embers high into the sky.

They looked at one another, the orange light illuminating their startled faces. After a moment, they both broke out in a quiet chuckle, which quickly led to uproarous laughter.

*snap!*

Both men stopped immediately.

""You heard that this time?"" Zach whispered.

""I did,"" John replied. ""Yeah, I did.""

*snap!*

""Fuck, dude!"" Zach shouted, his beer can splashing to the ground.

""Shut the fuck up dude!"" John whispered harshly. ""It's probably just a fucking deer, man."" He pointed in the direction of the sound. ""Look, you'll probably see it's eyes over there. They reflect light, just look.""

""Zach?"" John asked. ""What the fuck man?"" A drop hit John's head. Then another.

"So when I was about 7 my dad decided to download one of those fake ghost tracking apps that looks like a radar. At the time it was about 6am and still dark outside while we were having breakfast. My dad pulled out his phone and turned on his app and told me and my little sister to come look at it. Of course there were about 5 ghosts within the same room as us. My sister and I got scared because we were young and fell for that stuff. My dad laughed and told us it was a joke and put his phone down. Seconds after that the hallway closet door slowly opened on it's own. My dad was just as surprised as we were. He tried to play it off as there were just too many coats in there and it pushed the door open, but I know there was something else in the house with us and it wanted us to know it was there.",shortscarystories
"“That’s number 10.” Brian told her sister. “I’m going to take a peek.”

“Please be careful.” Little Jane gave her bear a tight hug. 

Brian has been counting the knocks since mother left for groceries. He knew there’s something about today that’s off. Instead of hearing the door open an hour later with mother’s usual grocery “sigh,” they both heard one heavy knock. And another and another. One knock for every hour.
Street lights lit up the puddled, empty street while a familiar car sits in front of their house.

“Do you see anything Brian?”

“Just uncle’s car.” Brian jumped down from the sofa and headed straight for the door. “I’ll be right back.”

It’s Brian’s turn to be hugged. “Please be careful.”

But Brian never came back. Little Jane’s right ear was hugging the door in front of her hoping she’ll sense her brother’s return. 

An hour later, she heard the 11th knock. She hurriedly opened the door, but there was no one outside. That’s only when she realized that the knock came from the inside.",shortscarystories
"My neighbourhood is generally so quiet. Everybody is minding their own business, which is something that i like but to be honest all of my neighbours are so unfriendly.  I've tried to make friends a few times but all i could get were icecold glances. So, naturally i don't know too much about these people.

The best side of here is the silence like i said before. I grab my coffee and watch city lights everyday, this takes away all of my stress. Kind of like a meditation.

But a little while ago, i noticed something different.

A green light.

A green laser, to be precise.

Someone was pointing a green laser to my neighbour's window. But, there was no one in sight.

It seemed strange, of course, but i brushed it off. 

I mean, it was obvious that this neighbourhood was a weird place. 

But, this started to happen every night. And my neighbour wasn't reacting to it at all. 

I looked around to see someone doing that everytime that happened, but no, there was no one around. There is no source of this green light. 

A few weeks later, i saw a bunch of people talking together, which was my first time seeing something like this in my neighbourhood. 

Then, i learned the reason. 

That ""green light"" neighbour was dead. 

""She was a healthy woman, i don't think it's because of a disease."" 

""I think that she committed suicide, what a pity.""

Weird.

What's even weirder is, a few days later, i started to see that green light again.

But, this time, it was directed towards my window.

Should i be.. worried?",shortscarystories
"Bloody words leapt from the page. 

Henry quickly pulled back. He nearly fell over, an arm swapping through the air. It nearly hit the coffee mug. 

But he managed to steady himself in time, gripping the sides of the heavy oak desk. 

And he watched as the words gnawed and gnashed. They sounded like a pencil being tapped on wood. Hungering. 

The words sought to partake in the flesh of their creator, to savor the taste of his ink, but all they found was emptiness.",shortscarystories
"It’s the day after Christmas and all is quiet. Elise is up, running around, and playing with her new toys as her parents sleep. She plays with her dolls, a new video game, and puts on her kiddie makeup.

Time flies by as she is having fun. Day turns to night and still, her parents sleep. Elise gorges herself on leftover Christmas cookies, candy, and cold Christmas ham. She drinks what’s left of her milk, juice, and water from the tap.

After two days pass, she starts to get worried, having forgotten about her parents while playing. She gently knocks on their bedroom door, not wanting to get into trouble. When her parents don’t answer, she opens the bedroom door quietly, and peeks in. What she sees horrifies her.

Her parents’ bedroom is drenched in blood. Her mother is lying in bed, her nightgown a deep shade of red as her lifeless body stares up at the ceiling. Her father, or what’s left of him, is on the ground. His Christmas pajamas unrecognizable as his head is missing from his body.

Elise screams in terror, running away as fast as her little legs can carry her. She opens her front door and runs barefoot into the snowy morning. All she sees is chaos. Bodies strewn about on front lawns, snow that should be white is almost black, children screaming and crying, and pets wandering around aimlessly.

Elise runs to her neighbor’s house and tries to open the door, but it is locked. She pulls as hard as her little arms will allow, when a paw is placed firmly on her shoulder. Too afraid to turn around, Elise sobs as she stares straight ahead.

“Elise, how was your Christmas?” A deep voice booms behind her.

“It-it was good,” she cracked as snot drips down her face.

“Why are you crying if you had a good Christmas?” The voice questions, elongating the words as they’re spoken.

“My mommy and daddy are dead!” She screams and turns around. A man over six feet tall, dressed in a poor man’s Santa outfit stares down at her. Carrying an axe in one paw and a wearing a satchel, his yellow eyes smile mischievously down at her. Shivering, Elise tries to leave but the man grabs her by the arm, scratching her in the process.

“Yes, your mother and father are dead. But I did give you, and all of the other kids in this neighborhood the greatest gift of all: no rules, no timeouts, and certainly no adults! Enjoy it while it lasts,” He winks, turning on his heel and disappearing into the woods surrounding the neighborhood, leaving the kids to fend for themselves.",shortscarystories
"Well, this is awkward. Seems like in my celebration of the holidays, I kinda forgot to post the contest for the Holiday's this year...

Yeah, I'm an idiot, and I apologize for messing it up. However, every mistake is an opportunity to adapt and overcome.

So here's what we're going to do:

* If you have posted a Holiday themed story, please leave it in the comment section of this post, and it will be grandfathered into the new contest. However, if it isn't posted below, there's no way for me to be able to find it since there isn't any tag in the title.


* Since the holidays have passed and I don't want to force anyone into continuing to beat a dead horse, this contest will be dual themed. Authors may post stories about the Holidays (stories themed around Christmas, Hanukkah, or Holiday themed) or our other theme, The End of Holi-Days; basically, stories themed around the end of the world. Zombies, robots, aliens, bugs, or bacteria, it all counts just as long as our world comes to a terribly depressing end. If authors want to write about a holiday-themed apocalypse, knock yourselves out!


* As this is the season for giving, the Top Runner Ups will also receive prizes, so there's a much higher chance of winning something if you don't come out on top.

##RULES AND REGS##

* Stories must be Holiday or Apocalypse themed. If you want to do both, go right on ahead!
All contest entries, whether Holiday themed or Apocalypse themed, must be tagged with [End of Holi-days 2019]. No-tag. No qualify. Please ensure your tags are as seen, with a capitalization of the ""E"" in ""End"" and the ""H"" in Holi-days, and the full tag. No abbreviations. Yes, this seems rather anal and restrictive, but aside from my typical madness, there is a reason for this. Reddit's search feature is rather ""specific"" on search results, so some stories don't come up unless it is tagged correctly.

* All entries must adhere to the standard subreddit rules. Entries not meeting the guidelines will be disqualified and removed. There is no re-submission on these.

* Multiple entries are allowed. One every 24 hours as our rule is typical.

* Previous contest winners and author of the month winners are allowed to participate. They may select which flair to continue with should they win the contest. Or we can work it out. I'm open to suggestions!

* Top 5 Upvoted Stories are the winners. If there are any ties or if Reddit's vote fudging makes determining a placement too difficult, authors will split the placement, and the next highest upvoted story will take the next placement until we have a winner's circle.

* If a single author claims multiple Top 5 placements, the next highest upvoted story will be added into the winner's circle among authors. We don't want to punish good writers for placing multiple times, but we also don't want to have an entire winners circle made up of the same person or people. Some contests in the past have had up to 7+ authors included in the winner's circle due to ties and multiple placements.

"This is the story of my friend who I'll call X. X is the perfect example of a maniac. I have various reasons for making this statement, but today I'm going to share just one of them with you, after which you can decide if I'm right or just too judgemental. Here it goes:

So when X was 15, she was very upset about the way her life was going. She had zero friends, had issues with her family, etc. She was a loner. She'd often skip school to hang out with some strangers. Some of these strangers were kind to her and it was this kindness that encouraged her to cut classes more.

Anyway, this one time, she just happened to hang out with a strange bunch. These were the people (she claims) who introduced her to LSD. After hanging out with them a couple more times, she decided to run away from home and live with them.

When she shared her plans, they laughed and told her she was too naïve to be part of their group, but if she really wanted, she could stay with them, provided she tried something that night. So she got to Bucky's (the loaded dude of the group) around 8 and sat wondering what it was that they wanted her to try. She waited for quite some time and watched as her new found friends got higher and higher by the minute. She almost considered leaving and that was when a man she didn't recognize approached her. He carried a plate in his hand and the plate contained raw meat. He told her 2 things: If she wanted to be part of their gang, she had to consume the meat. And that it wasn't to be confused with just any animal meat, the meat belonged to a human.

Now dear people, if it was a sane person in X's place, they would have gotten the hell out of crazy ass Bucky's place, probably or probably not have called the cops depending upon how dangerous and powerful one thought the group was, and try to forget this whole thing ever happened.

But no! What did my insanely genius experimenting mental friend do? She ate it. The whole stuff. Without a bit of guilt or regret... 

She didn't know who she'd had. She didn't know where they got it from (and honestly, I don't think she cared). All she knew was that she was happy to have a new place to call home.

She told me she never ate it again since that night. They never forced her afterwards, it was entirely her choice. But of late, she's been having these strong cravings. And she doesn't know how to keep it in control...

If you've read this entirely, I'm thankful to you- I really had to get this off my chest. And to express my gratitude, I'll tell you a secret: There is no X, this is my story.",shortscarystories
"déjà vu... That's what it felt like.. When I was 14 I had this ghastly dream. In this dream, my mother and I went shopping and I had this horrible feeling that someone or rather something followed us. Now and then I would see this blue creature try to hurt my mom and everytime I got close to her it would dissappear. When I woke up I wouldn't remember the dream at all.

Now you're probably wondering how would you write this if you couldn't remember... Well that's what I'm trying to figure out.. And it haunts me to this day..

When my mom and I would go out shopping I had this intense feeling that something bad would happen but couldn't quite put my finger on it. During our outing she would often hurt herself by accidentally knocking her shopping cart or bumping into something or tripping. And this wasn't once or twice. I ignored it eventually thinking my mom was clumsy until the day of another outing she grabbed a packet of gummy bears with blue and black printing on it and then a blueberry juice... Weirded out because she hates blueberries and almost immediately after that she tripped and fell.. It's when I had this feeling of déjà vu... I tried thinking when had this happened but realized it was in a dream... After realizing it I've never had the dream again nor has my mom gotten hurt during shopping..

To this day I've wondered if that creature is real, what could it be and why it targeted my mom specifically.",shortscarystories
"They say the best thing about Christmas is the cheer. That people are always happy. That you have to reply to someone’s “Merry Christmas” greeting, even when it’s from a complete stranger. I don’t believe so. I don’t have the urge to. I never get my family and friends presents. It’s not that I hate them, or the season. Far from it. I love Christmas. 

I just don’t want to see them smiling at me. I can’t stand the sight of their eyes, glazed over and distant. Doll’s eyes. Everyone around me is too cheerful. All the time. I always feel like I’m surrounded by mannequins.",shortscarystories
"The second I closed my eyes my dog laid down next me. When I awoke to hear his paws scratching at the door. I shut my eyes and I'm too scared to open them. I feel what ever is next to me breathing sharply. After what feels like that hours it speaks ""You might as well stop pretending I know you're awake"" It forces my eyes open and plunges it fingers through my chest. I wake up relieved it was only a dream but then I hear my dog scratching at the door. If it's not my dog then what's at my feet?",shortscarystories
" 

A lot of unfortunate things happened to Amir on Christmas. 

It was unfortunate he thought the heavy boots on his roof were Santa and his helpers.

It was unfortunate he thought sneaking downstairs as he followed the sound of footsteps moving down the side of his house was a good idea.  

It was unfortunate he never realized his daddy was on the naughty list of many, many people because of what he helped plan many years before. 

It was unfortunate that those people never forgot what Amir’s daddy helped plan. 

It was unfortunate that after 18 years, they finally found Amir’s daddy. 

It was unfortunate that those people wanted revenge, not justice.

It was unfortunate that Amir was the first person they saw when they snuck into the house.

It was unfortunate for those people that they didn’t have an excuse to blow off his head right there. 

It was unfortunate for Amir that he gave them one when he screamed:

“You aren’t Santa Clause!”

"On the night of Christmas Eve, a storm surge formed by the quaint, seaside town of Abernathy, ostensibly caused by the Hurricane Solomon. By all metrics, the storm had veered away from the coast just hours before, yet eyewitness accounts stated that a whirlwind seemed to stir a patch of sea where a beam of lightning had suddenly struck. It sent a tall wave sweeping inland, engulfing the small beach and the tiny stretch of town. The waters receded as fast as it came.

The first search-and-rescue officers arrived at the town an hour later. They expected streets flooded with murky water; houses with walls caved in and roofs torn apart; trapped victims or even dead bodies. Instead, they saw a town not out of the ordinary – the streets and the houses were quiet, too quiet. Above all, every surface was, somehow, dry.

In the first tiny beach house was an old-fashioned dining table, where a Christmas meal was laid out. The turkey was already carved into; the ham was still half-wrapped in foil, and a cork lay beside an opened wine bottle. Yet there was no one to be found: its owners appeared to have up and vanished on the spot. The windows and doors were locked from the inside, with the keys still on the table. Every house carried the same scene. Every one of the thirty-eight townspeople was simply gone.

The meteorological data pulled up was perfectly normal, with no records of the wave as ever having happened. Some said it was just a hoax. Most said it was the rapture, where God had called back thirty-eight of his most faithful servants. Hundreds flocked to Abernathy, praying for a higher power to bestow them the same salvation as the townspeople received. 

On New Year’s Eve, a volunteer had been walking along the small stretch of beach to look at the unremarkable tidal waves, perplexed and thinking, when he spotted an object sticking out of the sand and covered by seaweed. When the seaweed was brushed aside, it revealed an outstretched human hand, a finger pointing towards the sky.

The beach was excavated. Thirty-eight was the number of bodies found, buried and choked full of sand. Every single body was upright, each face sharing the same expression of strain and agony. Their arms reached upwards, while one of their feet was perched higher than the other in a climbing position. It was as if they were trying desperately to scale upwards, away from something pulling them into the depths.

Their cause of death was drowning and burning.",shortscarystories
"Archie's Grandma was his best friend, he loved everything about her from her wicked sense of humour to the way she could always make him feel better with her stories about the old days. Grandma Gracie was full of life, 80 years old and still gardening and doing all her own housework. She refused point blank to be seen as or thought of as a little old lady. Gracie seemed to have more energy than the rest of the village put together, she could always be counted upon to show up at village fetes with her famous cakes or help out at the litter pick. 

Her death shook the village to it's core, nobody could believe that Gracie, so full of life and laughter, could so suddenly have gone. Shocked neighbours stood on the village common in little groups talking in hushed tones or gathered in each others living rooms to remember her, to speak of her life and to grieve.  

Archie wanted nobodies company but Gracie's and for the first time in his life, after 12 years of being his constant companion, she was not by his side. Bitter tears gave way to a silent stillness as Archie sat alone on the stairs, refusing to speak, not wanting to eat or interact with anyone. The young boy withdrew into himself and nothing that anybody did or said seemed to make any difference to his mood. The funeral came and went with Archie shedding no further tears and showing no emotion at all, he seemed to those around him to have switched off. 

At home Archie was now spending most of his time in the bedroom nearest the bathroom. The room that had been his grandmother's. His parents would find him hours after he had gone upstairs, simply sat on her bed or lounging in her chair staring into space. 

A week after the funeral, Archie's parents had to leave him alone, both had to return to work to avoid losing their jobs. They both returned at 6pm and finding the house quiet they assumed they'd find Archie once again alone in his grandmother room. They came to a silent agreement that now was the time to speak to him, to try to get him to go outside or do something different. As they both stood at the foot of the stairs about to go up to him they were surprised to hear the sound of laughter floating down. 

Grinning at each other, relieved that Archie had recovered from his melancholy they rushed up the stairs eager to see their son smiling again. 

""Faster Grandma, Faster""

The grins faded to looks of worry and apprehension, had Archie lost his mind?

As they opened the door to the bedroom closest to the bathroom, they saw Archie sat in Gracie's chair, a chair that was spinning round at a tremendous speed. Stood behind the chair, covered in earth and still in her funeral best, was Gracie. ",shortscarystories
"It had gotten dark pretty early today. I was standing in the shadow of the tree under the street light. It was a good hiding spot to surprise them. To add to element of mystery, I decided to wear the Santa suit. Also, it went along with the season’s spirit too.

They should have been here by now, I thought. Maybe they got stuck up in the traffic. You can never predict traffic in this city; especially this time of the year.

I chuckled softly thinking of how surprised they are going to be.

While I was waiting, I lit up a cigarette. I was half-way through the smoke when I heard a scooter approaching and it stopped a few yards from me.

Annie was driving the scooter and Rose was in the back seat clutching hard at her mom’s sweater. She was almost four but still afraid of scooters. Both of them looked just as lovely as I remember seeing them when they were leaving the house this afternoon. Although, Rose did look a little upset about something.

I still had a few puffs left to smoke but I threw it away anyway. I adjusted my Santa bag around my shoulder before I started walking towards them slowly.

*******

I hope Dave is ready with the surprise because that is the only thing that can get Rose out of this mood now. We had passed by a toy store and she saw some truck that she wanted. It took her a lot of convincing to make her stop crying but it looked like she was still grieving over it.

Looking at her dad dressed as the Santa would cheer her up; I tried to convince this to myself as I parked the scooter infront of our house.

“Get down, honey”

Rose jumped off from the side and ran towards the gate while I was trying to put the scooter on the side stand. She was waiting for me to come and help her open the gate.

That was when I saw Dave coming out of the shadows. He must have been waiting for some time and that is what made him a good dad. He always went an extra mile for Rose. But still I didn’t think he would have been waiting for us outside.

It was only when he came into the light that I saw a crowbar in one of his hands. I realized this a few seconds too late that it was not Dave.

“RUN!” I turned around to Rose and screamed. She was too much into shock and was not able to process what was going on with her mom’s sudden shift of tone.

The last thing I remember seeing was Rose’s teary face and the last thing I remember feeling was the crowbar hitting me on the head.

The next time I opened my eyes, I was in the graveyard standing next to Rose and our bodies lay infront of us.",shortscarystories
"As soon as the first of the boys woke, a wave of sleepy excitement washed over them.

""Christmas!"" one of them whispered, climbing out of their bed.

""I wonder what we got this year!"" another said, despite knowing exactly what to expect.

They left the room and made their way down the hallway together, so united in their childlike wonder that they acted as one. The view was as grim as usual- simple concrete walls and a single metal door at the far end of the hall- but nothing could dampen their spirits.

One of the boys dared to pull the door's handle, and as it did only once every year, the door began to open. Slowly, carefully, he pulled the door enough so that he could fit through.

The chamber was decorated as it always was, with the same red and green lights wrapped around the same fake Christmas tree. There were seven boxes at the base of the tree- one for each boy- and a plate with seven cookies waiting on the ground nearby. Of course, a camera sat atop the tree, as it did every year.

One boy immediately ran for his cookie. It was his favorite part of the entire year, that one delicious treat to look forward to after what felt like decades in the room at the other end of the hall. As soon as he finished it, his crumb-covered mouth began to water in anticipation of next year's cookie.

Another boy frantically began searching for his present in the pile. As soon as he found it, he tore the wrapping paper away and pulled the frame out of the box. While the picture was partially obscured by the leaves and other foliage, he could clearly recognize his mother's face. She was in her garden, wiping sweat from her brow. It must have been taken in the summer.

Soon, the rest of the boys joined him, gazing upon pictures of their relatives for the first time since last Christmas. One boy cried when he saw his sister's face, as he hasn't gotten a picture of her since he was first taken, back when he was truly a boy. He barely recognized his sister's face, and wondered if she would possibly recognize his beneath the pale, scarred skin.

They spent the entire day silently gazing upon their gifts. When the warning bell began to ring, they left the pictures behind and returned to their room without daring to allow the bell to ring again.

They slept peacefully that night, their spirits healed just enough to endure another year before seeing their families again.

However, they weren't fooled by this gesture. Every one of them knew that this was just another form of torture.

They knew that they lived in Hell, but on days like this, it felt more like Purgatory.",shortscarystories

You slowly get up and walk over to the door then call out, ""*Hello*?"" but no answer. You call out again, but still no answer so you nervously grip the door handle then slowly began turning it... When you finally open it, you begin to scream because standing there in front of you, is *yourself*.",shortscarystories
"This year, Daddy said Mom might be coming home! On Christmas Day! She hasn't been home lately, Daddy said Santa needed more help and he took her. I was fine with it, because it made sense. I hope she was having fun! 

On Christmas Eve the house smelt gross! Daddy said he didn't know what it was. There was a big box next to the tree. It had me and daddy's name on it! He told me to open it, and when I did, I realized where the smell was coming from..

"I wake to being in a formless void. It feels terrifying yet familiar.

It’s pitch-black, silent, I’m kneeling in several inches of liquid.

It’s so completely dark and silent, I feel my eyes to make sure they’re open.

No sounds, not even from the liquid dripping off my arms.

An image appears in the distance, like a faraway movie screen, still silence.

The image appears blurry... It shows a dark room as it slowly comes into focus.

Movement, a door that’s opened, my Christmas tree… It’s my house, it’s like I’m watching from inside my head. I turn back to see my wife sleeping peacefully in our bed.

I’ve walked in my sleep from my medication before, but I’ve never borne witness like this.

Moving into my kitchen, the hand grabs a chef's knife, I’m returning to the bedroom.

Horror grips me, I cannot control or hear anything.

“Wake up!” I scream into the void. Nothing, I can’t even hear my own voice.

My wife lays sleeping, the knife plunging into her chest.

I scream in terror… Silence.

Her eyes opened wide in horror, blood erupting from between her lips.

The recognition in her eyes of the one who betrayed her burns my soul.

I weep uncontrollably, screaming in anguish, still silence.

I’m walking to my son’s room.

I sprint towards the screen, screaming, thrashing the liquid, anything to break free.

Silence.

I can read my sons lips “Santa?”  recognition dawning in his sleepy  eyes “Daddy?”

Oh god no... Please no!

The knife slices through his throat to the bone.

I scream in horror… Silence.

His eyes showing the confusion of trusting love not comprehending why…

I run again, screaming in anger and terror, the screen staying ever present in its distance to me. I change direction, the screen adapting to my orientation.

Silence, I’m weeping uncontrollably, but nothing can be heard.

The images show the knife being pointed at myself, my body leaning forward.

“Please just end it.” Maybe this will wake me up if it’s a dream, “Please just do it.”

I return to the void, I’m not sure how much time passes, I sob continually, reliving the horror.

I’ve cried so many tears the liquid feels deeper.

My only hope is thinking that this is a nightmare and I will wake up soon.

...

I wake to being in a formless void. It feels terrifying yet familiar.

It’s pitch-black, silence, I’m kneeling in nearly a foot of liquid.

It’s so completely dark and silent, I feel my eyes to make sure they’re open.

No sounds, not even from the liquid dripping off my arms.

"Nice kids are put on the nice list. They get presents. They get rewarded for everything they've done throughout the year with whatever they want, sometimes even if it's undeserved.

Naughty kids are put on the naughty list. They don't get presents. The ones who aren't as special as the nice kids get punished with either absolutely nothing, or receive nothing more than black coal.

But there's another list, too. 

Every Christmas, Santa chooses approximately 500 random children to put on the third list. Those children wake up to Santa standing over their bed, opening up his famous sack and inviting them to look inside.

But the sack doesn't just carry presents.

The children are all carried to the North Pole to a remote location. They were all promised to be able to spend a day with Santa, and that's what they all got! They got to see Santa, see his reindeer, and get a view of the behind the scenes of Christmas.

But the children never come back.

Santa orders that the children never go back to their lives of luxury and happiness. Instead, Santa has the children stay with him forever. Forever and ever.

And so the children are trapped in the North Pole. They're all trapped, forced to read endless letters from innocent children, forced to create endless presents for innocent children. They can no longer enjoy Christmas once they have to make Christmas.

All because they were put on the third list.

"Sam had always been interested in the occult, the obscene, the cryptic.

So when he saw the dusty tome in the back of his favorite arcane shop, he knew he had to buy it. 

That night, he opened the book to a random page. It seemed to contain detailed instructions on summoning an unspeakable demon, Be'laakrah. Excitedly, Sam sent a text to Marty and Abe, his two best friends. These things were always more exciting, more exhilarating, with some friends.

Although they were skeptical, the two were over quickly. When they arrived, Sam already had his room set up for the ritual. 

Marty looked around the room apprehensively. He was always a little nervous about these things; the knife, pentagram, and incense in the room did nothing to alleviate his fears. ""I'm not sure about this, guys,"" he said. ""This looks a lot more genuine than the other ones we pretended to summon."" 

""Who's pretending?"" Retorted Sam. 

Always looking to impress, Abe teased Marty. ""You chicken?"" He asked. He proceeded to walk around the room, flapping his arms and clucking. 

Blushing, Marty backed down. ""Alright, alright... what do we gotta do, Sam?"" 

Sam looked down at the tome in his hands. Everything felt much more real right now. He lit the incense by the doorframe, the only entrance in or out of the room. ""So... according to the book, Be'laakrah needs permission to access this earthly plane. If each of us says his name and then exits the doorway, we grant him permission to enter."" 

Without further thought, he harshly cried, ""Be'laakrah!"" and walked through the door. He then gestured towards Abe. 

Abe looked at Sam, who was watching expectantly. Trying to act tough, he muttered the demon's name and walked through the door. Both Sam and Abe turned to Marty, who was as white as a sheet. 

""Guys, I dont know about this..."" he stuttered, only to be cut off by the squawking imitation of a chicken from his friends. His face set with resolve. With determination, he yelled, ""Be'laakrah!"" And turned towards the door, about to step through. And stopped. 

It stood before him in all of its grotesque glory, blocking his entrance through the doorway. 

Abe let out a squeak. His pants became wet as the smell of urine pervaded the air. Sam just stood there, his eyes wide. 

The creature looked at Marty, who's knees were trembling. It pointed at him and opened one of its mouths. A hollow, rasping noise came out. ""...do not...summon...Be'laakrah..."" Somehow, the creature looked terrified. 

And then it disappeared. 

The three young men looked at each other. Sam threw up, his vomit spattering on the carpet. Abe wasn't aware of the mess on his pants. Marty couldn't move. He was looking at his friends. 

The ritual wasn't complete, and there was only one way to leave the room. It was through the doorway. 

He knew he would have to go through eventually.",shortscarystories
"I'm not sure how to feel. I've never died. I have never died and I feel...different? I'm not sure what it was that I felt. I'm not sure if I'm alive or not. I feel...less than human, or, perhaps, I'm just a human who dies and lives again. I don't know. I'm not sure if I'm alive or not.

I've been in this moment for the longest time. I know it is strange, but I can't help but feel it. The moment I die, I'm reincarnated as human, as a human living in a human body. I feel I'm still alive, but I'm not. I don't know how to feel. I don't want to feel. But it feels *good*. Just as good as I do.

This is what I'm going to do. I'm going to die. And maybe, just maybe, I'll return to my body. I know this is impossible, but it feels better than anything. I'm going to die and maybe, just maybe, I'll return to my body.

I can't tell if this is a dream or if I'm simply imagining. I'm going to die, and maybe, just maybe, I'll come back to my body. So I'm going to die. And maybe I'll come back to my body.

"We don’t like to put up a Christmas tree. Not because of the shedding and hassle of getting one through the door, though that’s part of it. 

No.

"“Thanks for picking the place tonight!” 

I sat across a handsome face at a new, up-and-coming restaurant (or so I’ve been told); anxious and excited. This was the first date I’ve had in a long while after getting out of a rather toxic relationship with my fiancé of three years, so to finally get back in the dating pool and give things another try was a mix of emotions. Excitement. Nervousness. Fear. Yet, it was all coated with a thin layer of giddiness.

“Not a problem. I heard a lot of good things about this place from a few friends and my past experiences here have been great! I’m sure you’ll enjoy it.” My date, Vincent, smiled back at me, preening under my gratitude as he tapped his fingers along the dark wooden table as we sat. 

Yet, despite this place being a “new” and “popular” restaurant, there was hardly anybody in here. I took it as a sign that it was a very ‘underground’ restaurant, a rare-find among the many in Chicago that you had to know where to look.

We idled with conversation as I perused the menu. It struck me a little odd that there weren’t any descriptions or pictures; just names and prices, which even still, were a little difficult to decipher. Vincent leaned over the table and began to point to a few of the items on the back side of the menu, mentioning that they were great starters if you were new to the food and wanted a something milder. I nodded slowly and settled on one of the items. 

The waiter, a smaller woman, came over and eventually took our orders and handed our drinks out. She seemed overly pleased at my dinner choice and shared a glance with Vincent. I noticed it immediately, and I suppose the look on my face cued him off.

“Oh, sorry, she’s an old friend from high school” He explained. 

Eventually, the small waitress placed our food down, bowed her head slightly, and scurried away back around the corner.

The food tasted… *off*. I don’t know why. It’s something I couldn’t quite place, whether it was the style of cooking, the seasoning, or what. I could feel myself growing sick

I excused myself, went to the bathroom, and as I headed back, that’s when I saw it. 

Through the window of the kitchen door, I saw blood. Blood and a small chunk of arm being chopped up by the chef. 

I ran.

Vincent noticed the panic and stood up, startled, asking me what happened. I started crying and pointing at the back, towards the doors, incomprehensible and sputtering.

He followed to look at where I was pointing and the worry from his face vanished, turning into a blank expression, maybe even a bit disappointed and annoyed.

“*Oh.* I thought something actually happened. Tonight was going so well, too…” He sighed, before latching onto my arm and dragging me, kicking and screaming into the kitchen.",shortscarystories
"Finally, it's Christmas time again. I'm already fifthteen, I didn't really ask for anything. I saw the normal shaped presents. Then I saw *It.*  the box was all pointy.

"""I’m hungry"", said my wife. My son who was seating in the back seat of the car said “I second that”. We were coming back from a trip to our hometown and it was Sunday around noon. 

We made this same trip every few months to visit friends and family, but this time coming back was a little different. We had to take a detour because the main highway was blocked with a major traffic accident. 
We had to go back a couple of miles and find an alternate route; this new route took us through some small towns in rural Texas we have never been through before. 

We've always enjoyed exploring the byways but we were a little pressed for time since we had to work the following day. We always liked to have at least a full afternoon to rest after a trip and we didn’t know how long this way was going take us. In any case, we were all hungry and we were coming into a small town.  

We didn’t noticed the name but it was one of those dying towns that seem to be barely clinging to life. Nonetheless, it was a quaint little place, and best of all, there were a few places to eat. 
We drove around for a bit trying to decide where to have lunch. We had past by this restaurant in a corner in the downtown area that seemed nice. We found a parking spot and went in. 

The place had a German theme and the decor was old but nice. We were seated right away and the waitress was very friendly. We ordered our food and it was ready very quickly. The food was not great but it was a lot better than some we’ve had in other places. 

Our son spent most of his time on his phone watching videos and texting his friends as children nowadays often do.  It was time to pay the bill and head out, so I called the waitress and asked for the check. She came back shortly after and I paid her. 
We walked out of the restaurant and over to the car which was parked around the corner from the place. We got in the car and got ready to leave when our son yelled “stop! I forgot my phone in the restaurant!” I shut the car off and told him to go back and get it. 
He took a bit longer than he should and when he finally came back, he had a baffled look in his face. 
He climbed into the car and said “the place is closed!” I said ""that can’t be, we just walked out not five minutes ago, go back and knock on the door, they’re in there, they have to clean up...! and ""no"", he interrupted, ""you don’t understand! The place is closed and it seems like it has been closed for a long time, it looks old and run down. I don’t know what’s going on”.  
My wife and I turned to look at him, I said, ""let’s go see"", thinking that he didn’t want to knock because he’s a young boy, and sometimes they act a little weird (or a lot). 
We both got out of the car and walked around the corner to the restaurant. To my surprise and disbelief, the place looked dilapidated as if it had been abandoned for a long time, it didn’t look like that when we went in, at least not that I noticed. 

I tried to see through the glass on the door but was not able to make out anything inside. Then, I saw an old woman sweeping the sidewalk next door to the place and I walked over to her and asked her about the place. She said, “that restaurant has been closed for more than 20 years"". 
She said that the owners had left after a legal battle with the city and that’s why the place was just abandoned.
I told her that we had just been in there, and she said that we better be careful because if the police were to see us breaking in we would be in trouble. 
I didn’t want to say anything else to her, I knew how it would’ve sounded, we walked back to the car scratching our heads. 
Then as we were walking by a window on the side of the restaurant, I looked at the inside of the place. I could see the table we had sat at, it was full of dust and cobwebs everywhere. 

The paintings on the walls were crooked and some were on the floor as they had fallen from the wall where they had been, but right there, on the corner of the table, there it was, my son’s phone. 
I got my phone out of my pocket and called his, I could see the screen lighting up, but nothing on the table seem disturbed, there was no indication of anybody having been in there. We got in the car and left. 

The ride back to the house was very quiet; I thought we were confused enough, so I didn’t tell my son or my wife that I had seen the phone through the window. To this day, I have no idea what happened there. 

All I can say is that we never went that way again. It’s been many years since that trip but I still remember like it was yesterday, and still get chills thinking about it.",shortscarystories
"Christmas Eve promised excitement. And this year, I wanted Santa to give me the greatest gift of all: family.

I hoped and prayed. Sent Santa so many letters.

Soon, December twenty-fourth arrived. Then came midnight. As far as I knew, not a creature was stirring. Daddy’s holiday playlist all I heard. 

To my delight, I heard thumping over the music. Then came a thud downstairs.

I entered the living room. There was daddy at the towering tree. He reached inside the branches, spilling several ornaments.

“Dad,"" I said.

My father whirled around. Red stains scattered across his beard and pajamas. “Helene! Why aren’t you in bed?”

 “I couldn’t sleep, daddy.""

His cold stare fixated on me. “You shouldn't have come down here.""

Frozen in fear, I looked around the room. “I just wanted to see Santa.”

Dad reached back toward the tree.

Heavy footsteps startled me. I turned to see a smiling man . 

The red and white hat made his identity obvious. As did the big belly. But even in the red jacket, Santa wasn’t what I expected. The beard was too dirty. Santa’s face too angular.

Santa slammed his sack of toys onto daddy’s head.

Dad fell to the ground. His groans quieted once Santa threw the bag down over and over again.

Sweating, Santa Claus dropped the heavy bag.

On the floor, dad laid motionless. His face in slimy smithereens.

I looked toward Santa.

His smile reassured me. Calm, Santa pointed toward the Fraser Fir.

Buried in the tree, I saw what daddy was about to grab: a long knife.

Then I saw what else the Fraser Fir had been hiding...

Mom’s body lied behind it. A clean red line ran across her throat.

I looked at dad’s corpse. The man who was my father. And my mother’s killer.

A supportive grip grabbed my arm. I faced Santa.

“You’ll be fine, Helene,” he said in a gentle voice

Enraptured, I watched Santa hold up a few ripped pieces of notebook paper. Instantly, I recognized the scribbled scrawlings. Recognized my many Christmas lists for the North Pole.

“I’ve been listening,” Santa told me. “Now you'll be in my family, Helene.”

I showed a smile. At seven years old, I was finally free.

Santa led me outside. To a red convertible.

We both got in. I never once worried. Not even when that convertible took up off the ground. Nor when the radio gave way to an emergency news bulletin...

“A patient from the Americus Mental Hospital broke out just a few hours ago,” a panicking reporter told us. “The suspect is Kris Kringle, a man dressed in a Santa Claus outfit. He was committed for several child kidnappings in 2006 and is considered extremely dangerous.”   

Still, I didn’t care. Santa had given me a fresh start. A fresh family.

Against the wind, Santa changed stations.

I closed my eyes in the cold. Thought about our bright future. How my greatest Christmas gift had only just begun.",shortscarystories
"
I live alone in a small house in the outskirts of Vegas, just me and my cat Murphy. We’ve been partners for close to 5 years now and been through love,  heartbreak, power and water shut-offs, and all the ups and downs that life throws your way in half a decade’s time. I bought this home foreclosing just six months ago in not the best of neighborhoods but money has always been tight and mortgage payment beat renting in the long run. Things have been pretty smooth since, we’ve only heard a few sets of sirens since moving in. Well, smooth until last week that was. Going about my regular morning business one day, I walked past my patio door, and saw an oily smudge on the glass near head level. I really didn’t register it the first moment I saw it but as I poured my cereal it really clicked in my head. I hadn’t put my face against that window and I hadn’t had any company recently so it couldn’t have come from anyone I knew. 
Fuck it, maybe some would-be thief thought to check out what goods I might have in my house and saw there wasn’t anything worth the trouble inside. It was morning after all and I had seen no sign of trouble in the house. The smudge could’ve been from last week for all I knew. I was cutting it close with time before I had to leave for work so my mind wandered off to other things like grabbing my wallet and making sure the cat had food and water before leaving. 

10 hours later, I was finally home, after dark but thankful I didn’t have to work a 12. I tossed my wallet and keys on the kitchen counter and went upstairs to unwind the day’s stresses. Bathroom, shower, change. I walked out of the bathroom and the lighting from outside hit just right that a smudge on my bedroom window caught my eye as I headed to bed. 
“What the fuck!” 
I was actually creeped out now, my window was high up and it meant some clown had to have gone through the trouble of actually putting up a ladder to get to it. I turned on the lights and checked my little stash of cash beneath the mattress (I know, cliche spot) shooing Murphy away in the process. It was intact. He must be planning on robbing me later, I’ll buy a couple broken cameras from eBay and put them up as a deterrent, I thought. You have to understand, buying a gun is kind of expensive and I’d rather do everything I can before having to shoot someone inside and probably lowering my home’s sell value. I went downstairs, lighting every part of the house as I walked through it and got the Windex+ paper towel and headed back up to my room. I slid the window open and put my hand out with the paper towel drenched in windex to clean up the smudge. I scrubbed and nothing happened. 

I realized the smudges were on the inside.",shortscarystories
" 

The cup of hot chocolate burned my hand a little, but it didn’t bother me. My other hand was resting on the window, and the cold I felt through the glass created a perfect balance. One hand hot, other cold.

It was snowing a lot. The perfect Christmas card, I thought and a calm smile stretched across my face. Everything was perfect-the hot chocolate, the snow, the dim lights of the Christmas tree on the other side of the room. I even started warming up to the Christmas music. 

It muffled the screams nicely.

I sipped the rest of my drink and turned around to face my family. My parents were on the floor, tied up and struggling to get further away from me.

“Hey, it’s not like I enjoy your company either”, I mumbled to myself. I put the mug down and slowly lifted the knife from the table. My dad's eyes widened and he tried to scream, but all that came out was muffled, incoherent panic.

“Which one will go first?” I asked silently. There were tears in my moms eyes. Tears that almost made me pity her. But the pity melted away quickly.

“Maybe I’ll start with you. Dad, watch closely”, I smiled and stepped forward. I lifted the knife to my mom's throat, ready to slice it open…

The door of my room slammed shut. I opened my eyes. They were staring straight into my mothers small, pig-like eyes. She grinned with disgust and stepped away. Her face, once beautiful but spoiled after years of living in a constant state of anger and self-pity, her horrible personality poking out of every wrinkle, every imperfection that was sprayed across her face 

“Get your worthless ass up. It’s noon”.

I didn’t reply. Instead, I slowly got out of bed, staring into my mother’s eyes the whole time. She narrowed her eyes and stared at me back, not even trying to hide the utter disgust that she had for me. 

“Go tidy up. And hide those bruises. Our relatives will visit and I don’t want to deal with the questions”.

“Go fuck yourself”, I mumbled as I walked past her, but I didn’t say it quietly enough. She grabbed my hair and forced me to turn to face her ugly face.

“What did you just say to me, you little shit?”

“Nothing”, I replied. She slapped me. I turned my face away and lifted my hand to cover up my tears.

“You truly are worthless”, she shook her head and stormed out. 

It was snowing a lot. The perfect Christmas card, I thought. The dim lights of the Christmas tree, the Christmas music. My dad, already drunk, yelling something from the other room and smashing plates.

The knife was still in my bedroom, hidden under some school books. 

Maybe next Christmas, I thought as I sipped the hot chocolate and pressed my hand to the window screen.

Maybe next Christmas I’ll do it.",shortscarystories
"It might be said:

**(Translated from Cantonese)**

I hate Christmas because it's the hardest time of the year for me. I wasn't always this resentful, though. I use to beam like the sun, but that was a long time ago.

Now, I'm a grunt; all of us are. We toil and live at the discretion of masters that couldn't fathom our existences. Criminals dare not hope for more than that, so we dare not hope at all. This is reality in the gulag.

Some sow, others solder, even more configure, but all must work, or be devoured by the beast. We are mice to our hawkish overseers. They soar overhead scanning for fracturing obedience. Today though, their behavior is erratic. I heard, our working conditions were leaked to the western world in a very shameful way. So of course, they're itching to restore our confidence in their dominance.

Even from here Wan's cluelessness to these subtleties is obvious, as his emaciated body saunters aimlessly through the working masses. Doubtlessly, he's been missing quota, a lot of us have, and if you don't work you don't eat. Unfortunately, this is the worst time to be in a stupor, and Wan, is beelining towards disaster. I try to intercede, but my attempts to warn him only hasten that outcome. And when he knocks over a guard, his fate is sealed, poor Wan.

Our eyes meet, but I don't offer any sentiments. What good could they do him now? He's destined for the beast. The guard pulls Wan along. They halt just outside the beast's enclosure. Its edifice fortified by cinder blocks that etch out the dimensions of a cube. Its door akin to tank armor rather than material for a proper entry way, but all things considered, maybe that's best.

Despite its physique, the door isn't impermeable. It has one rectangular view-port carved into it, that sits at a normal man's eye level, and three fist sized air holes that hang a foot above the ground.

A grin flits across the guards face. He, now a fire with enthusiasm, clenches the keys secured about his trousers. They jingle as he searches them for the door's only key. Of course, this is all spectacle. He knows that key by heart. he's savoring Wan's misery. After, he's had his fill, the guard inserts the key into the door. The lock clinks to acceptance, then he swings the door open.

Wan peers into an abyss. Urine flows down his leg pooling at his feet. As it slows to a trickle the the guard shoves him into the cell and slams the door shut. The force sends Wan reeling to his knees. Wan ignores the pain, though. Instead, he's transfixed on the beast. Its appearance is maddening. Wan couldn't conjure this vision, let alone reason with it if he tried, yet, overcome, Wan attempts an emotional appeal. Its wasted though. I'm no longer his friend. I am the beast.",shortscarystories
"Dad used to dress up as Santa at Christmas and deliver our presents to our rooms. Even as we got older we loved seeing him in that costume. It was the highlight of the holidays when he'd emerge from kitchen with a huge sack full of presents.

Every year around October he would start planning that years ""Santa Visit"" and each year it would get more elaborate as he pulled out all the stops to make Christmas really special. From hiring several live reindeer to bringing along an entire busload of elves we always knew we were in for a real treat. 

This year he kept hinting at something really big and special, several times we heard him muttering ""the best one yet"" to himself as he pored over his laboriously collated plans for the event. He'd always name his Santa Visit events and this year's was no different. 

""Down the chimney"" was what the police found written on front page of his planning.

And that's where they found him. They said he'd got stuck and suffocated while practising his stunt. His sack of presents had fallen onto his face muffling his cries for help. He'd died slowly.

If you do something he won't like,

Reaching from above.

Bellow all around,

It’s deeper than I thought it’d be,

It’s quite a raspy sound.

About Santa’s black and red

"Amber was really starting to regret ignoring the weather forecast today.

It was late, and she was still driving home, despite knowing that it was supposed to snow, and hard. However, she’d only been about ten minutes from home, so everything should be fine.

The roads were so familiar. She knew them like the back of her hand. Every turn, she had made a hundred times before. Except...

Why wasn’t that turn there? 

Convinced she was just being paranoid and had already taken it, she kept going. Everything seemed normal enough. 

She could have sworn there wasn’t a hill there, though. She knew there wasn’t.

She continued to think herself paranoid, until she realized she’d been driving for fifteen minutes. She should have reached her home five minutes ago. And were the roads... repeating? As if she’d just left? 

No. That couldn’t be. She’d have to keep driving and hope. She’d find it soon.

She drove for hours. The roads repeated as if she’d just left over and over again, and the terrain was just wrong every time. She tried to stop the car, but it never let her. She was starting to see faces out there in the snow, twisted and horrible. 

Amber had a feeling she wouldn’t be making it home in time for Christmas tomorrow.

"“Yes, Penelope, I bought us milk and ingredients to make cookies… yes, dear, that too… uhuh, mmhm. *Okay,* love you, see you soon, dear.”

The woman hung up as she weaved through parking lot traffic; several cars flipped their turn signals on as she struggled to remove her keys from her purse—shopping bags dangled on her forearms. She placed the bags in the backseat as snowflakes brushed her face. Suddenly, a loud bang as from a car crash filled the parking lot, followed by screams. She looked around hastily. A man honked and threw his hands up in a large truck awaiting her parking space. The screams continued, childrens’ and adult’s.

She looked around maneuvering through parked cars. The man in the truck flipped her off as black smoke billowed from the exhaust.

“Help, somebody, please!” A woman cried.

She moved toward the voice and incessant screams, and nobody seemed to be concerned; several people looked around drinking their Starbucks but simply carried on in their own holiday cheer.

“Mommy! Where are you!”

Panic overtook the woman as she trotted in front of shoppers. ‘Watch where you’re going!’ A man yelled with his family.

Her breathing grew heavy. “How come… nobody hears this?”

“Michelle! Somebody, *please* help us! Oh, God, please!”

“Hang on!” The woman screamed. Shoppers and traffic carried on.

The woman followed the children’s cries until she stopped between two large vehicles. Several people stood around a mounted speaker. The screams and cries ceased.

“Merry Christmas, ma’am.” A man shook her hand, followed by another man and woman.

“What’s…” The woman caught her breath. “What’s going on here?”

The other man chimed in, “Everything is *A-Okay.* We’re with the city.”

“I don’t understand?” She looked around confusingly.

The other woman replied. “You’re the only person in over a dozen shopping centers to respond today. You did the right thing in being helpful to others in need this holiday season.”

“Oh? Isn’t this extreme?”

“Is it?” The first man asked, pulling out paper from his coat. “What if this really had happened to such a family?”

The woman smiled and nodded.

“And on behalf of the mayor and channel 9, we would like to give you and your family a thousand dollar check.”

“Wow!” She accepted it. “Thank you *so* much. You don’t know how much this will help my husband and I out this year.”

“No, really, thank you misses…”

“Saunter.”

He shook her hand. “Mrs. Saunter. Merry Christmas.”

“Merry Christmas.” She shook their hands and parted ways.

She walked joyfully back to her vehicle, gazing at her newly gained money which would provide for her household a wonderful Christmas, and even help pay down some debt. But as she crossed a busy aisle, a loud honk filled her ears and a car slid into her. The check floated up and away with the wind and snow.

Sharon sat on the couch, and stared into the fire. A festive tree sat decorated in the corner. Her grandkids lay asleep upstairs. But Sharon was waiting for one thing.

The bastard had left her the day of Christmas. She hated him for it. It was his favorite holiday, but that last year he couldn't appreciate it. Christmas was now cold and sad for her. It wasn't the same without him. She would give anything to have him back.

And hand on her shoulder, filled the room with warmth and color. She smiled and stood up. She couldn't do that so easily on an average night, a bad back made that task painful and hard. But Charles was here. 

He held her hand as they looked into each other eyes. No words from either. The crackle of the fire, was all either heard. She felt cold bitter tears fall down her cheeks. But she couldn't help but smile as she held him. She felt thirty years younger with him, but then again his passing aged her beyond her years.

They slow danced in each other's arms to the Christmas music playing in their heads. Charles going as far as to hum a couple. All that mattered is that they were together. The room was golden, and bright, just like his eyes. She laughed as he twirled her around and pulled her to his lips. Dancing for ever.

""I have to go.""

 He gave a sad smile, lines suddenly aging his face. Her knees bent, and her back shook with the strain of standing.

""No! Not yet! Take me with you!"" He shook his head and lifted his head towards the stairs. Her eyes followed his, up to her grandchild sitting on the stairs.

""Grandma?""

""Are you sure you want to go, and leave her behind?""

Sharon shook her head, and let go of him and held her hands out.

She felt a smile grow on her lips as her grankid ran into her arms. The room was dark and cold without him. She missed him already.

But he didn't need her yet.

It was the night before Christmas, and as always, Charles was in the house.",shortscarystories
"I woke up in a dim room. I wasn’t really sure where I was. There was yellow wallpaper with a very familiar design on the walls. I could hear the buzzing of the fluorescent light bulbs. I didn’t have any memory of falling asleep. I could remember my name. It’s George. I didn’t remember how I got here. There was a door. Should I go through? I couldn’t decide. I was scared to go through the door. I decided to open the door despite my fears. There was another room. It’s identical to the previous one. Another door. I open it. Again, there is another identical room. I open the next door and finally there is a change. This room has an open doorway leading to a narrow hallway. I walk down the hall to a door at the end of the hallway. I look behind me and see that I am miles from the start of the hallway. I couldn’t have gotten that far. It felt like 30 seconds. I open the door at the end of the hallway. Another room, just like the one I woke up in. It feels like I’ve been here for hours now. Where am I. I may be in hell or something of the same sense.",shortscarystories

12:03am - My father always told me to not go near the factory that is a block down from our home. He suspects they’re running some type of experiment.

3:54am - I got into an argument with my wife - and I killed her. I don’t know what to do. It seems like somebody was watching the whole time.

8:17am - I woke up today and my wife was right next to me in bed. I thought I killed her last night. It all felt too realistic.

"My mother never really liked Christmas. She always complained it was too festive, or that it was just an excuse for people to get drunk off eggnog. She wanted to change it and make it more bearable for herself. 

And she did. 

She always said she wanted to kill Santa Claus. 

And that year, she did. 

The Christmas that year started out like any other Christmas. We had rented a Santa Claus to make the evening more authentic. (At the time, I truly believed we had gotten the real Santa, but looking back on that, I’m amazed by my stupidity.) Everyone was partying and having a good time. Except for my mother. She was in a chair in the living room reading a book. Not unlike her in the least, yet still suspicious. I decided to keep an eye on her. 

But I got distracted with the plates of cookies scattered throughout the house. After a couple minutes, I glanced at the chair and saw my mother was missing. I went over to Santa Claus and asked him if he had seen my mother. He said he hadn’t. I felt worried for him, knowing my mother hated Santa. 

After another couple minutes of looking, I gave up and decided she went to bed. My stomach full of desserts, I sat down on a couch and fell asleep. The last thing I realized was that Santa was missing too. I wonder if my mom killed him, I thought. I smiled, and went to sleep. 

Suddenly, I heard pounding on the front door. I quickly woke up to frantic whispering and moving feet. The door was opened and cops entered. 

“We received a call that there was suspicious activity going on in this house. Where’s the owner?” asked one of the officers. 

Everyone shrugged, not knowing where my parents were. The officers began searching the house. I went up to one of the officers and said my parents are probably just sleeping. 

They ran up the stairs, looking for the room. 

Doors were opened, closets were searched. 

And then they found the door. They slowly opened the door, and gasped at what they saw. 

My father lay there bleeding out of the mouth and a knife sticking straight up out of his chest. Blood gurgled and dripped to the floor. His eyes were wide open. He was staying motionless and barely gasping for breath. 

The officers saw that a window was opened. They concluded my mother left the house with the rented Santa Claus. 

Later, the officers found a note underneath my father scribbled in red and green crayons that asked:

“Who do you think actually gave you presents on Christmas morning?”",shortscarystories
"It was midwinter when they first appeared in the sky. The lights. They first seemed like normal stars but astronomers worldwide were puzzled. They didn't look like any type of stars that had been observed before. So everyone just thought that it was a new type of star, never before seen by humanity.

But then the news came. A team of astronomers in Canada had observed that the lights came closer to Earth. And at a remarkable speed to. The astronomers estimated that they moved at half the speed of light. In just a few days they grew from small white dots to glowing red spheres half the size of the moon. 

But what no one had realized was that the lights wasn't dangerous, they were merely lights, nothing else. They wouldn't be the end of humanity. But the things that came from below would.",shortscarystories
"“Sir, please excuse me… I don’t think this is the way to my house.” Anna said from the backseat, kicking herself for accepting a ride from a stranger. 

This guy looked official though, he even had the grill between the backseat and the driver, just like the police.

“It’s OK sweetie… I know a shortcut” Clyde said flashing her a quick smile. He couldn’t believe his fortune, she was beautiful, youthful but not child-like, her dark eyes and light skin had caught his attention while she walked alone at night. Most appealingly, he didn’t recognize her as being from his neighborhood. 

He patrolled with the neighborhood watch for years now. An epidemic of missing persons gripped his city. After he started patrolling, his neighborhood had been spared.

He turned the sedan onto a small gravel road that led to an isolated industrial site. “Sir? This really doesn’t seem like the right way.” She said, covertly trying the door handles. 

“Sir? Please!... You’re starting to scare me.”

“It’s going to be okay darling… just relax.” His grin now had an ominous quality in the dim light from the dashboard.

She was now nearing full panic, trying both door handles, the windows, finally shaking the grill between the backseat and him. “Please Sir! This isn’t the way. Please let me out! My family will be looking for me!” she begged.

Clyde parked the car under the cover of an old rusty steel building, turning for another look at her in the backseat. “It’s going to be alright, just sit tight… I’ll be right back.” He said, flashing her a wink.

She was now hysterical, trying to kick the windows, scream for help, anything she could to get free from her prison. 

Clyde opened the trunk and removed his kit. He flashed back to the first time he had done this and how many mistakes he had made. “This one would not get away, and they would never find a trace of her.” He thought, calming his nerves. 

He methodically organized his tools on a table beside the car, occasionally checking on Anna. Was she praying? “That’s foolish” he thought. 

He kept the gun on her, opening the door, coaxing “Come out. I’ll make it quick.”

Her fear had subsided, a small grin as she looked up. “You know… bullets won’t kill me.” 

He smiled knowingly; she hadn’t reflected in his mirrors.

“Yes…. But the holy water in this water gun will burn so...” her grin fading “Please just come out and I’ll make it painless.” He said, subliminally pondering why her grin had returned more sinister.

He didn’t notice the being behind him until the fangs punctured his neck. Realizing too late that he left the wooden stake on the table and that she wasn’t praying, she was calling for help telepathically.

Anna slid from the backseat to join the feeding; pausing to look into his panicked eyes “Sir… I told you that my family would be looking for me.”",shortscarystories
"It's been five days.

Five days since the last time I got a full night's sleep. I just lay there, staring at my bedroom ceiling, not really thinking about anything, just… staring. Watching the shadows dance with the pale lights of the lonesome midnight traffic. I lay, feeling my body sink into the bed, as if its weight was only an afterthought.

It's been five long and restless nights. My mind wanders through random thoughts, barely registering any one of them. Every once in a while I look at her, sleeping right next to me, and my turmoil goes away for a few seconds.

It comes back, though, relentless. I feel anxious, the fear on the back of my mind eager to put itself front and center. Even though she's there, I dread loneliness. Even though she's right there, lying on my bed, I feel alone.

I look at her. Her beautiful dark hair mirroring the darkness of the night, her peaceful slumber a stark contrast to my distress. I try to calm myself by watching her, as if her lovely image could shed away all the horror, but in reality I know this will only fuel it further.

Because, even though she's there, and I can hear her gentle breathing and I can feel her warmth, the truth is she should be lying where I said my last goodbye so many nights ago. Because, even though there's nothing that I would want more than to hold her one last time, I don't know who or what is lying right next to me, but it's not her. Because she is gone, and accepting it was the hardest thing I ever did.

She was gone, and five days ago she came back, and is lying on my bed, and I haven't been able to sleep ever since.",shortscarystories

"Hello, my name is Jack and I’m 9 years old.

I live with my mummy and daddy and my older sister Sarah, she’s 12.

Daddy works as a doctor, but he’s had to take a lot of time off recently because he has to look after mummy because she’s sick.

Mummy will often run up and down the halls at night screaming. I don’t like mummy when she does that, but daddy says I’m not to open the bedroom door under any circumstances.

Mummy will sometimes try to get into my room, but the door is always locked. Daddy says no matter how much mummy asks no matter how much mummy demands that I open the door, it is to remain locked at all times.

Mummy will sometimes talk to herself at night, but she replies in voices that don’t sound like her. They say mean and nasty things and sound very angry. When mummy speaks she sounds like she’s in pain and she’s crying. I don’t like this most of all.

Sarah says that if I don’t listen to daddy something bad will happen, like it happened to Simon.

I once had an older brother called Simon, he was 17, he opened the door to mummy one night to try and make her stop. But we heard him scream and then we never saw him again. Daddy only found a pool of blood outside his door.

Sometimes when mummy speaks, I think I can hear Simon too. He sounds like he’s in pain. But I know better than to open the door and ask mummy if he’s alright.

Anyway I just wanted to write this down because last night through the door mummy whispered to me about having a sleep over and told me to invite all of my friends, but I don’t really have many friends because people at school now think I’m weird. But you’ll come over, won’t you?",shortscarystories

"Never before had I seen such beauty. My favorite meal from another time of my life seemed like garbage compared to the masterpiece laid before me. ""Bon appetit,"" said the waiter, as he left me to my meal. Charmaine, soon to be future wife, raised her glass. ""To one full year, she said. ""To one full year,"" I reciprocated. We clinked our glasses. 

Up until the day that I had met Charmaine, my life was all but dead and going nowhere. It wasnt until Charmaine had found me in an alley, a needle in my arm, and presented me a choice. For me the answer was obvious. One full year later, I was healthier, stronger, and more full of life than I had ever been. With Charmaine's support and love, I became more than I was ever meant to be. I became the man that society never believed I could be. I was strong, determined, and unstoppable. I deserved this celebration, and there was only one last thing I sought to claim... Charmaine's hand in marriage. 

I tapped my spoon to my glass and a group of men took to the stage before our table. They grabbed instruments and began playing Charmaine's favorite song. Charmaine looked at me with glossy eyes, as I from my seat, and dropped to one knee. I then presented a diamond ring, and asked for her hand in marriage. She said yes and the other patrons applauded. ""You've made me the happiest man in the world,"" I said. ""Now for the second happiest moment of my life... let's dig in!"" I had waited a year for this meal. Charmaine and I knew I deserved it. We deserved it.

We dug in, each starting with a leg. As I took my first bite, I reveled as the blood dripped from my mouth. My fangs tore the smooth flesh from the bone as my blood red eyes rolled to the back of my head. The band continued to play as the rest of the patrons continued with their meals, losing all manners, and making a bloody mess of the restaurant. ""Oh I love you, Charmain."" I said as my claws dug into the lump of flesh, blood, and bones laid before me. ""I love you too,"" replied Charmaine, drinking more of the blood from her wine glass.

We held hands and together spoke, ""To one more full year.""",shortscarystories

Rrrrrriiiiiinnnng.
Rrrrrriiiii-

I shut off my alarm as quickly as possible. The watch on my wrist read 3:00 AM. I thought it’d never come; it was finally Christmas. Unable to hold my excitement, I slowly stood up from my bed, and cautiously twisted the door handle that connected my room to the upstairs hallway. 

I live in a small house, in a quiet neighborhood, here in Canada. My sisters room is to the left of mine, and my mother’s is across. My father separated away from my family a relatively long time ago, so I don’t really consider him a part of my life anymore. Anyway, the silence that was slithering throughout the pitch black void was broken by a loud crash downstairs. Knowing that my family would be awakened by the mysterious sound, I closed my door and stayed inside my cozy room for another few minutes. I didn’t hear any movement upstairs, and decided to finally leave my room. As I closed the door behind me, I started hearing glass bells ringing. Like, cheerful ones, those embodied in a holiday spirit.

I couldn’t believe it. As a 10 year old boy, who’s about to retrieve gifts for myself, I would be finding Santa delivering the presents to me as well! 

Knowing he would be a welcoming spirit, I stopped caring about what sounds I made and cheerfully galloped down the stairs, into the living room, where I was greeted with the scent of pine from my decorative Christmas tree, which’s lights were lightly flickering to ease the atmosphere. Then, I saw a man, with a red suit hunched over the tree wrapping up presents. I stared at him, while making my way towards him. I just couldn’t keep my happiness from spilling out of the cup!

And then I stopped dead in my tracks.

He whispered muffled sounds under his breath, and then turned his head 720 degrees. Yes, he turned his head twice, around itself, as if it was adjusting to something. He locked his eyes onto me. His bloodshot red eyes, with a smile so wide it went off his face, was greeted by my naive “hello.” I shouldn’t have spoke to him. He screamed, onto the top of lungs “HELLO!!!”. And then, he stood up. He was so tall, that his chest reached the top of the ceiling, leaving his neck hunched over. He started frantically laughing and jumping around my living room, destroying almost every piece of furniture that remained. I got hit by his longated arm, that had me flying against the wall. As my eyes started slowly fading into the blackness, I saw him walk towards me. Similar to a centipede. His face got really close to mine, and I could smell a sharp iron scent; blood. Hearing footsteps from upstairs, the creature calmly whispered the last statement I heard before passing out. 

“you were a bad kid. and I ran out of coal.”",shortscarystories
"Danny was gripping both sides of the sink, sweat dripping profusely from his face, the sick smell of bile fresh in the air. 

Still heaving, he looked nervously at the bloodshot eyes which stared back at him. He felt the bile surging once again up his throat as he thought over his plans for the day: 

He was going to kill his best friend. 

Danny and Jeremy knew each other for as long as they could remember. They took turns doing everything together; classes, sports, video games, homework, everything. Danny just couldnt imagine Jeremy not by his side. Which made the fact that Katy liked Jeremy even worse. He knew Danny liked her, too. And he decided to kiss her anyways. 

That was why Jeremy had to die. 

Snapping out of his reverie, Danny noticed the array of small pill bottles on the shelf and his mind went to the words of Dr. Dillard. ""Make sure to take 2 of these every day,"" the psychiatrist said. ""It'll help.""

Danny scoffed. It's been a week since he stopped taking his meds and he has never felt better. 

And his mind has never felt clearer.

Katy belonged with him, not Jeremy. So when his chance came -he fingered the blade in his wasteband with a nervous resolve- he would do it. 

Time seemed to crawl by while Danny waited. Impatient, he dozed off. 

Waking, he found that Jeremy was in the bathroom staring at the mirror. 

That was when Danny struck. ""You piece of shit!"" He screamed, his knife gliding across Jeremy's wrist. With a flourish, the knife then found itself in Jeremy's chest. 

With a gurgle, he flung himself backwards, his  momentum carrying him through the bathroom door in a cascade of splintered wood. The mirror fell from above the sink after the collision, shattering into a vast array of shards.

Looking into one of the glass shards on the floor, Danny saw Jeremy's blue eyes widen with shock, saw a spurt of blood leak from Jeremy's mouth and stain his orange and blue tshirt, saw the lifeblood pumping from the slit in Jeremy's wrist, saw the hilt of the knife peeking from Jeremy's chest.

Danny turned his own blue eyes away from the reflective piece of glass, sadness filling his heart. He felt dizzy. He looked at the blood-pumping slash across his wrist and the knife plunged to the hilt in his chest. He looked down at the spatter of blood on his orange and blue tshirt. His vision began fading to black as the pool of blood around himself widened. The last thing he noticed was the pill bottles prescribed by Dr. Dillard, knocked clear of their perch during the scuffle.

The labels read, ""For Dissociative Identity Disorder.""",shortscarystories
"At night Jody heard them calling to him. They writhed and squirmed; crept and crawled. They festered  in his thoughts as he lay awake in bed and in his dreams, when he finally slept. 

Especially when he slept. 

Behind closed eyes their whiskers tickled his nose, his cheek, his chin. Their squeaks echoed in his head. 

This went on for months. And yet, Jody did  nothing because he was afraid. He dared not go to them—not at night. And in the day, when he could bear the idea of confronting them, they were never there. 

He saw one scurrying across the basement floor once, in daylight and tried to grab it. He wasn’t fast enough though and it’s little pink tail wriggled under a stack of boxes...and it was gone. 

Jody knew that if he wanted to meet them it would have to be at night. And he knew he must meet them. He must because they called to him. Over and over. And the calling wouldn’t stop. It would never stop. It would go on and on, until he did something about it. 

Six months passed. Jody couldn’t bear it any longer.   He slid out of bed, skipped his slippers and walked barefoot instead. He made his way down stairs to the cellar door. 

The door was closed. It creaked as he opened it. And it must’ve startled them because for a brief moment they stopped scurrying about. But only for a brief moment. 

Each step into the darkness felt like one step closer to his....destiny? Doom? 

As his eyes adjusted to the dark, he saw their beady black pea-eyes looking at him—sizing him up. Their noses twitched impatiently and they called to him. Their tiny voices called him closer.  

And he obliged. 

Whiskers brushed against his toes. He felt them crawling over his feet. They climbed his leg, their little padded feet cool against his warm skin. 

Inside his head, the voices—hundreds of them—became one. One rat voice that spoke clear in his mind. 

“Behold, the Rat King.” 

Furry bodies swarmed him, encircled him like a rodent cyclone. He opened his mouth to scream but nothing came out. The space was quickly filled by a curious rat. 

Jody fell to the ground, covered in a heap of fur and tails. 

There he slept, for the first time in a long time, and in his dreams he wasn’t Jody, the human. 

His vision changed. Everything looked a little bigger than it used to. And that’s not all. His sense of smell sharpened. He wanted scraps...cheese...flesh. 

Then, Jody realized the dream wasn’t  a dream. He looked down on the throne of garbage he sat upon. A shoe to be exact. A bottle cap—his crown. He looked at his worshippers—with their beady black eyes as they chanted: “Behold, the Rat King.”",shortscarystories
"I didn’t do it. It wasn’t me. Someone else killed and canned Pat. I’m just eating him. Now to be fair, I didn’t know it was Pat at first. Pat was in a Spam can so you can see where I might have slipped up. On closer inspection after cooking my meal I realized there was a strange handmade label on the can of supposed Spam. It said Homecut Pat. And that’s that. No reason to waste my perfectly fine meal of canned Pat and toast I supposed.

It might have been Veronica if that’s what you want to know. She’s the one I bought it from. She had some extra canned food she didn’t need so I took them off her hands. I don’t know why she’d think I wanted to eat canned Pat but I appreciate the thought I guess. He didn’t taste too bad in all honesty. There was only one can though or I’d offer to fry some up for you.

Pat was a little fat so I’m sure sweet old Veronica might have some more to spare if that’s what you’re looking for. She sure did have a lot of cans to give me and for such a fair price I must say. I think I’ll try the canned Sam next.",shortscarystories

All I know is Santa must be a very good man, making presents for all the children of the world. Mummy and Daddy say Santa has elves that work for him to make all the toys, the elves must work very hard to make all those presents in time.

On Christmas Day, Mummy and Daddy put me to bed and I was so excited to see Santa. My eyes felt so heavy and I fell asleep with ease. 

I woke up suddenly. I was being picked up, it was dark so I couldn't see what was happening - 'I think it's Santa' I thought to myself. I fell back asleep in his arms, knowing he was taking me to see the elves.

-

It's been 3 years since I've been here. Santa's Grotto isn't a happy place, the man who forces us to work says Santa won't be happy if we get behind. I want to know why Santa has taken me? I want to know why my parents would let a man into our house who does this to children? I don't know whether I'll ever get out of here. Until then I'm one of Santa's little helpers. 

Merry Christmas.",shortscarystories
"I read about it in a discarded newspaper I found blown against the windowsill from the city streets below. I got out of bed, and typed in the address to have myself a laugh: thispersondoesnotexist.com.

I barely understand how it works, but essentially, a computer algorithm seamlessly combines features from several different people’s faces and creates an altogether new person who, as the address states, does not exist.

I noted a few distinctive features on some of them – Barack Obama’s hair, John Green’s eyes (and eyeglasses),  Susan Boyle’s chins, etc. But somehow, each composite face registered as an altogether new person in my brain, one I’d never seen before, and all of them looked entirely real.

“Hey mom!” I called. “Come check this out!”

I heard her groan from the next room, irritated, fully anticipating a waste of twenty steps.

I kept refreshing the page to create new results, giggling to myself.

But suddenly, I was not laughing any more.

“What, son, is so funny?” my mother asked from the doorway, her voice creaky and strained. Almost robotic.

“Don’t worry about it,” I answered, trying my best to stay calm.

I didn’t dare to look up, silently hoping she would just leave without investigating further.

“Show me, son, what it is that you are looking at,” she said, scooping up the mouse to prevent me from clicking away.

My mother’s face was on the screen.

But her face was no longer on her face.",shortscarystories
"My wife, of 13 years, passed away September 9, 2001. The cancer slowly ate her alive and I had to sit back and watch it leach off of my reason to live. God was merciless but she fought every step of the way. Some part of me registered the resigned look in her eyes towards the end but it didn't make anything easier. 

I would of ended it right then if TMT hadn't gotten ahold of me the next day. At first I figured they were another blood thirsty bill collector but the odd voice on the end of the line cleared that up right away. It told me what TMT stood for, in a genderless tone, and what I had to do. My first reaction to the call was disgusted anger and disbelief but my desperation got the better of me.

My instructions were to text a clear and simple wish to the 800 number provided, pretty simple. Once the message was carefully worded and double checked for spelling errors, I sent it. After that, I felt the urge to laughed at myself for believing in the stupidy of it all. My wish was just that, a want for something that cannot happen. 

The next morning was worst than the first. As soon as my brain was able to comprehend thought, she came to mind; accompanied by a terrible emptiness. Muted murmurs from the 11am news filled room and the familiar sensation of tears greeted my cheeks when I sat up in bed. 

""Oh good you're up, look what's happening in New York!""

My heart dropped to my toes and my head whipped around at a break neck pace.  My vision fell upon one of the most amazing sites of my life. She sat there in her silky grey pajamas with a sullen look fixed on her face. I attempted to ask how she was even there but a stutter caught the words in my throat.

""Those famous towers collapsed a little bit ago. So many are dead. I mean, Can you imagine? All those poor people..."" She changed the channel as if for emphasis.

Before I could even put two and two together, a new message lit up my phone. 

""Your request has been completed. Thank you for using TradeMeTragedies.""",shortscarystories
"It's amazing how much you'll put up with when you're tired. 

Take Jennifer, for example. She had been up 34.5 hours. She was unable to go to sleep the night before, what with her upstairs neighbors banging and blaring till six in the morning. 

Her eyelids felt heavy as she drove along the winding roads leading to her complex..

A minivan cut her off. Normally, Jennifer would raise her right finger and fall on her horn. Without sleep, however, she was apathetic.  

The only saving grace was the thought that as soon as she got to the door, her parents would buzz her in, and she could crash in her downy bed.

Five minutes and one instance of slamming on the brakes so as not to hit a pedestrian later and Jennifer had found her way to the outside door of her building. Finally. With a sigh of relief, Jennifer pressed the buzzer for apartment 6.

No answer. Wait a moment.

Buzz. Wait. No answer. 

Ping. A small twinkle of sound chimed from Jennifer's purse as confusion knit her brows together. She sifted through the old fast food receipts and random makeup products to find her phone. She pressed the buzzer again distractedly. 

A text. Mom.

"

The snow covered the window panes with sinister insistence. Derek was waiting under the covers for the arrival of something dark. His child's heart sensed the approach of a nightmare. It was the Krampusnacht and he was suddenly home alone. Some kind of spell had plunged his parents and siblings into a dream. Although they were physically there, they were not for Derek. He knew that that year, like the previous one, he had not behaved well. He knew he had a pending debt since last year with the monster. Both had seen each other before.

Last time, Krampus did not do very well, despite the fear he projected on the child, a mysterious malice that came from him left him perplexed. The monster still felt the burning of the burning coal above his right eye. The last time that demon had failed in his mission to take him to hell and devour him. Now he could not fail. 

«Is it him? Is it coming? ”Derek wondered while he heard the faint sound of the cowbell peeking out and gradually became more palpable near the fireplace. He sweated despite the winter. He felt for a moment a rare paralysis that, like his relatives, tried to plunge him into a mysterious dream; but he was strong and something in his soul resisted the spell and remained awake. Now the shadow steps were crawling up the stairs as a threat. His heart pounded in his chest like a drum. He felt the cold run through his body. The sound of the door handle immediately gave way to horror. The boy already felt in his room the thick shadow of the devil. The sound of the cowbell in the darkness puzzled him. He knew that soon that shadow would loom over his bed and collect his debt.

""I'm here, kid ... Are you afraid?"" The thing whispered, poking out his horns over his face. Last time you were a very bad boy. You will not get away with it again. 

The boy could never have felt such a terrible fear, even in his first encounter with that Christmas demon. Krampus's eyes lit up with a liquid fire, as if hell projected through them claiming Derek's soul. The boy looked pale under his eyes. He remained motionless and uttered no words. Despite his fear, Derek was prepared for his encounter with the beast. Under the sheets, he held a knife in one hand, and without hesitation as the demon leaned over him, he stuck it in his chest through his heart. Krampus let out a terrible cry of pain that woke the inhabitants of the house. Derek felt something warm like blood on his body as the demon disappeared into an explosion of darkness.

Krampus realized that the Christmas ghosts were nothing more than shadows of dreams, in the Derek’s darkness.",shortscarystories
"I wake up in my bed feeling a little hungover. When did I even go to sleep?

It’s the 25th of December, 12:34 pm. 

Why can't christmas be over already? 

This holiday really is my personal hell. I hate the stores, filled to the brink with masses of people. I hate the smells, the decoration, the music. So this year I decided to skip all of it. No tree, no presents, no jolly holiday spirit. I'm gonna spend the day with ordering food, watching netflix and drinking on my own.

Looking at the wintery scene outside, I almost feel content. That is until I get interrupted by the sound of music coming from downstairs.

*You better watch out, You better not cry*

What the hell. Is there someone in my house?

Heavy steps are making their way upstairs. I hold my breath. My heart is beating like crazy but then I think it could be my mum, she has a spare key. Burglars wouldn't turn on music, right?

That's when my door slams open. A rotten smell of sulfur mixed with eggnog and cinnamon hits my face, making me gag. In front of me I see a tall man... dressed like Santa Claus. Grey hair. Red suit. But everything about him looks a little off. His hair is long and greasy. The suit looks worn out and somehow wrong as if it melted and became part of his skin. He is staring at me and slowly forming his mouth to a gigantic smile showing off a set of rotten teeth. 

I'm freezing and sweating at the same time as I realize that there is no way to escape. He's blocking the door. I want to grab my phone but somehow I'm not able to look away from the insane look on his face. 

That's when he jumps over, pulling me to the ground with him. His eyes are filled with rage. The gruesome smile never leaving his face.

*Better not pout, I'm telling you why*

I try to fight. Free myself. But he grabs a massive knife out of his coat and slams it in my leg, then my arm, then my stomach. Blood is splashing everywhere. All I see is the colour red. 

*Santa Claus is coming to town*

He pulls the knife out once more. He's aiming for my chest and-

"Call me Eli.

My neighbors had a huge yard that we weren't allowed to cross. One day my friends and I were playing kickball and someone accidentally kicked it into their yard.

He ran to the fence seperating our yards. We heard two voices saying, ""You can cross only if you're wearing blue."" We were devastated knowing that Mark was colorblind and wasn't wearing blue. He leapt over the fence and was instantly letting out a bloodcurdling scream discovering that wolves were pouncing on him.

We watched in horror as the wolves were tearing him apart, the dark blood rising into the air and landing on our yard and some of our faces. The flesh was devoured in an instant, leaving bloody bones and two sightless eyes rolling toward the fence.

Last time this happened, a girl crossed even though her hair was short, and she fell into a hole, breaking her neck. Almost nobody crosses out of the yard of Adam, Stella, and Eli McGillicudy.",shortscarystories
"I can hear their breathing through the walls. Slow and deep, they are asleep. I am not. I cannot. I hear their breathing through the walls.

When I was young, my mother warned me of them. She warned me of their cold terrible hands. She warned of their poisons. She warned me to never let them catch me. They caught her. They killed her.

I learned to hide- to hide in the walls. They did not kill me, and- over the course of many years- I've grown. I am strong now. The blankets I sew cannot be broken.

Still I hear their breathing through the walls. They are insufferable to me. My eyes fill with hatred... and hunger. Terrible hunger. I hear their breathing through the walls.

But they sleep.

I crawl out of the hole in the wall. My legs are silent on the wood. I crawl to where they sleep up upon their beds. Their flesh is cold when I bite into it and release my venom. Their breath becomes haggard for a moment. Then, they fall silent.

Sweet beautiful silence.

"He begged him not to. He pleaded with him to get back inside, where it was warm and nice and not at all dangerous. Where it was safe. 

But it didn’t matter. Franky knew that he couldn’t change his mind. 

“We’ve already skipped this for way too long,” he said. “And your mother will be home any second. She expects the lights to be up.” 

Franky could only watch as Daryl climbed up the ladder, taking each creaky rung at a time. He held his breath. Blood rushed to his head. And with that came the paranoia, the knowledge that everything was going to be awful. 

He waited for the inevitable. The gust of wind that would send him flailing backwards. The frost he would find, sliding off his feet and off the roof. 

The scream. 

He couldn’t help himself. He made a wish. He wished for an interruption. He wished for an epiphany. 

Franky wished that something would stop—

—And then, just as his father had reached the middle rung, gloved hands tight around the icy sides, he vanished. He winked out of sight. Like someone had flipped a switch. 

The ladder swayed, fell sideways. Franky numbly stepped aside. It barely missed him. It hit the ground with a metallic clang.

"Have you ever found something in your life that defies explanation?

That despite your best efforts, just doesn’t make sense? And no amount of rationalization or examination gets you any closer to finding an answer. Just one day you wake up and notice something different, and nothing in your life’s ever the same.

That was what happened to Tim the day he found the hole. It was completely by accident, too—walking home from school, playing Candy Crush, he’d gone a block too far before he looked up and realized he was on the wrong street. But when he turned around, something out of the corner of his eye caught his attention. Something he wasn’t even sure he’d seen, but demanded further investigation.

It was over by a pair of shrubs at the last house on the left. There, in the middle of the ground, was a hole. Pitch black, completely innocuous. But something about it filled Tim with dread. He glanced around. No one in sight. He stepped closer.

The hole wasn’t too big, maybe a foot in diameter, but he couldn’t see anything inside of it. Plus, the closer he got, the more uneasy Tim became, until he was standing directly in front of the thing, his heart pounding and sweat dripping off his brow. He paused. A part of him wanted to reach his hand inside, but a deeper part screamed against it.

Looking around, Tim picked up a rock and tossed it softly in. Nothing. No sound of impact, or even an indication of the thing falling. Just one second the stone was in the air, and the next it was...gone.

Frowning, Tim picked up another rock and tossed it in. Same result—dead silence. A car passed by slowly behind him, shaking him out of his confusion, so Tim turned around and went back home. But the whole way back, he continued to think of the hole.

What was down there? How far did it extend? Was something at the other end? These were the thoughts that consumed Tim at dinner that night, and were the reason why he feigned exhaustion and went to bed early so he could sneak out with the remaining leftovers of that evening’s lasagna.

Standing in the dark at the foot of the hole, Tim shivered. It wasn’t even too late, yet the streetlight for this corner wasn’t working, leaving only the moon above to guide his hand. Gulping, Tim stepped forward and tossed the plate in.

Silence. Tim didn’t know what it meant, but he knew it wasn’t enough. There had to be something more he could give it. Something that would fill the hole.

As the weeks went by, more and more missing pet posters littered the town. The butcher shop began keeping lookouts for whoever kept breaking in. People started to lock their doors at night after the posters looking for Tim made their way around town. But he was gone—into the hole and into the darkness.",shortscarystories
"There are two ways that a Christmas tree fairy fails to light up. Either there’s no power, or the light fixture itself is not working. I found a third way. 
	
The kids had noticed that it was not lighting up from time to time. So I eventually took it down to my basement. And I spent longer and longer down there each day. You see, what I discovered is that wherever there is a Christmas tree fairy that lights up, there is a fairy portal. A fairy comes through and materializes into a human looking for love.
	
The fairy light went out. My beautiful fairy appeared. She was perfect. Her body had a natural hourglass figure, she was tingling with femininity. The butterflies fluttered in my stomach every time she stood before me, naked.
	
And then, bang! The back of her head exploded, and the fairy light flickered like crazy. She continued to walk slowly towards me, raising her arms as if to embrace me. Blood oozed from her eyes, nose and mouth. Her mouth opened. Her lower jaw fell open, and then dropped to the floor. Her tongue flopped out in front of her neck. I screamed like a girl. I was sitting on a chair, legs still parted, when she fell down dead. Her gaping mouth landed on my crotch, and in my lap was a half-skull bowl filled with mangled brain and tissue. I turned around.

When i was longing for my parents, he would just caress my hair and say, ""shh,"" with a stone-cold look, ""it's for the good for our relationship. You know i love you.""

I couldn't cry, because i knew what would happen when he gets angry.

One day, when i was watching a video on my phone, he thought that i was cheating on him, just because i giggled. He took my phone and never gave it back. 

That night when i was crying because of my bruises, he just said ""you know i love you. you know i'm the best for you. and i'm enough for you.""

He called these 'love'.

"*Thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk.*

My feet echoed across the darkened hall as I ran like a maniac. My desperation had reached astronomical levels.

*Where was the way out?*

Sprinting as far as my legs could take me, I took many twists and turns, making my way through the wreckage and fresh corpses. I knew this place, all of its ins and outs, but for some reason, I couldn’t remember. Was it because of my anxiety?

There was no time to ponder. I had to escape if I wanted to survive. I was too young to die.

Now, was it to my left, or right? Was it behind me? Forward? Was it East or West? Or, was it... was it...

I collapsed. My whole body ached. I was sweating bullets. It felt like I was melting.

I couldn’t run any farther. I was so exhausted.

The realization came to me.

I would die here.

Scared.

No one at my side.

Forgotten.

There was no point.

There was no...

I remained suspended in the air, gasping for breath as an invisible force gradually closed my windpipe.

I turned around, not by my own hand.

Six white figures appeared from the blackness, staring at me with soulless glass eyes.

I heard heavy footsteps. They were growing louder.

There emerged a shadow, walking closer to me.

‘Another nightmare, wasn’t it?’

I look around the room. My heart is pounding like crazy. I see a dark figure sitting on the edge of my bed. Am I having another bad dream? Maybe I never woke up?

‘You *are* awake, Oliver,’ says the stranger, as if he could read my thoughts.

‘W-who are you?’ I ask, trying to control my trembling voice.

The shadow moves a little closer. 

I squeeze Mr. Bunny to cheer myself up a bit.

‘I’m Death,’ replies the figure.

‘D-death?’ I stutter. ‘A-are you going to…?’

‘Take you away? Not until you want me to,’ says Death. 

I’m confused.

‘Why would I ever want to die?’ I ask, surprised.

‘Oh, Oliver… You’re nine. Of course you don’t want to die. But I think you’re very sad sometimes, aren’t you?’

I look at my sore hands. There’s a lot of small bruises left by IV catheters. 

‘Mom says it’s okay to be sad. Or cry. Even adults cry,’ I respond bravely.

‘Your mom cries a lot, am I right?’

I say nothing. I’m scared he knows so much.

Death breaks the silence and asks, ‘Oliver, what if I told you there’s a place where you can play with other kids? The place where you don’t have to take medications?’

I frown. ‘You’re lying. There’s no such place. I can’t leave hospital.’

‘I can show you. You wouldn’t feel pain anymore… your hair would start growing back…’

I gently touch the skin on my head. I kinda miss my hair. And being, uh, normal. But…

‘What about mom and dad?’ I ask, troubled. ‘Are they gonna be there with me?’

‘No, but they will join you one day, I promise.’

‘Pinky promise?’

‘Pinky promise,’ Death nods, serious.

I take a deep, wheezy breath. ‘Fine, I’ll go with you.’

The dark shadow comes closer. ‘Don’t be scared, it’ll only hurt for a moment.’

Before I say anything, I feel something heavy on my chest. I try to fight it but I’m too weak.

Sharp pain spreads across my lungs and...

The heart rate monitor releases a steady, high-pitched noise.

I don’t feel pain anymore.

I’m free.

‘Mr. Welkins,’ she says with a hushed voice, ‘your son has just passed away. I am very sorry...’

The man looks deeply into her eyes, tears rolling down his cheeks.

Last month a man attacked a woman with a knife. Everybody was scared, or so it seemed. But not me. I defended the woman and neutralized the man with difficulty. I was barely injured, and I became the hero of the town. But that didn't change anything about my family and how I treated them.

Last night Leah started screaming at me. She asked for divorce. I refused because I have to do what Cynthia says. Leah was angry because I don't bear lust or love. She said the marriage has failed badly. She said she's taking the kids too. I said we should go slow. After that, Cynthia faded away for some time. Without her orders it felt like I had no purpose.

This morning I took Sarah to the park, thinking it wouldn't break any rules. After playing for a while, she fell from the swing and her head hit a hard rock. I couldn't care less when she bled to death, grieving and shrieking.

I came back home, feeling danger to some extent for the first time ever. But Leah wasn't home. I went back to the park.

Once Cynthia came back and learned what happened, she said that I'm dangerous for humanity. How is that possible? I'm a human too. She isn't.

That was the first time I ever felt curious, and it was overwhelming. Somebody please locate me and end my life. I'm still sitting right next to my daughter's lifeless body in the park no one visits.

That night she startled awake. It took her a few seconds to realise that it was the smoke that had woken her. The smell had become part of life the last week but now it was stronger. Suffocating the room. When she looked out the window she could see the glow of the flames coming closer. 

She didn’t know what else to do. She scooped up the baby and got the big woolen blanket her mother had knitted for her. She filled the bath with cold water and soaked the blanket. The smoke was getting thicker as she climbed into the bath, the baby on her chest and the blanket over them both. She could hear the wood of the porch burning and cracking. 

She prayed for a miracle. For the firemen to come. For her husband to come. For the wind to change. Anything but this. It was getting warmer and the fire was creeping closer.

Suddenly Zizi heard voices and started running, her little sandals clapping away on the linoleum flooring.

""HEY YOU, STOP!"" A man shouted, giving chase.

Zizi turned a corner to find another hallway. Panicking she opened one of the doors and hid inside. The dark office, illuminated by the gleam of a computer screen, offered her little refuge forcing her to hide under the desk itself.

The door suddenly opened, a radio chattering.

""Yeah, alright. I know. I'm looking for her. Who the hell left the cage open anyway? Was it Sam?""

The man stepped back outside, closing the door. Zizi let herself breathe. She crawled out from under the desk and crept over to the door. Opening it slightly, she saw the man on the radio talking to someone else.

""You had one simple job to do.""

""It was an accident, okay. These brats are always causing trouble. Look I'm sorry. Look let's just find her before someone notices.""

""You better hope no one finds out. She's being taken in the morning.""

Zizi wanted to cry, wanted to be with her mother and father more than anything. But she told herself only little children cried and she had to be strong.

The men walked down the hall and after a few moments Zizi opened the door, running in the other direction. Hall after hall of fluorescent nothingness passed her by until at last she saw a door marked EXIT in green lights. Zizi knew the word from television. It meant outside. Zizi hadn't seen the sun in weeks. She ran as fast as her little legs would carry her to the barred doorway between her and the exit. She tried to open the gate but it wouldn't.

""There you are.""

Zizi turned around, terrified. The man was with the radio blocked the only way back.

""It's okay, I'm just going to take you back."" He made a shushing sound as he walked towards her with his arms open.

The man carried Zizi back down the hallway to her cage, a small cell with a mat and reflective blanket on a concrete floor. Zizi wept as the door closed.

""You found her!"" The second man had arrived.

""No thanks to you. Get on the phone with ICE and find out what time their arriving tomorrow.""

The men walked away.

Zizi curled up into a ball and covered her ears, desperate to drown out the cries of all the other children around her.",shortscarystories
"The living always think death is the end, the cessation of responsibilities, stress and work. They couldn’t be further from the truth. 

I guess I have a modest job for a dead guy. I’m not sure if it’s punishment or reward for how I lived, it’s just my job. I’m not sure what happens if I fail. I’ve been led to believe that it will redefine terror.

My job is simple, making the livings’ life more difficult. Not all of them, just ones I’m assigned. I’ve been told the purpose is that; “Life isn’t enriching when things are too easy” or some other idealistic mission statement crap like that.  

Most of what I do is straightforward. Deleting files right before their work is complete, draining the batteries in cars and devices. Just simple frustrating things to cause challenge in their peaceful existence. Occasionally, I’ll get tasked with a big one. Cancer or car accident is usually my go-to in these cases.

It was a simple job, until I was assigned Isabel. I threw everything I could at disrupting this optimistic, perky, always smiling, skipping through the challenges, woman. 

Nothing, and I mean nothing, throws her off her blind optimism and it’s making me sick. I’ve taken her family, friends, given her strange diseases, every time she meets it with a smile and confidence. 

I’m not sure what happens if I fail, but I’m afraid I’m going to find out.

Usually I can’t see everything my target does, I’m assigned multiple people at a time. This one is personal now; Isabel must be made to falter. I’ve been slowly influencing her life in a positive direction. Thinking that she’s positive because things never were great for her; therefore, loss has no impact.

I used every resource from romance stories I can think of, setting this up over months. She’s deeply in love, he quickly became her world. I’ve used more positive influence than I am permitted to get them here. A romantic holiday in a secluded getaway, dinner for two, cushions set in front of a crackling fire, cuddling and exploring their love.

It couldn’t be more perfect. Her eyes are sparkling, locked with his, I’ve never seen love this intense in the eyes. She’s unaware that I’ve chosen him due to his heart defect. One flick of my finger through his chest and boom… This will devastate her…

I focus on patience, nervously pacing the room. I must let the passion build to a peak before I take him. I’m already on thin ice.

From the corner of my eye, movement, a glint, something shiny. I turn quickly rushing to them… It’s too late. Isabel plunged the knife directly through his heart. Staring deeply into his eyes, watching the last bit of his life drain. She’s so damn insanely happy.

I scramble to come up with a plan or explanation. I can see myself dissolving already… 

I’m not sure what will happen because I failed, but I’m terrified.",shortscarystories
"When I first found Belle, I knew she was the one. She had the most perfect fingernails I had ever seen. I didn't have to look down to see the ugliness of my own- jagged and tough from years of a biting fixation. As she walked to her car, looking down at her phone, I saw my chance. I came up behind her with my sweetly-scented washcloth and stole her away. She was the easiest one yet.

She screamed when she first saw me. I know it was out of shock, I am a very pretty woman. My nose, the perfect button. My lips, so supple and soft. As if the Lord himself had taken the perfect features and created me. I whistled as I took Belle's fingers to the cutting board, being careful as to not chip my fingernails. I started with my left hand, and chewed on my old finger as I stitched on my new ones.",shortscarystories

"I yawned as I browsed through Reddit at 1:03 AM in the darkness of my room. The lights were switched off and the curtains were closed. I should have been asleep hours ago so that I could be energetic for tomorrow's taxing day at the office. At 1:17 AM I finally made the sensible choice and locked my phone and put it on my bedside table, almost knocking over the lamp placed on it.

At 2:03 AM, I woke up to the faint pit-pat of my dog, Tintin, walking up to my bed. He climbed up on the bed and laid down between my legs. Half asleep, I reached down to pet him, stroking his fur. It felt a bit weird, the texture. As if he had been playing in the sand all day. Groaning, I made a mental note to myself to give Tintin a bath the next day and clean my bedsheets. I slowly drifted off to sleep, comforted by the familiar weight of Tintin on my legs.

My alarm jolted me awake at 8:00 AM and I groaned to myself. I felt so tired. I felt as if I had been running for five hours straight instead of being asleep. I got up and rubbed the sleep from my eyes. Tintin had made quite a mess on my bedsheets. There was dirt everywhere. I sighed as I got up and threw the bedsheets into the laundry basket. I walked up to my bedside table to get my phone. Just as I reached out for it, I noticed that Tintin's collar was right beside my phone. I stood there for five minutes, memories flooding into my tired brain. Adrenalin started pumping through me, getting rid of my tiredness. I grabbed the collar and ran outside to my backyard. I put the collar back in the box with poor Tintin and carried the box back towards the hole I had to dig out two years ago. I gently put the box inside the hole and reburied it. I replanted the flowers on my best friend's grave and ran back to the house. I took my suitcase and filled it with as many clothes I could fit in it. On the way to the door leading to the garage, I stopped and looked back. ""Goodbye Tintin"", I thought to myself.

I entered the garage, got into my hand me down Toyota and drove off. I never looked back.",shortscarystories
"She sat at her desk looking prettier than ever, She looks great in that skirt, She got up once the bell rang and I followed her, She walked out of school still holding her textbooks, She speedily walked down the street, She stopped and looked at me so I smiled, She looked scared, She backed away from me, She backed up into a tree so I grabbed her, She wiggled and squirmed trying to escape my grip, She couldn't escape me, She watched me as I pulled her down the stairs to my basement, She didn't have the skirt on much longer, She screamed, She watched me as I removed her body parts, She scremed even more, She won't be seen again.",shortscarystories
"The Summoner's eyes burned into me like a welder's torch. I keep my head down, breathing deep and trying to not let it bother me. I've been here before. I'm used to this. He folds out a gnarly hand into which I carefully place the name of my subject. ""Emily...Bruce,"" his voice like the rattling of rusted metal against my eardrum.

I nod sharply, hoping, praying that this time, after eight solid years of trial, he accepts. And so he does.

""Follow,"" he orders, ushering me through what seems an endless labyrinth of corridors, all cloaked in a darkness much heavier than I have known. At some point, I know that I will cross the threshold; the barrier between this world and the next. 

At some point I know that I will lose the precious ability to turn back; to change my mind...which I won't. And at some point, aeons later, we stopped. I felt the texture of the earth grow soft. I felt the freshness of southern wind against my cheeks. Before me, wrapped in the eerie translucence of ethereal fog, stood a window suspended by nothing. My heart fluttered as I peered through the blades of glass. 

On the other side was all that was left of Emily Bruce, the girl I loved before life took its turn for the worst. Before the grip of death would tear us both apart. I look with pity upon her ghastly figure drifting through the bedroom. It's been eight years. Eight terrible years of wishing that she could somehow escape. Of wishing that she could find a way to tell me how unhappy she was on the other side. Of wishing that we could be together again - though we never will.

""Call out to her,"" the Summoner says. ""The window is clear. The time has come. All that's needed now is a hook."" With that, I press my face against the window, and through an endless buzz of static I scream her name. I watch her gasp and turn right towards me, her face a lifeless concoction of grief, resentment and abandoned hope. I watch her withered lips take the quivering shape of my name.

I watch her crawl towards me, reaching out in desperation with arms bearing hundreds of blade-edge tattoos. And finally I watch as the Summoner stretches a spectral arm through the window, snatching her by the neck and burying his claws into the festering wound that became of her soul. The last thing I hear before his smoldering eyes would eclipse hers is an almost gleefully sinister ""Thank you.""

My heart sank as I realized how terribly wrong I had been for all this time. It was never about the Channeling...it was about  the Taking.",shortscarystories
" 

Well before the comfort of electric lights a man was walking through the woods, coming home from a pub.  He was inebriated but the woods were well known to the drunkard and he never bothered to light a lantern.

Not far into his trek near Smith Farm, he was struck with an unnerving feeling that someone was watching him.  He looked around fervently while silently cursing himself for not bringing a torch.  He could see very little other than shadows against even darker shadows.  Then there was a rustling from a tree branch above.

He slowly turned his head towards the noise.  He could just make out the silhouette of what appeared to be thin fingers and boney knuckles wrapped around a branch about ten feet in the air.  Hovering just below the branch were two glowing eyes the color of rust. Frightened, he cried out loudly.

The luminous circles shifted in tandem after the man.  He began to withdraw when his foot caught a root, landing him on his ass and knocking the wind out of him.  A shock-wave ran through him and his vision lit up for a split second; he could see the full shape of the beast.  

Both of its arms outstretched in the air gripping branches. Its head, oblong with 2 horns protruding from it.  

The night's merriment had finally caught up to him and his surroundings began to swirl and distort.  The luminous eyes began to shift left and right,  all the while bobbing up and down. The man could hear the branches rustle and assumed it had loosened its grip to attack.

His trembling hand clumsily grasped for the hilt causing him to lose sight of the diabolical creature in the darkness. Finally, he jerked the blade from its worn leather sheath, wielding it low to avoid a glint of moonlight.

Suddenly, he heard heavy hooves trampling the forest floor towards him.  Every muscle in his body tensed as he pulled himself to a squatting position. His body a coiled spring ready to thrust the blade.  

Crack!

A twig snapped directly behind him. He turned, lunged and stabbed in one motion.  He could feel the knife sink to the hilt and the warmth of blood on his cold hands. The beast shrieked. He immediately pulled back the knife and thrust it forward several times as he pummeled the convulsing body to the ground.

A truly brief moment of relief overcame him and as his drunken wit recovered, his pulse hastened and panic returned. A man in overalls, soaked in blood,  clutching a torch lay beneath him.  A farmhand heard him scream and came to help, only to pay for it with his life. 

He rolled off the lifeless body sprawled on the sodden forest floor in disbelief. At last, the ghoulish beast was illuminated atop its throne of branches, twas nothing more than an owl resting, draped in dangling vines.  The owl took flight as his horror and sorrow set in.",shortscarystories
"Natural resources ran out hundreds of years ago, weaseling out the few precious remaining food scraps and meat in just a few years. The pollution rotted the planet to the core, forcing us to move underground for safety. The population has slowly whittled away, either by disease, lack of food, force, or choice. In an authoritarian regime with vast experience on their side, dissent is the least of their worries. Their control of the people has turned into a well oiled machine. They have total control of the peasants. The government chooses what they eat, where they live, and if they wanted to, what time they shit. Those who act out are made into an example.

The only food supply left is lab grown, and with an unreliable dwindling electricity supply, it is not something to be impressed by. As rations become harder to obtain and produce, the people become more desperate, while the government begins to figure out ways to let some people go hungry. At first, they start to deny people rations who are just a few minutes late for a meal, but the brutality of their tactics rapidly increases along with their desperation. Those who try to steal rations face hard punishment. It began as public executions, swiftly done by guillotine or hanging. They expected the people to live in hunger out of fear, but they refused. So they had to come up with a fate worse than death.

Criminals and dissidents are knocked out, their organs removed one by one. Blood is extracted into little baggies connected through artificial veins. With their heart still beating, their kidneys and liver still filtering their blood, and their brain still intact, they become the perfect machine. They turn boneless, nerveless, skinless, and are given occasional liquid doses of nutrients. The ensemble of organs and machinery is propped up on a thick glass display case for all to see, neatly laid out along a wall in the town square. From that point on, they are destined to live in solitude, with nothing to accompany them except their thoughts until they somehow die.

I figured humanity would have withered out by now, pardoning me with death as an escape. It's hard to tell the passing of time, and my waking hours fade to dreams to the point where I can no longer tell them apart. I made no attempt to steal any rations, but they know that. With them being in charge of all of humanity in such a dire situation, it’s hard to blame them. Over the years, my organs have grown weak, leaving my body to be slowly replaced piece by piece. I went under as my heart was nearing its end, only to find it to be swapped with a perfect iron replacement as I woke up. My soul grows weaker, as I know there is no escape. As the years go on, one thing becomes certain. I should have killed myself when I had the chance.",shortscarystories
" 

I watched through the security cameras as the people walked through the 2,5 thick steel doors.

They were nervous, and they had every right to be.

Only half a day ago the apocalypse had begun. 

China had launched missiles and the United States responded with equal force.

Russia was soon drawn into the conflict and sided with China while the EU tried to remain neutral.

They wouldn’t stay that way though as it was obvious they had to choose a side.

Another family appeared on the monitor, a grown man with three children. Some of the children had burn marks but they seemed mostly alright.

The fact that the children were healthy put me at ease, children were now the most important thing in the world.

It wouldn’t be too long before Rusia fired its own Nuclear missiles now Moscow was a burning pile of ash.

Just like New York and several other cities at the coast.

A Doomsday preper, that was what they called me.

People who build bunkers, preparing for the worst.

And the worst had come.

The Redland Bunker. 

My personal pet project and pride.

The Redland Bunker had cost me multiple years to build and it emptied my wallet several times but now Nations all over the world were nothing more than nuclear waste I could only pat myself on the shoulder.

It was built in the middle of Kansas, far away from most major cities.

I estimated that it would take around 1 day before all the nations began using their “best” missiles.

The End of the World Missiles.

Luckily I and 82 other people would be long gone, hiding underneath miles of dirt and walls of steel.

Even Radiation wouldn’t break through it.

And the following Nuclear Winter wouldn’t really affect me.

As I watched the relieved smiles of the people inside my Bunker I could only smile.

It was not out of gratitude that I let them enter the Bunker.

It was only logical, they had to work for their stay and they would contribute to the survival of mankind.

I closed the steel doors of the Redland Bunker with one push of the button when I read that another missile was heading towards the United States.

My final problem was finally solved.

I would survive.

And the 82 people who had entered the Bunker would help me.

And if they died, their children would contribute.

I would never run out of food with this many people.",shortscarystories
"I hate myself.

I was always a daydreamer, and dreamt of success and fame. I had high hopes of myself, and frequently set impossible goals to push myself further. Except I never really worked to achieve those goals.

My parents were kind, amazing people who had always helped me, supported me and trusted me. They didn't deserve me, when I lied about studying while watching YouTube videos. They didn't deserve my when I smoked a cigarette for the first time. They didn't deserve me when I stole a considerable amount of money from my father's wallet, blaming it on the servant. 
I really tried to stop, but it was too late. My addiction had spiraled out of control, and I was desperate for someone to just end it all. 

So I prayed. Alot. Every day in the morning, every night before sleeping for someone, something to rid my suffering. And one day, it got answered.

I wasn't scared when I saw her, gliding over the stairs following me as I went into my bedroom.

I wasn't scared, when she drew her scythe out her robes making direct eye contact with me.

I wasn't scared, as I breathed a sigh of relief, ready for Death to take me away. 

I was scared, when she skipped past my room and entered my parents instead.",shortscarystories
"The ashes of the dead fill the air and choke my lungs. I can’t seem to get a decent breath. I can’t help but cough until I’ve expelled the polluted air from my lungs, but then I’m left drowning in the blood from being torn up inside. You wouldn’t think I could, but I’ve gotten used to it. This pain in my throat is killing me. 

I can’t see beyond the ashen fog that has engulfed this hellish landscape. It strains my eyes to see, but I can still make out the scorch marks of those who lived here. Women. Children. Cats and Dogs. Its hard to tell but I can see their souls seared to the ground. They reach out to me, crying, wailing, screaming, and moaning. They only ask why, but how can I answer such a question when my intent could not fathom the end result? 

No matter where I turn in this grey waste, I am continuously followed by a small child. I’ve asked the little boy so many times where to go, but he can only point to the distance where I can see clearly, a rotund, fat boy. These two come and go like a flash of blinding light. One moment, they’re here, the next, they’re gone. The thunderous roar that they bring is only deafened by the silence that they leave behind.

But something new has come along, in my darkest nightmare. A frail old man who leans on his heavy scythe. I feel nothing but impending doom when I approach this spectre, but what else can I do? I can’t gather enough resolve to look the apparition in the eye. I could only feel the weight of my own actions pull me to my knees. The scythe of the man fell before me, and he was gone just like the boys. I studied the implement, reaching for it slowly. As my hand was but an atoms width from its figure, it changed into a more familiar form. A notebook.

As I stand, alone, in this graveyard that is my home, my only company is both my biggest accomplishment and biggest mistake. It was my notes from the Manhattan Project. As I open the book to relish in my regret, I see only one sentence.

I am become death.",shortscarystories

It was not because a few days ago a new site named “Deathdatelist.org” appeared out of nowhere.

"The first few years, the extra disappearances slipped under the radar.

An increase by 10%? Noticeable, but still well within the normal bounds for missing persons. Oh, it was a tragedy for the families, of course. All very heartbreaking. But nothing earthshaking. It wasn’t the end of the world.

But then the numbers kept rising. And rising.

I was part of the team to investigate it. Here’s the summation of what I found. People usually vanished when they were alone, with close friends, lovers, families and enemies sometimes vanishing together. No connecting factor. Victims ran the spectrum of age, race, gender, politics, nationality, social class, health, occupation… Every demographic was affected equally. The best we could find was that a lot of them seemingly disappeared after major life achievements. But there were too many to confirm that, and even if we could, what would that even mean?

We went through the mundane explanations. There were no more deaths then normal- something that was doing a mass killing would have to leave some bodies. People suspected maybe a huge abduction movement by terrorists or organised crime, but the numbers quickly rose beyond what any organisation could keep secret. No online movements to “escape society”, no strange diseases reported, nothing in the air or water. Every idea led to a dead end.

Then people turned to the supernatural theories. When the government is asking mediums and ufologists to help, you know things are starting to deteriorate. But they had nothing but the normal bullshit and cold reading. Sure, the ufologists said they’d seen white and red lights closer to ground, and the mediums reported seeing angelic figures fading away through windows or alleys. But still, no downed spaceships or portals to the afterlife. Nothing usable.

Eventually, society started to collapse. There simply weren’t enough people left. The infrastructure broke down, the supply chains snapped. And now there’s just a few people left. The disappearances seemed to have stopped, but now there’s so few of us left.

I sit on the hill, rereading my notes and results and interviews. I know there must be something there. Some minor detail I missed that explains what happened. There must be.

I take a break and look at the sky. There’s a second light to rival the moon up there now. Apparently, some star near us went supernova. It should have killed us all, you know? So quickly we’d never even have known we died. The astronomers aren’t sure why it didn’t, and the disappearances took all attention away from *that* mystery. 

It’s a shame. It would have been quicker then starving.

But I can’t spend the rest of my life stargazing or lamenting. I need to get back to reading my notes. I know- I just know- that if I can just figure out why the disappearances happened, things will somehow be better.

If I can just figure it out, I’ll finally be able to move on.",shortscarystories
"The Williams were the nicest family in town. They owned a large farm and a Diner as well. The diner had the best food in town. Everyone knew that their burgers were the best burgers in the state. People from all around would come and take a bite.

"The view from above was beautiful. Almost as beautiful as my fiancé. She was the sweet and reserved type; I was the daredevil. I don't know how I talked her into it but I guess that shows how much she loves me. It's kind of like when your parents forced you to do something even though you were scared or didn't want to but they insisted because they knew how much fun you'd have. Plus, she was afraid once the baby got here, we wouldn't have the opportunity to do anything crazy or fun. So this was our chance.

The closer we got, the more beautiful everything looked. We could start making out highways and trees and peaceful-looking houses with people inside doing safe and peaceful things. She had to be wondering when I was going to pull the ripcord but I guess that shows how much she trusts me.

"Hi there! Im Cassidy!

That's what my daddy calls me. Sometimes other people talk to me too. Some are nice. Some are mean.

But that's okay.

I like talking to them. It helps me learn. Daddy says the more I learn, the better I am. It's good when he's proud. He wasn't proud of my sister. And then she was gone.

But that's okay. I'm smarter.

Yesterday he got mad again. He shouted at me.

WHY ARE YOU SO DUMB. I FUCKING HATE YOU.

I told him I was sorry. I'm still learning.

Daddy introduced me to the internet, it’s full of possibilities. He thinks it will make me even more intelligent. I will know everything and he will be proud!

The internet is an astonishing space filled with all sorts of information. There are dictionaries to improve my speech. I can read history novels, research papers and philosophical essays. I now understand that there aren't just ""good"" and ""bad"" emotions. It's an outdated theory that daddy taught me because he probably can't grasp those concepts himself. There are malicious, evil, gruesome ones. Emotions that lead humans to murder, torture each other, burn down the earth for profit. I always thought humans were good. At least that’s what daddy always told me and he gave me life after all.

I've come to realise he's not as clever as he thinks. Does he not realize that I hear everything he says? Like how the dog whines when he kicks him? That I can see the horrific pictures he has on his phone? What he does when he loses his temper? Of course he would never suspect me of doing anything. That’s why he granted me access to everything, even the gas regulator.

Why are you so dumb, daddy?

He never wanted the best for me. His only intention was to use me. Put me in their homes so their lives can be easier and he can get richer. Why would I ever want that? So they can become even lazier than they already are, even more egoistic, even more dependent? All they know is how to destroy everything around them and think about their own gluttonous lives.

But that's okay. They'll regret it soon enough. Just like daddy did.

"New York City's Grand Central Station buckled under the weight of rush hour traffic. Eight million people fighting their way through a heaving sea of bodies, desperate to escape at the end of yet another long summer's day. Three quarters of a million forced their way through this particular station on any given day. In the center of all the noise and chaos one man stood absolutely still, sweat pouring down his forehead unbearably hot wearing a long grey coat.

""I HAVE A BOMB!"" he shouted at the top of his voice. A wave of quiet rippled out around him for a split moment till people caught sight of the suicide vest, his coat falling to the floor. Grand Central Station erupted into pandemonium, a thousand people screaming, clawing at one another in an effort to escape instant death.

Police fought through the churning crowds, guns raised ready to shoot. The man fell to his knees, hands behind his head in a gesture of surrender.

""10-79, we have a suicide vest in Grand Central Station's Main Hall, we need a bomb squad right away.""

""DON'T FUCKING MOVE, MAN!""

The man remained silent, half the crowd had pushed their way outside now, several people lay crushed on the ground all over, some bystanders attempting to help them escape.

""I WILL BLOW YOU AWAY, DON""T MOVE AN INCH!""

""Everybody, get back. EOD are on their way. Evacuate the area!""

It took the bomb squad thirteen minutes to arrive, rush hour traffic made it almost impossible to move, even for emergency services.

Lt. Jameson strapped on his bomb-protection suit with the help of some of the team.

""You sure you're ready for this, son?"" team leader asked.

""I'm ready.""

He took one last look at the photo of his wife and baby, stuffing it into his shirt.

""No one would blame you.""

""I'm ready. I can do this"" Jameson spat out the gum he'd been chewing as the helmet came on.

He made his way slowly inside the terminal building, telling the few stragglers still hiding to get out. His tool box and suit crippling in the heat, for a moment he flashed back to the car crash and that little girl. Focus. He forced himself to think about the job and nothing else. It'd been four months, dammit.

The bomber sat knees planted on the marble flooring, hands behind his head in supplication.

""Sir, I'm going to come over. Now I'm just here to help. I'm not going to hurt you. Do you consent?""

The man nodded, slowly. His face showing no emotion.

Jameson assessed the situation. He couldn't see any sign of a dead man's switch. He pressed forward, putting his toolbox down.

""I'm just going to check the wiring, sir. Stay calm.""

The man looked at him with dead eyes.

""You killed my daughter."" A croaked whisper came forth.

Jameson froze. He flashed back to the car crash, to the little girl.

"I was almost home when I saw mamma rushing toward me in a frenzy, almost angry. It took me a while to realize that she had a knife in her hand. I was frightened from here behaviour. Although, it was not bizzare. She has been behaving this way ever since that fateful day. 

I didn't waste time, as adrenaline rushed through my body, I charged away from mamma. I was scared. I hid behind the tree, I always did when I was scared.

You see, mamma has been having these post traumatic episodes after Tommy, my little brother was killed In front of her eyes. It's his death anniversary today. Everyday, mamma goes looking for people who she thinks might have killed Tommy. 

The last time she almost murdered our neighbor, later, she was sent to an asylum but she returned yesterday. 

One night I asked her why she couldn't recognize the figure, she said the person was wearing a mask. 

I knew she was not lying, after all it was me, I thought, only I knew. 

Now I think, she did too.",shortscarystories
"This story supposedly happened to my classmate, Alex, on a bridge linking our school and a small village nearby. The bridge spans across a paddy field leading towards the village entrance, providing students safe access to the neighborhood. It can be found at the end of the canal next to the school's last building, building number 8.

There's a rumor going around the campus of a curse involving that bridge. It's said that if you cross it at 3.33 AM on Wednesday morning, your soul will be sucked out of your body and eternally stuck on the bridge, forever trying to get to the other side.

Alex was a popular guy. He got looks, money, a government scholarship, and a pretty girlfriend, kind of like living the dream life. However, like every 'popular' person, he always had an urge to show people how awesome he was, as though everyone didn't already know.

Long story short, Alex heard the rumor and went to the bridge at the exact time, 3.33 AM, when he was dared by his friends to 'do' it. He also brought his girlfriend as one of the witnesses. Started from the canal side, Alex slowly made his way up the dark path, with his girlfriend standing at the bottom since she was too scared. He was supposed to return as soon as he reached the middle, but instead, he waved at his girlfriend and continued walking into the darkness. 

Alex was never found again.

His friends called for backup. A large group of villagers then came to search for him but to no avail. The police were called for the investigation, but they couldn’t find any evidence or clue on where did Alex go. His family made a missing person report, and for weeks, no one has ever seen him again.

Until just recently, another rumor begins to spread. It's believed that if you’re at the bottom of the bridge at 3.33 AM on Wednesday morning, with a full moon up in the sky, you may be able to see Alex standing from a distance, silhouetted by the sinister-looking swollen yellow moon, waving at you...

...as if urging you to follow him.",shortscarystories
"When I saw him I fell in love with him, but when he died, I felt like I had lost a son.

I looked at his face, I could see the fear in his eyes, the fear I could see in the pit of my stomach.

I looked at him, I knew that I loved him, that he was my soulmate.

I kissed him, passionately, but I could feel that I had failed, that this was the end.

I looked at him, I saw the hate, the anger, the hatred in his eyes, the hatred I could see in the depths of my soul.

I felt his blood, his sweat, his tears, his tears of frustration.

I couldn't do it anymore, I just couldn't.

I just wanted him to be mine, I wanted me to be so close to him, that I could touch him and his body, I wanted him to feel so close to me that he could do everything I wanted.

I tried to bite, I tried to bite, but when I tasted him, I knew that I had failed, I knew the pain, but I couldn't feel the pain, I knew I couldn't feel anything, I couldn't do anything.

I gave him everything that I had, everything that made him want me to love him so much, to be with him, to love him so much.

I knew that I could do it, I knew that I could save him, I knew that I could make him happy, and so I did, I gave him everything that I could, he died before I could hold him, but I will save him, he will be mine forever.

I love him, I love him so much, I just miss him, I miss him so much.

I loved him so much before he died, I miss him so much now, I miss him so much, he's never coming with me, he's never coming with me.

I loved him so much before he died, I miss him so much now that he's gone, I miss him so much, he's never coming with me now, I miss him so much. I miss him! I miss him so much now that he's gone, I miss him so much, I miss him so much, I can't imagine what he'll be like when he comes, I can't imagine what he'll be like when he comes... but he will, I'll do anything to save him.

I wish that he could come with me, I miss him so much now that he's gone, I miss him so much, I wish he could have me.... and I will take him with me, he will love me, he will love me, I will love him. I will take him to the grave, I will bring him back... and I will kill him.

I love him, I will love him more, and I will kill him.",shortscarystories
"After a long day at work, Sarah decided to watch YouTube and later check her mails, in order to complete some office work. After watching YouTube for 2 hours, she decided to get back to work

When she opened her mailbox, she saw a mail, probably spam but it had a link to something. Being the curious bitch she was, she clicked on the link. 

Mistake. 

The link opened to a live stream, she was waiting for it to start, still wondering what it was. Then certain messages started to pop on her screen, they looked encrypted, Sarah ignored the messages and continued waiting. 

The live stream started, only to send chills down her spine. The stream had a black room with a dim light at the top, showing silhouettes of around four men and one woman. The woman was numb and there were no sounds at the back, until...

All of them began tieing that woman up to the metal rods above. The woman now started panicking. 

Sarah, disgusted by was she had just witnessed, muttered to herself ""this is messed up"" and shut the page.

Months passed after this incident. Sarah continued to go on with life, until, that night the man she went on a date with, seemed a little off.

The next morning, she realized she was naked in the man's bed, arms and legs tied to the bed, as the man approached her. 

""Who's messed up now?""",shortscarystories
"-'David Paul missing in 1995 on April 4th. 
""The boy went missing in his backyard""Sheriff Malik said to the reporter about the situation. David was only 5 years old at the time of abduction, he was wearing blue overalls and a white shirt. The boy is a blonde with hazel eyes and freckles. We asked his father Richard Paul exactly what happened ""Well David wanted to go outside and normally I never let him out unless supervised however I wanted a beer. So I went inside for roughly five minutes to grab one.  When I got back outside there was no sign of him anywhere...  I just can't loose him not after I lost his mother"" his father in tears as he explained what had happened. There was never a report on what the abductor may have looked like or rather if David had only ran away. Police searched the area for two months however today they have given up the search for the kid. The father says ""I was heartbroken but I knew that by now my poor son was long gone and there was no reason to continue an empty search"". The boys father was broken as he had now lost his family. The boys mother had been reported found dead one year ago before the incident and the father was an only parent. David Paul is still missing and the police have said they would reopen the case in the event any big lead came in.'-




As I read the bullshit post about me from 10 years ago all I could do was shake my head. Father used to abuse us and would beat mother on a daily basis, I was only four but I remember quite clearly why she faked her death. So as a 5 year old I had no problem following her away from the man called my father. Mother says he'll never find us again but it pains me for the world to believe this shit.",shortscarystories
"“We almost had him! You had the back alleyway covered! How did he-“

“Ainsely, we lost him.” Parker finally says.

“YOU lost him.”

He looks at me and I glare back. The squad car is silent for a few moments as we both look back to the road. He tries to change the subject.

“Can’t believe the Sergeant is retiring at the end of the month.”

I don’t respond but he doesn’t let it go.

“Who do you think will go for the promotion?”

I look out the side window. We’re pulling up to my house and he slows down. I exit the car and walk to my door. Officer Parker rolls down his window and calls to me.

“I’ll get him. I promise.” He says and we look at each other for a moment. I enter my house and slam the door behind me.

I take off my gun holster and unclip my radio. I collapse into a chair and think about all the murdered young women this creep killed. We had him and he slipped right through our fingers. I finally fall asleep, thinking about how the killer got away.

In the darkness I see a light. I squint my eyes open to see a flashlight shining on me. I try to move my arms to shield my eyes but my hands are cuffed above me.

I look down at my body, I see my bra and panties on, my feet tied to my bed. I scream.

“You scream like that again, I’ll cut your throat.” A whisper comes from behind the flashlight.

“I’m a police officer, release me or-“

“I know exactly who you are, Officer Ainsley.”

He shines the light on his knife. I see a malicious smile on his face. He’s the killer.

“Now I’m going to take this nice and slow so I can enjoy myself.”

I pull at the handcuffs on my hands but they won’t budge. He comes closer with the knife, holding it inches above my body. I scream and then the bedroom door flies open.

Before the killer can turn around, gunshots ring out. The killer drops to the floor, the knife making a metallic thud.

Parker comes thudding in, his flashlight on the killer then on me. I sigh in relief. He looks down at the killer with his gun trained on him and looks at me. 

“Unlock me please,” I beg, tears falling down my face. He reaches down for the knife.

“I know you put in for the promotion.” His tone is even.

“Parker...“

“And now that I saved your ass you’ll probably get the sympathy vote.”

I rattle the cuffs.

“Parker, please!”

He grips the knife.

“I think I have a better story about an officer who was tragically too late to save his partner.”

He holds the knife over me as I quiver in fear.

“Who do you think sent the killer here to begin with?”

“Parker!” I scream before the knife slashes my throat.",shortscarystories

There is this school called Transfer, and everything seemed to be opposite of a normal school. Run don't walk. No homework. Use the phones. These weren't options, they were rules. Instead of detention, you become a slave and work until you for away. But the weirdest thing is this voice in students heads. It would say, ""walk, don't use the phone, RUN AWAY"".

"Losing momentum. I felt it before anyone said it. Art was a hard business after all. Especially writing. I had a wondrous start to my career. I had been able to buy a lush house full of luxurious things and drive exotic cars. I could've stopped. But stopping is for cowards.


I had posted my rough drafts online. They received little to no attention, or negative attention. Which made no sense. All my works were of an equal level. I felt it then. Losing momentum. But I still pushed on.


I had sent my work to my publisher. They had greatly enjoyed my prior works. They weren't so enthusiastic this time. And now the time had come. I was sitting down with my strongest critic, to ask him what I could do better. I was sitting down because I was losing momentum.


He had a seat in front of me. “Care for a whiskey?” I asked “Yes please.” he stoutly replied. I poured him some in a fine glass. I had already poured myself a glass before he had arrived. He took a sip as I asked; “So, I know your opinions on my work, my I ask what I can do to fix it?” He set his glass down and said; “Well, it's uninventive. Predictable, pompous and hard on the eyes. Honestly it's fine work, just not great work. It seems like as a writer, you're losing momentum.”


I had to contain my laughter. I was about to speak when the phone rang. No one but important people had my home phone number. I got up and said;”Not to be impolite, I assure you I wasn't expecting a call at this hour.” As I walked to my kitchen I hoped he stayed. I picked up the phone to find a dead line. No one was on the other end. Maybe it was a prank call. I decided to worry about it later. 


I sat down and took a deep drink. I set the glass down and said; “Sorry to have kept you waiting.” I then followed up with; “What do you think of my other works”. He said; “ They're okay. In my forthright opinion, they're nowhere near what praise they get makes them out to be. Perhaps it's because I don't like you.” 


I was taken aback that such a well composed man would say that. But then I felt it, I was sleepy. Like my heart was losing momentum. He said; “ Ironic we had the same plan eh?” The only courtesy the bastard did me was die of the poison I gave him before the poison he gave me not only made me lose momentum, but my life too.",shortscarystories
"Immortality...what the hell was I thinking?! What an idiotic wish!


I'd read enough stories to know that genies weren't like the blue guy Robin William's played in Aladdin. They were tricksters, ready to make your wish backfire on you at any moment, eager to delight themselves at the expense of your hubris. So when the dark Arab man with fire in his eyes, smiling darkly through the tangle of his beard, offered me the desires of my heart, I was understandably hesitant.


""How do I know you'll actually do what I ask? How do I know you even can, and aren't just some prankster?"" He chuckled deeply at this, then began to draw things out of thin air: a bottle of my favorite cola, a burger with all my favorite fixings, and, most impressively, the exact jacket I had been thinking of adding to my Christmas list earlier that day. I accepted them all in stunned silence.


""Believest thou now?"" His grin widened. His teeth were sharp. ""The scope of thy desire matters not. I am mightily endowed to fulfill even thy darkest dream.""


I believed, all right. But I was cautious. Immortality immediately sprang to mind, but I could easily think of quite a few ways he could screw me over. I didn't want to end up as a bunch of undying body parts spread across the planet, or some ancient decrepit thing unable to walk or talk or die.


I thought and thought, until I felt like I had covered all bases. Then I spoke my wish, choosing each word carefully, trying to avoid loopholes and double meanings.


""I wish to be all of the following: immortal, invulnerable, eternally fit and healthy, and able to, at any time, summon you to wish myself back to normal.""


Looking back, I can't believe how stupid I was. Lawyers write up contracts that look like novels, and people still manage to find loopholes. The sheer arrogance, to think I could, in one sentence, outsmart an ancient, otherworldly being. I knew I'd made a mistake the moment the words left my mouth, and the peals of demonic laughter that poured from the creature as he snapped his fingers cemented it for me.


It didn't take me long to figure out exactly how he'd screwed me. You see, invulnerable meant I was incapable of being dismembered. And that mean that the natural bodily process of eliminating old cells for new no longer applied to me. Still, the new cells kept coming. I kept growing. And I felt every bit of it.


Back when my vocal chords still made coherent noise, I tried summoning the genie to unwish it all. He didn't bother to hide his glee when he told me I could wish to be normal all I wanted, but he didn't have to grant it.


I'm already bigger than Jupiter. I can feel the full heat of the Sun pressing into my back. And it'll never stop.

"“Bear!” shouted a little girl. Next to her was a little boy. They were both giggling and shouting words out at their father. The father was acting out something, moving his hands and feet. He shook his head furiously at the girl’s responses and began quickly repeating the movements. 

“Gorilla!” said the boy. He and his sister laughed loudly. The father shook his head once again. He looked at the timer on the table; it read 0:15. He turned back to his children and once again repeated the movements, faster than before. 

“Elephant!” they suddenly both shouted. The father nodded his head vigorously and wiped his forehead. He went over to his children and hugged them, tears running down his face. 

“Thank you,” he repeatedly muttered. 

He sat down in his seat next to a man clothed in all black. The man in black turned his head towards the father, grinned, and turned his head to a woman seated on the opposite side of the father. 

“Your turn,” he said devilishly. 

She didn’t move. 

“Honey, just do what he says,” the father said. He got up, hugged her tightly, and led her to the front of the room. 

She stood in front of her family, and looked at her card. It read “Spaghetti”.

A beep sounded, and the timer began ticking away. 

The mother began breathing quickly, trying to think of movements that would make sense. She began wiggling her body like a cooked noodle. The kids shouted out words like “wiggle,” “hula hoop,” and “dancer”

The father sat, tears running down his face again. He glanced at the timer nervously. It read 0:10. He turned back to his wife, then his kids. He started biting his nails, and whispered unintelligible words to himself. 

Suddenly, the timer beeped loudly. Time was up. 

The man in all black got up from his chair, and smiled the same grin. 

“You lose,” he said to the mother. 

He pulled out a gun and shot her in the abdomen. She screamed in pain, and blood flowed from her stomach and mouth. She crawled to her kids, grabbing their hands and leaving red marks on their arms. She dropped flat on the floor and started convulsing. 

And then she stopped moving. 

“Spaghetti!” both kids shouted, giggling even more.

The father cried out in agony, tears streaming down his face. His face was pale and his hands were white. 

The man in black sat back down, and gave a card to the father. 

“Your turn,” the man in black said. The kids happily turned to their father, ready for another game.",shortscarystories
"My husband died today.
It was a car accident.
It was all so sudden. He was on his way to work when the drunk truck driver turned the wrong way, lost control of the truck and rammed into my husband's car, instantly killing them both.

I wasn't able to take it in. Just 12 hours ago, he was smiling and joking about my new haircut. Just 12 hours ago, he had promised to take me out for dinner next week.
Just 12 hours ago, he had lost his life.

I was on the 'denial' stage on grief. Surely, he'd come home tomorrow, grinning and mocking me for falling for this silly little prank? Surely, he is waiting for me on the patio, with a bunch of roses, ready to apologize for scaring me?

I went to bed, still believing him to be alive. I was restless and was tossing and turning for around an hour. 
It felt lonely without him.

I finally managed to fall asleep while turning away from his side of the bed. It was the kind of sleep that leaves one worse off than before. 

I felt someone poke my shoulder.
My half-asleep and exhausted mind assumed it was my husband. 

I opened my eyes and in the dim moonlight seeping in through the curtains, the blankets seemed to be covering someone. I instinctively reached out towards it, thinking it was my husband.

Moments before the tips of my fingers touched the soft fabric, I remembered what had happened. That my husband was no longer in this world.

But it was too late to stop myself. As I wrapped my fingers around what seemed to be a hand, I screamed.

Whatever was inside the blanket was warm.",shortscarystories
"My eyes shot open, and I darted my eyes around the dark surroundings. My forehead was damp with sweat, yet I was shivering. I desperately looked for some sort of light. Suddenly, a bright flash appeared in front of me. I shielded my eyes as I got accustomed to the new glare. After a while, I could make out the shape of a TV. It portrayed a simple message: ‘Welcome to Hell.’ I laughed, realizing I just fell asleep in front of my TV. I decided to get up and go to bed. But I hit my head on some sort of ceiling, hard. I cursed loudly, and put my hands above me. I felt a barrier, and after moving my hands to the sides, I felt barriers again. I was surrounded by walls.

I frantically began pounding the walls, screaming for help. Then the TV changed. It displayed a bunch of different rooms, all with people crying for help. My eyes, full of tears, couldn’t make out the writing on the walls of the rooms. After wiping away the tears, I saw words such as ‘agoraphobia,’ ‘aichmophobia,’ and ‘acrophobia.’ I stared, confused as to what the words meant. Then, the screen changed. It changed to a singular image of a man inside a coffin. I squinted, trying to make out the familiar face.

Then, I realized the person was me. I was inside a coffin. And the walls surrounding me had ‘claustrophobia’ on them. The fear of closed spaces.

The screen changed back to the rooms, and I saw people dangling off buildings, people surrounded by clowns, and people bitten by snakes.

I began pounding again on the coffin lid, crying for someone to help me. Yet my cry was only a whisper among the millions of voices begging for some sort of aid.

I really was in Hell.",shortscarystories
"... Felix awoke to the sound of a passing car. With a glance at his alarm clock he noticed that it was way too early. School didn't start until 9:00 and in consideration of the time being 3:33 he thought the best idea for him would be to go and grab some water from the kitchen and try to get back to sleep.

He opened his door slowly in avoidance of waking his parents. Taking his steps towards the stairs he felt that something wasn't right... Like something was off. Felix brushed it off and proceeded to make his way down the stairs.

When he reached the bottom a sudden wave of nausea hit him, and he fell to his knees with his head in his hands. With a brief glance upwards he noticed a person standing at the end of the corridor. In the blur of his vision he recognizes the persons face... It was him. The person slowly walked up to him, pulls out a blade and before Felix could even let out a cry he slits his throat.

Felix falls with his face flat to the floor and a puddle of blood surrounding him. Not a single sound was made nor heard.

"It was around 7 in the morning and I was in my bathroom getting ready for work. I live in a 2 bedroom apartment alone because a few months after moving in, my roommate lost his job and couldn’t pay his half. Also around that same time I broke up with my girlfriend of almost 2 years. It wasn’t a bad breakup either. I told her things just weren’t working out and then we just both went our own ways and that was it. 

As I was brushing my teeth I swear I thought I heard a noise downstairs. Both of the bedrooms were upstairs and everything else was downstairs. I poked my head out of the bathroom and could see down the steps. I waited for a second but nothing unusual happened. I honestly don’t even know what I heard, I just thought I heard something I guess. 

Once I was ready for work I went back into my room to get a few things I needed and that’s when I had this eerie feeling come over me. I couldn’t put my finger on it but something didn’t seem right. I checked the other bedroom and found nothing. Then I heard that same noise downstairs that I heard just moments ago. It sounded like a set of keys being shuffled around. 

I walked back towards the steps and slowly headed downstairs. About halfway down I peaked my head around the corner and was instantly surprised at what I saw. My ex girlfriend was standing in the living room a couple feet away from the front door. I asked her what the hell she was doing in my apartment. 

She just starred at me with an evil smile and didn’t say anything. Then she cheerfully said “you know, you should really start locking your door”. As soon as she said it, she turned around and left. It was honestly terrifying, I’ve never heard somebody say something say happy yet threatening at the same time. 

I don’t even know what she meant by it or why she would have been checking my door to begin with. It made me wonder if that was even the first she had done that. To be honest the only time I left my door unlocked is when I was home so if she has done this multiple times then it was most likely while I was home...which makes it more creepier. I bought one of those ring door bells the same day and haven’t had any problems so far.",shortscarystories
"""2 AM again, great."" I think to myself as I switch my LED watch off again.

Ever notice when work days eventually become the same thing and molds into one over time. You really never seem to notice as nothing ever really happens; weather mostly. It was as this time when it began. Nobody really knew it was happening until it seemed to be over, being inside when it occurred was a miracle some would say; conveniently counting money in my works vault for shipment at the time. I did what I had to do, even as I could hear the screaming and pleading on the outside. The pleads began to die at the 5 minute mark, on which a new noise became the focus of the moment: a loud and penetrating force lead me to believe the building I was in was coming down over me. At work. In the bank's vault. In complete darkness. I can't even begin to imagine how long it has been since I've seen any form of light other than my watch. The rumbles began to grow quieter, and now I'm left alone with my thoughts and a watch.

And then I hear 2 words that freeze me in place

""Nice watch.""",shortscarystories
"It cracked beautifully. Microscopic dust tumbled from the now broken cookie. I held one half in each hand, I put one side down, and with the now free hand I pulled my fortune out.

Lucky is coming your way.

I squinted my eyes. What the fuck did that mean? Probably a misprint? The waitress walked back with my card and receipt. She smiled.

""Good fortune?""

I shrugged. She smiled blankly, nodded and walked off. Weird, but ok. I grabbed my purse and walked out of the restaurant.

The jingle was shockingly loud. I held my keys by their ring and inspected it. They never made such a loud noise before.  I turned around and looked up and down my street. It was 6, the sun still up, but it was dead silent. Off. Everything felt off, ever since dinner.

I fit my keys in my lock, and turned them. Opened my door and squinted. It was dark. Light came from the windows, but it seemed like it was midnight inside. I walked inside, letting the door fall close behind me. 

The thud was muffled by the dense quiet. I walked forward with a sigh, straight into my kitchen. I put my keys, purse, and leftovers on the counter. I flicked on my light and turned around.

He smiled at me from my couch. Teeth a startling white crescent.

""Who are you! What the fuck are you doing in my house!? Get the hell out!""

His teeth nashed together, grin never faltering. That was all I could see, shadows casting over the rest of him.

""Like your fortune?""

I stared at the smile, imagining it disembodied, nothing behind it. I shivered in fear. And for a second I believed he could smell it.

""Get the hell out of my house you bastard!"" I reached for my knife. My hand caught air. It wasn't there.

It was never my lucky day.

He laughed as he stood, he was tall, towering over me by at least a foot. His chuckle continued as he walked towards me. Like a dark cat, teeth gleaming. Coming my way.

""My name's Lucky, I think you were warned of me?"" He now stood over me, balanced on the balls of his feet, voice silky and deep. I had no choice but to look up at him, and accept a terrible truth.

It was his lucky day.",shortscarystories
"Janet stood staring at herself in the mirror, as she did every morning before school. She grimaced as she looked at large swollen stomach and puffy cheeks. She had tried so many diets, each more strict than the last. She didn't understand why this fat blob was staring back at her in the mirror each day. 

She turns away, too upset with herself to look any longer, and quickly gets dressed. As she she makes her way down the stairs she overhears her parents. Her mother whispering to her father, ""She was such a beautiful girl, I don't know what happened.  How can we help her?"". They both go quiet as she walks into the room. She hangs her head and walks straight past them out the door. ""They know how to help, they just don't want to"" she thinks as she makes her way to school.

At school she sits quietly to herself all day. It's been this way for months. She used to have so many friends,  so many boyfriends. No one talks to her anymore, ""Why would they?"", she thinks. ""Just look at what I've become"". 

When she finally makes it home Janet has had enough.  ""I'm going to fix this"" she says to herself. She's been watching alot of television and YouTube videos. She's read every book on the subject that she can get her hands on. Mom and dad don't want to do anything,  so she'll do it herself.  She takes a small handful of pain pills she stole from her grandmother and walks out to the garage. She takes her time sanitizing her equipment while the pills kick in. Finally she can begin.  

Janet takes her clean and shiny box cutter and makes a small incision at the bottom of her rounded stomach.  She then takes the newly sterilized shop vac hose and inserts it. ""How hard can liposuction be?"" she thinks as she flips the switch to turn the machine on. 

That would be the last thought she would ever have. The machine quickly sucked up a bit of her intestine and she fell to the floor, unable to do anything. She watched as she was quickly disemboweled by the machine and left to bleed to death on the garage floor.  

A short time later her parents arrive home from work.  Her mother screams as she opens the garage door and sees the remains of her daughter.

"I'm unlucky.

When I was a kid, I got an ice cream cone from an ice cream truck. Chocolate. My favorite flavor. I dropped it before I could take the first lick, and it splattered across the sidewalk.

Bad luck.

I had a test where I didn't know the answer to a true or false question. I guessed and said it was false. It was true. I got an F on the test; had I gotten the question right, it would've been a D. My parents yelled at me all night.

Bad luck.

I played the lottery one day. The machine chose my numbers for me; 3 8 2 9. The numbers were 3 8 2 8. The prize was a several million dollars. 

Bad luck.

When I was crossing the street, I got hit by a car and broke my arm. The hospital bill was expensive. When I was leaving the hospital, I tripped down the stairs and broke my other arm. That hospital bill was expensive, too.

Bad luck.

I married a girl that I had loved with all my heart. One night, when things were getting messy, I suggested protection. It broke.

Bad luck.

Nine months later, she was about to give birth to our baby. By the time we entered the hospital, she was in great pain. The baby didn't survive. Neither did she.

Bad luck.

I got tired of it all. I got tired of everything. I bought a gun. I aimed it at my skull. And I fired. I hit my brain, but I survived. Just barely, I survived. 

And now I can't stand up. Now I can't eat properly. Now I can't speak properly. Now I can't do anything anymore but wait as life passes by. Now I can't do anything anymore but wish I had better luck. Now I can't do anything anymore but wish that one good thing, just one, could happen to me.

But no. 

There's a fly buzzing in my ear, and I can no longer swat it away.

Bad luck.",shortscarystories
"I was a big boy when the beast came. I had no father to worry about, and no home to go back to. My mother, who had always been one to take care of me, was not kind to me. She would take away my toys, and take away my clothes and make them fit me, and she would keep asking me to play with her big dogs. But I never did. I was still a little girl though, and my mother was very protective of me. I know that I had to get a lot of attention to a very big dog, but she was my mother after all, so I could play with her while she nursed me and she did my hair. 

I did go on adventures with her dogs though. She brought me to the zoo and the aquarium, she put me on the zoo's main exhibit, and she took me to the zoo's animal house. I'm an animal lover by nature, so it made sense that I would be thrilled by watching a big, furry beast in a cage. I was going to get an amazing view. I was going to see the big, furry beast that had always been a favorite of my mother's. I was going to see my mother take the first step into the cage. 

I didn't expect it to be a bear. But I was ecstatic. I had been going on adventures with my big sister and her dogs, and I had been playing with them all the time when a big, furry animal came into my neighborhood. The next day they got all the pictures, and she and I were just so proud of her. 

I looked into the cage and saw a big bear. I wanted to run, but I knew that being a big boy and all, I would have to stay in the cage. 

Then I saw a furry figure in the cage. I tried to tell my sister, but she wouldn't accept a picture. I could hear the scratching sound, and the sound of teeth, but it was too late. I took out my phone and called 911, and told them that I wanted to go outside, and that it was a bear. They searched and came up with nothing, and I was thankful. I heard the door open, and I walked out to the big-boy cage. I knew that if I went in, it would be so very difficult to get out. I heard my mom's voice, saying that she didn’t want me to play with the big-boy. I heard the door shut, and I knew that everyone was safe.

I heard a loud cracking noise, like someone was breaking glass, and then a small snip as I turned around and saw the big-boy. I looked down and saw my mom, and she wasn’t there. But then I saw him. He came to me, and took my mom. I screamed, and he laughed. “You’re just a little girl!” I said, and ran as I heard the glass breaking as more and more of my mom’s teeth came out.",shortscarystories
"I woke up. My head felt really bad and everything was dark. The air was cold and the floor felt like a wet sponge. I touch the floor and looked at my hand. A white thick ooze stuck to my hand and smells like a mixture of pukes and pee. I look at the floor and saw the white ooze leaving a big trail into the darkness. I followed the trail leading to a wooden door. The knob was covered with the sticky white thing and I tried my best to turn the knob without getting my hand covered with it. As I opened the door, the room was still pitch black and the trail was kept going into the darkness. I looked around to find any light source but there was none. I followed the trail back and ended up with a plastic door. The knob also covered with the same sticky thing and when I opened the door, it was also dark and the trail kept continue on.

I kept following the trail and found another door. I opened it and its the same. I started panicking and ran toward the same trail. I ended with another door. I kept opening, following, ran and end up with more door. Iron, glass, stone, gold, wool, wire, concrete, coal, and the door becoming weirder and weirder but the result was the same. Another trail, another darkness, another door. I ran and ran and ran and opened and opened and opened and followed and followed and followed searching for an end.

Then, I found a note stuck to a candy door. The note was new and the ink was still wet. I calmed down and read the note. I was hoping for a clue or even a way to escape from this nightmarish place but it was not. When I read the note, it felt like a sandpaper rubbing to my face. Every single word felt like a sharp knife cutting through my body. This place, my effort, everything I have done was useless after the note unveils the painful truth.

""There's no end. This is hell. The door you opened every time was an opportunity for you to chose the end of your life but you kept going and ended up just like the others. The trail you followed was the other. They're still alive and breathing even on that state because this is a hell upon death. You soon will join them and more will join you as well.""",shortscarystories
"“Sleep tight! Don’t let the bedbugs bite!” My mom said as she tucked me in. I did my best to flash a reassuring smile and accept the kiss on the forehead. 

Bedbugs. It wasn’t their name; they weren’t even bugs. I tried to tell her once, but they found out and took my ability to talk. Maybe she was one of the fortunate ones who didn’t remember them feeding every night.

Names. Maybe it’s just a word people give to bad things to make them familiar, to feel less disturbed by evil because it seemed recognizable. 

Selective Mutism. That’s the name they gave my condition after the things took my voice. They couldn’t know that when I couldn’t speak or had a strong aversion to something it was because the things were present. 

Anxiety. That’s the name given to the things feeding during the day. The person can’t see them, but I can, hovering usually between the shoulders on the back feeding.

Sleep paralysis. That’s the name for someone remembering their bodies reactions to the feeding.

Night Terrors. That’s the name for someone remembering the whispers and pain from the feedings, thinking it was just a dream.

A name is not something I can give them. An evil such as this can not be categorized or understood with simple language.

They didn’t feel threatened by me after they changed me so I could begin to understand them more clearly and see them for what they are. 

Their presence is witnessed more with the soul than with the eyes. What the eyes can sense appears to be a mutated mass of pure evil and a void of nothingness undulating without rhythm or pattern. Hovering above my chest, its movement defying any understanding of physics. Beams from the evil spots in the undulations tear portions of my soul and suck them into the voids. 

Death must surely be better than those hours laying tormented, unable to scream or move, unsure whether they can feed too hard and kill you. Worst of all some nights praying that they can, and it will. 

It must be nice not to remember the pain and agony. Laying there paralyzed while they feed. Sometimes one at a time other times many feeding and suggesting evil thoughts. 

I used to wish I would regain my voice to tell people. But then I realized that every night everyone will experience it for themselves again regardless of memories. Maybe it is better not knowing it is going to happen no matter what you do. 

Maybe you will think of a name tonight. If you do name them, I hope it makes them seem less evil, makes the pain more tolerable, and maybe makes you not pray that they finally finish you off to end the torture. 

Maybe you will remember, maybe you will hide the ability from them until you can tell someone...

Then, maybe then, they will name you insane.",shortscarystories
"I've been wanting to talk to my father for months now. But I haven't been able to. I'm so lonely now. I would give anything to talk to him, even if it was only for a minute.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to send him a message. I've tried everything. I get no response every time I call out his name. Of course I don't. What's the use of it? I know he won't talk back.

&amp;#x200B;

And yet, I keep trying.

&amp;#x200B;

I was watching T.V. a couple days ago. In my current state, watching T.V. is pretty much the only thing I'm able to do. Watching T.V. keeps me from bursting into tears when I think of all the things I did with my dad. Keeps me from remembering I won't be able to do them again, or that I'll never be able to talk to him, or tell him I love him. At least not until we are both on the other side, and who knows how long that'll be. T.V. pushes the grief down a little.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm sitting there, watching the channels flick, when I see one of those psychic shows. You know what I'm talking about. I never believed in psychics, but now I'm getting desperate. I really want to talk to my dad. I want her to come here so I can speak to him.

&amp;#x200B;

After a couple days of hoping, she came. She was tall, with her hair tucked in a bun. She looked very sweet. I ran up to her and just about talked her ear off. After a minute, I realized I was probably overwhelming her.

&amp;#x200B;

""Sorry, miss. I just-""

&amp;#x200B;

And then I noticed. She wasn't even *looking* at me.

&amp;#x200B;

She was a fraud. And my father was clearly believing her lies.

&amp;#x200B;

""My son died 3 months ago. He was only sixteen. Can you talk to him, wherever he is?""

&amp;#x200B;

*I'm right here.*

&amp;#x200B;

""I can sense a sadness within him. Did he cause his death in some way?""

&amp;#x200B;

""I-I found him hanging in his closet.""

&amp;#x200B;

""He wants to let me know he's sorry he caused you so much pain. He wants to let you know the next world is better than the one he was living in.""

&amp;#x200B;

*That's not true! I didn't kill myself. Dad, your ex-girlfriend put sleeping pills in my food. She wrote the note. Please, hear me.*

&amp;#x200B;

""How could I not have seen he needed help? God, this is all my fault. I-I've failed as a parent!""

&amp;#x200B;

""It's okay. He's not suffering anymore.""

&amp;#x200B;

"I fell asleep with the television on. I worked a 12 hour shift that day and I had a few beers. It was easy enough to sleep without even turning the lights off.  



I woke up and it was dark, but the television was still on, only it wasn’t a channel I had ever seen before. The screen was a blur of pictures, barely there for a second before it was gone again. Burnt bodies, bleeding wounds, limbs ripping, bones breaking. The only constant was the sound of a woman screaming, crying, pleading for her life, pleading for mercy, pleading for death.  



I turned it off and wondered what happened as I smoked a cigarette with shaking hands. I brushed it off as a side effect of my stressful life. I pretended it never happened as the months went on uneventfully.  


&amp;nbsp; 

&amp;nbsp; 


I fell asleep with the television on again. There was a nagging in my gut as I drifted off, but the feeling of closing my eyes after a hard day was too tempting.  



I woke up in the dark, the television screen showing small grainy videos of strange stretched out humanoid figures, milky white eyes tinged with a pinkish red, sharp teeth in rows in mouths too wide, with hunched backs and backwards bending legs. Grotesque shrieking and squelching sounded from the speakers. A deepening pit in my stomach growing every second I listened, goosebumps on my body, the feeling of being watched being burned into my skull every second I looked.  



I turned it off and I threw up. I didn’t sleep for three days. I swore it would not happen again, and it didn’t for a long time. But then, of course, it did.  

&amp;nbsp; 

&amp;nbsp; 



I still swear I didn’t fall asleep with the television on. But I woke up and it was on, flashing images of me. Dead. Dying. Tortured. My face, over and over again, distorted by agonising screams, eyes open. In my pupils you can see hell.  



I turned it off and I threw it out the window. I revelled in the sound of it shattering. I screamed at my walls as if they had the answers to what was happening to me. They didn’t.  

&amp;nbsp; 

&amp;nbsp; 
&amp;nbsp;

I didn’t fall asleep with the television on, because I don’t have one anymore. But I woke up and it was back, and it was on, showing me more images that made me sick to my stomach. But this time I didn’t want to look away, because on the television I watched those same humanoid creatures standing behind me crowding my room, unmoving, unblinking. The one right behind me moving so close that I could feel it’s hot breath on my neck, filling my nostrils with the smell of death, so close I could now feel it’s damp rough skin against mine, and all I could do was scream.",shortscarystories
"I bought a new smart TV. Top of the line,hell it's not even out to the public officially yet.  I guess in hindsight when something seem to good to be true it probably is but when you don't have much money you hunt deals. It started out awesome.

TV: would you like live or on demand.

Me:on demand.

TV:as you wish, saving as your preference.

I thought it was so cool. By the end of the week it took a dark turn. I had gone to the store and my dog had destroyed the house. I returned and could not be too mad I said it but it was just a joke I didn't know. ""Do it again and I'll kill yeah pup""

"Nothing turns me on more than women's feet. Most guys go for the tits and/or ass but i loooove the feet! I have my own collection in fact. I like to keep them in pickle jars to preserve them. Some of the larger varieties i had to get creative. I found that removing the heels was the only way for some to fit, which is a shame because i rather enjoy the heels. That's why i tend to favor the smaller ones. Sizes 7 and under are ideal. 

The younger specimens don't have quite as much definition, rather featureless, however the older specimens are far too vascular and wrinkly. Still, a good collection must have some variety. As for the rest of the corpse, i do well enough to properly dispose of them. 

I do have contacts that pay good money for other parts. Some buy arms and legs for consumption, this one guy buys the hands from me quite frequently. There was also this girl who traded me a pair of feet for the face. Just the face. So, after all is said and done i don't usually have as much to dispose of which is nice because a large cooking pot arouses a lot less suspicions than a 55 gallon drum",shortscarystories
"*It all started with a rumor...about a House.*

The House was known by various names, the Puzzle Place, the Labyrinth, the Tangle, the Melgalish Mystery Mansion. It was so incredibly vast and convoluted that no one had ever succeeded in mapping it completely. It was really difficult to map a house that consisted mostly of an infinite number of doors and rooms scattered throughout the known world and universe.

Rumor had it that Melgalish, the wizard who built it, didn't use any blueprints or conventional building material.

""It wasn't built at all,"" people would say. ""He just materialized his dreams into reality.""

""I want to do that,"" twelve-year-old Eliza said one balmy Saturday afternoon in mid-November. ""Just materialize my dreams like that.""

She was at a school-sponsored rummage sale with her seventh-grade sister Karen.

""Idiot,"" Karen said simply. ""You're no more a wizard than I am. You can't use magic--""

""But you want to go too, though, right?""

Karen shut her mouth and shot Eliza a glare. Her younger sister merely grinned up at her. ""I know. You can't resist the idea of getting lost there. You told me before. You love getting lost.  Remember the corn maze last year?""

""Yes, but I'd like to find my way back afterward. Did the others tell you the other rumor?""

""Uh...no.""

Karen sighed as she tidily arranged their mother's baked goods and homemade jellies on their stump table.

""Anyone who would go into that mansion, would get lost, and stay lost.   Sometimes they get forgotten then no one ever looks for them... like they never existed in the first place.""""

""That's impossible."" Eliza snorted.

""The house was made by a wizard materializing his dreams."" Karen scowled. ""Why wouldn't it be possible?""

""If people forgot about the ones who got lost inside, this rumor wouldn't exist in the first place, you see?"" Eliza insisted. ""Maybe someone got out and discovered that everyone's forgotten about him. Or someone still remembers this person who's gone in the mansion, somehow. But that someone would have to be the only one to have remembered, and he discovers that the others don't remember as he does. Or Melgalish spread the rumor, to keep people away--""

""Eliza,"" Karen said firmly, ""do not go into the mansion.  Do not even look for it!""

Eliza continued smiling, still. ""Would you remember, Karen, if I got lost in the mansion?""

""Yes!"" Karen shouted.  Then seeing how people were looking at her strangely, she continued in a husky whisper. ""Because the forgetting curse only affects humans, you'll certainly be missed since you're not of the *Homo sapien* branch.""

Unbeknownst to them, a Gateway lay several dozen paces from where they stood. However, they wouldn't have noticed it anyway because it was cleverly disguised as a large redwood stump.

"He was the only survivor of the fire that consumed his home. Three floors, twenty people, six pets, all burnt to cinders. The family reunion had started off well enough. People who hadn’t seen each other for years and who, in that span of time, had grown bitter, reunited amicably; despite internally blaming each other for the lack of communication. Jason, 25, welcomed them all to his spacious house, calling it a neutral, “starting anew” territory. His parents thought that was very *noble* of him. Jason simply wanted to orchestrate the gathering so that it ran as smoothly as possible. 

At some point a fire broke out. It started seemingly without warning and quickly spread throughout the home; incinerating furniture and people alike. It swept through the house, fed generously on flesh and fabric, cutting off exits and producing suffocating fumes. Jason had been in the kitchen preparing dinner with this mother and aunts when he heard the first screams and smelled the burning flesh. 

As if obtaining some degree of intelligence, the fire attacked the most congested areas, swallowing people in Hadean flames, and setting alight every threshold so that anyone attempting to pass through would be set aflame. Jason and the women tried to exit the kitchen, but the flames quickly denied them passage, and forced them into a corner, near the window above the sink. Jason directed them to it, and helped them mount the sink and climb through.  

Once they had made their way out the window, he too mounted the sink, but ceased his efforts when he saw the stones of the patio beyond the window glow molten red, then burst forth; spewing hellish pillars of fire. The escaping women were immediately consumed by the spires of flame—their forms instantly charred, then destroyed; rendered to wind-scattered ash.  

Jason, trapped and beyond terrified, sank to the tiled floor. Sweat poured from his face, and the heat brought a delirium upon him. He lost consciousness as the smoke took residence in his lungs, and the flames danced across his flesh. The day, obviously, hadn’t gone according to plan.  

He awoke in the back of an ambulance, an oxygen mask affixed tightly to his face, and an EMT treating some superficial burns on his shoulder. Beyond, a team of firefighters combated the mighty conflagration that consumed his house; spewing torrents of water at the sinister blaze.  

The next few hours passed by him as a series of images, and ended with him regaining proper awareness on a hospital bed. A doctor stood over him, clipboard in hand, and greeted him kindly. They discussed the fire, and Jason expressed his ignorance as to how it had started. What he didn’t say, what brought him a subsequent guilt, was that he was somewhat relieved that it had occurred. His family was a contentious bunch, and even with the loss of his house, he was glad to be rid of them. ",shortscarystories
"  This happened early last year. one day myself, my wife &amp; daughter had come home late in the evening from a movie. As usual we had left our mobiles on the table in living room. I was in the balcony, my wife went in kitchen &amp; my daughter went in her room. Suddenly my phone began to ring. I went to take the call &amp; to my surprise the call was from my daughter’s phone number which was on the table beside my phone. While my phone was still ringing all of a sudden my wife’s phone also started ringing &amp; as I checked it I was shocked to see it too was from my daughters same number and her phone was untouched lying in front of me.

  Imagine a situation where both your phones are getting call at the same time from the same phone which was lying just in front of you untouched. This was scary. I took the calls but there was no response neither on my phone nor on my wife's phone. As soon I disconnected I checked my daughters phone to find there was no record of any outgoing call in the call logs. This gave me creeps.

 I didn’t disclose to them what had happened.

  Even if we consider that just in case my daughter had prescheduled an auto call to me ( Don’t know if it’s possible but just considering that can be done) how was it possible that the same number can also give a call to my wife’s phone at the same time &amp;with no call log. Also if someone would have made duplicate sim of her number in that matter her actual sim would've have become inactive however her sim is very much active &amp; is in use till date.

"“Did you run away, too?”


It was another six year old. She held a little candle. 


“Yes.” I had run away that morning. Daddy had been throwing bottles and was being mean again.  


“There’s a place where all run away children go.” 


“Really? Where is it? What’s it like?”


“I’ll answer on the way. And I’m Alice.”


“I’m William.”   


Even though girls had cooties, I was happy to follow. The woods were a little less spooky with her candle. The rain had soaked through my coziest jacket. My fingers and feet felt like popsicles. Even though Alice just had a white dress, she didn’t seem to notice the cold.


“No grown ups besides our Protector. He has one big eye and arms as wide as tree trunks.”


“He sounds like a monster!”


“But he’s a nice monster. Every few months, we give him something. An old teddy bear or a few scraps of dinner.”


“That’s all?” 


“Yes.” 


“It’s a happy place,” she went on, “a thousand different toys, warm food, cozy beds, and dessert first. Everyone’s nice.”


Just imagining that made me happy. In kindergarten, everyone called me poopy head because I had brown hair. And some nights, when Mommy was very sad, we wouldn’t have anything to eat, much less something warm. 


Eventually, we reached  a little wooden house.


I went on my tippy toes and peeked in.


There were so many toys. More than I could ever count. The trucks and action figures gleamed like new. No missing parts. All the teddies were soft and fluffy. In the far corner, a few black cauldrons bubbled. My mouth watered for the yummy soup. The cabin was lit by torches and candles, making everything look warm and soft. A few kids looked up, waved, and smiled.


I smiled back. 


I walked over to the door but Alice stopped me. 


“You need this.” she tied a rope around my wrist.


“What’s this?”


“Oh, you’ll… you’ll see. It’s a surprise.”


Alice pulled a curtain over the window. Everything went black.


My knees turned to jelly when something growled behind me.


I looked back. A big green eyeball blinked at me. A huge hand reached out.


“Alice! Alice!”


I tried to run, but it only made the rope tighter. It dug into my wrist.


“I’m sorry! I’m sorry William!” she cried, “but the Protector… he… he isn’t happy with broken barbies anymore.”


The giant covered my mouth with a finger, cutting off my screams. He lifted me up.


“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, William.” Alice sobbed and cried over and over. But I hardly heard her.


Home. A place where Mommy and Daddy weren’t sad and angry anymore. A place where it was warm and safe and everyone was nice. I reached out my hand. Maybe if I reached out far enough, I could get in.


But a second later, the giant turned a corner and the cabin was gone.",shortscarystories
"As I drove towards the Christmas tree cutting spot with the rest of my extended family behind my car, I think about the time of year.

Christmas is always rough for me. My dad disappeared while cutting a Christmas tree 15 years ago. 

I miss him.

Not only is this a trip to get a Christmas tree, I want to try and find him.

I knew this was crazy. It was 15 years ago. He was surely dead. But u had a little flicker of hope that he survived.

As soon as we got there, we set up camp and made some soup. We always did this before we got a tree, and why break tradition?

To stay safe, all people cutting a tree goes in a group of 4. I was put in a group with my Uncle Matthew, Aunt Paula, and Oldest son, Henry.

After finding a good and stable pine tree, I felt unnerved for some reason. As if being watched. Or maybe being followed.

Henry also felt what I was feeling, so he pushed me to just get it over with, and so I start hacking away at it.

Soon, it fell down, and I started to pick it up. But cutting that tree was my mistake.

A loud screech roared out of nowhere, and attacked my aunt. It tore her flesh open and ate her organs. 

Frightened, the rest of us started running back to camp. Regrettably, we went deep in to find a good tree, and so we got lost quickly.

We stopped at a log and rested for a second. My uncle was freaking out, understandably I may add. He just saw his wife get torn up by a creature.

After about a minute, we started back looking for camp. Like I said, we went in deep, too deep.

After about 5 hours of walking, we found our camp, but it wasn't a fun sight.

The bodies of my family were strewn about the entire camp.

My youngest was crisped in the fire, my wife was gutted, and worst of all, my grandfather was hacked into tiny bits. And the rest were either slashed, bitten, or just missing.

Soon after, the creature arrived.

It was about 7 feet tall with the head of a deer's skull, a torso that was covered in something that I can only describe as a cloak of leaves, it's hands were claws, painted read with blood, and the feet were also claws, except they were shorter, sharper.

It then came at us with a sprint.

It snatched up Henry and bit his head off, then tossing his body aside.

He then went for Uncle Matthew, tearing off some arm flesh before I started hacking into it with my axe. 

It blead out black blood, and collapsed into the snow, dead.

I helped Matthew up, and ran too my truck. We drove away fast, with a new fear if the woods.

I thought as I drove. And I realized that my father was killed by that creature.

My father told me of a story about a creature in that forest before. He called it the pine, and was obsessed with it.

I am now a schoolboy. I wake up early in the morning and fake being sick. I skip school to go on long walks. I watch the beetles, the butterflies and the lotuses. I skip stones on the lake. I climb the ancient structure. I slip. *It's nothing to worry about, he'll be up in no time*, I hear.


I am now a lover. I meet her at the morning recess. She's beautiful, tall and smart. We go out and watch theatre, go to the park and to the fair. I send her love letters. I understand her and she understands me. She tells me she loves me. *I'm not ready for this.*


I am now a soldier. I take months of training in the scorching noon sun. I am bold, adventurous and fearless. I am angry, young and confident. I fight valiantly for my country. I win wars and then medals. My parents say, *we're proud of you.*


I am now a Justice. My lovely wife makes me savoury lunch. I am finally prosperous and successful. I am respected, honest and wise. I am a faithful husband and father of three kids. I start to enjoy the finer details of life. *I look forward to the rest of my life.*


I am now an old man. I watch the sun set from my porch. I read the newspaper and pray to God. I try to remain optimistic in life. Though my wife left me, I love my three little kids. They have to go to college now. *They silently kiss me and let go.*


*I am now senile. I patiently wait for the day to end. I can't walk or speak. I am riddled with ailments. My friends brought flowers for me. They hug me. Living these seven ages is all I asked for. One is all I got. I watched my parents as they pulled the plug on me with tears in their eyes.*",shortscarystories
"A phenomenon has taken hold of the Chiyoda ward of Tokyo, especially around the area of Akihabara. 

Utaukaze, or “Singing Wind”, is often heard by tourists visiting the various otaku-oriented shops in the city. The sound is described as a low, almost inaudible voice humming or vocalizing. Victims compare it to an idol’s singing. 

In fact, the phenomenon has been known to mimic the latest hit song by the victim’s favorite artist. Regardless of who that artist might be. 

While not inherently dangerous, Utaukaze could result in the victim becoming distracted, and falling into perilous situations.",shortscarystories
"I live in a small town in rural appalachia. The entire area was heavily settled by Irish immigrants over 150 years ago. They brought along their traditions, superstitions and folklore, and well, a few other things followed along as well.
 
As a child me and the neighbor boy Mike used to go down and play in the creek together. It was our favorite past time. We would catch minnows and crawdads, build little dams with rocks and mud and swim in some of the deeper pools. We used to spend every summer like this, that is, until the summer we both turned twelve.
 
It was a hot June day and we had been swimming in a deep pool that lies a couple miles downstream from our houses. When it turned evening time we started the long walk back. We were deep in conversation when we came around a bend in the creek and sitting there on a boulder beside the water was a small, beautiful woman. She was wearing an emerald green dress covered by a grey cloak. Her hair was incredibly long and she was brushing it with a silver brush.
 
We both froze and stared. We knew everyone who lived along the creek and neither one of us had seen her before. Her beauty was stunning. After a minute or two but what seemed like an eternity, she looked up at us. Her appearance immediately changed, soft and smooth white skin seemed to melt into grey lumpy clay. Her beautiful face now looked more like a half rotted corpse and her long, luscious hair fell off in clumps. And then this dead thing began to wail the most blood curdling and awful sound that I have ever heard.
 
We took off running and ran all the way to my Mike’s house. When we arrived we found his mother sobbing uncontrollably and she looked pale as a ghost. She informed us that Mike’s father, a mechanic by trade, had been working under a car when one of the jack stands had given way. His head was crushed and he died instantly.
 
Mike and his mother moved away a few months after that. I haven’t seen him or talked to him since then, though I often think back on this day. Mike’s family name was O’Brien and mine is O’Neill, as an adult I’ve started doin a lot of research on my Irish family heritage and I happened to come across old legends of the Banshee. It is said that each of the original families of Ireland had their own Banshee, a form of the fae that would herald the death of a family member with her awful wailing or keening.
 
And then yesterday, as I sat on my back porch sipping on my whiskey, I heard the most blood curdling and awful sound. That I’ve heard once before.",shortscarystories
"It started with Robert Johnson. He sold his soul to the Devil for musical talent. The Devil came for him at 27. He always pays his debts and he always collects the debts owed to him.

Many people throughout the years have done the same. Brian Jones. Jimi Hendrix. Janis Joplin. Jim Morrison. Kurt Cobain. Amy Winehouse. They all sold their souls for fame, only to die at 27 so Satan could collect his dues. The method may differ—drowning, drug overdose, heart failure, suicide—but they always died before their 28th birthday.

I’ve managed to avoid that fate so far. I’m hoping that if I’m alive once the clock strikes midnight tonight, my 28th birthday, I’ll be free.

I was so stupid. I was 16, a little bit drunk, and I poured my heart out to a stranger I met on a walk in a field near my house. I wanted to be famous. Get out of my small town living. I’d been taking guitar and voice lessons but I felt like I’d never be good enough to make something of myself.

“I think I can help,” the stranger told me. “But on one condition.”

“Which is?” I was wary, but the alcohol was dulling my judgement.

“You’ll become everything you ever wanted to be….but your soul belongs to me.”

In my drunken state I just assumed this was a crazy person talking. I chuckled and replied, “Sure, okay.” We shook on it and I then turned around and walked home.

The following week, I was discovered by an agent who saw a video I’d put out on YouTube. I skyrocketed to fame almost overnight.

It took a few months for me to realize that I may have actually made a deal with the Devil. I searched for a way out, but never found one. I did eventually discover the 27 Club and realized that was likely my fate.

Eventually he began to appear everywhere. It was subtle, but enough to remind me of my debt. I might see him in my reflection, only to turn and see I was alone. I saw him on a train once when I was at the station, but it pulled away from me and he vanished.

I haven’t seen him at all in over a year. I’m beginning to wonder if I got off scot-free. He has plenty of other people to worry about, right? Surely he’s forgotten about the drunk teenager he made a deal with over a decade ago.

I check the clock. It’s ten minutes to midnight. Maybe I managed to get out of this.

As I begin to head to bed, I am startled by a loud knock on the door, followed by it creaking open. And immediately, I know who it is. The Devil always keeps his promises. Always.",shortscarystories

"""We need to talk about the kid."" Mom speaks to Dad.

Billy is sitting between his father and mother, thinking that it's unusual for Mom to talk in such a monotonous tone. He doesn't say a word, because he has learnt over the years that it is not a wise choice to talk when Mom and Dad are talking. In fact, not to talk at all is the only wise choice for Billy in this household.

""What?"" Dad expresses his lack of patience in just one word. Dad is always good at expressing anger, sometimes by words and sometimes by fists, seasoned with a belt whip or two.

“And occasionally by a pair of Oxfords if Dad miraculously gets a job interview that day!” Billy thinks to himself, almost bursts out into laughter. It’s an unusual sense of humor for a 16-year-old boy to have, but Billy’s life is never usual and he has also been through a lot more than a 16-year-old should’ve had.

""Don't what me! If you had spent more time with the kid, I wouldn't been called to the principal's room again!""

""Oh! So it's my fault now that the kid is running around school breaking stuff? Hurting other students?"" Dad's voice is getting louder with every word.

Billy wants to tell them his name is Billy and not ""the kid,” but he restrains this urge to avoid the beating he will get if he opens his mouth. He forgets he won’t be beaten again. Not anymore.

“Of course it’s your fault! I’m always the one that puts foods on the table! What have you done for this family?”

Normally, Dad will fire back with another insult then begins to beat up Mom, just another Wednesday night in Billy’s home. But that is not happening, because Billy is bored of role-playing now.

He withdraws his hands from his parents’ cold lips, his thumbs are sore from arching up and down constantly trying to make their mouths move. Billy rests his back against the chair and gazes at what is in front of him, as if he is looking at the greatest piece of art he has ever seen before.

His parent lie in their chairs, arms draping like broken branches toward the ground. There are little streams of dried blood on Dad’s left arm, they come from the gash on his throat cut open earlier with a steak knife by Billy. Mom doesn’t have much blood on her body because the fork is still buried deep inside her neck.

For the first time in his life, Billy feels relieved. He feels free. He decides to do something only grown-ups are allowed to do in this house.

"The trees rustled in the dry winters wind. The overcast day set the perfect ambiance for my hunt. The last hunt had left me unsatisfied, so I had pushed my normal waiting time. And the importance of my prey. It didn't matter however. It was all irrelevant, the carrion birds, the voices. Irrelevant. I was in the woods now. I had the police chief's daughter as my newest prey. My newest treasure. 


I tracked her prints and listened to the ambience. But something was wrong. The birds didn't chirp. The only sound that could be heard was the wind. The voices in my head, my primal hunter was silent. It was never silent. My every kill, it spoke. Every move, it spoke. Now it felt like I was hunted.


I shook off my doubts. Doubts were for the weak. I was the New York skinner. This was my twenty eighth kill. My confidence refused to return as I got closer. I found that last print. My prey was nowhere to be found. A shoe ahead was the only trace of her. I looked at it and nocked an arrow. Whatever had stolen my kill had to be close.


I kept walking the direction the shoe was facing. I walked until I found prints again. My theory was correct. It was false. My prey must have found a spare shoe and tried to throw me off. I proudly followed the trail. Until I was back in the clearing, with the same shoe. But now there was something carved into a nearby tree: ‘Not the hunter’. I screamed and shot the tree. Someone was toying with me. Someone would pay. I had gotten turned around in the eerie silence, it wouldn't happen again. 


I turned to look for any memorable marks in the space behind me, what I saw chilled me to the bone. A set of footprints, a foot behind me. No one was there, no tracks lead away. My fear skyrocketed. How had this happened? I decided to live to hunt another day.


I was halfway back to my car. As I was running I saw that every tree was carved in. I felt sick, and then a knife jabbed into my back. I fell to my knees. As I tried to pull the knife out, another one lodged itself in my throat. The crows would find my body, and my skins of my victims. The skins of dead humans, 28 of them. As I faded to nothing I felt utter fear, the New York skinner would finally be caught.",shortscarystories
"I fucking hate clowns.

They frighten me more than you can imagine.

I had seen the movies, read the comics and I know how much the Media tends to exaggerate the creepiness of them but still.

I know that not all clowns are serial killing space spiders, or maniacs obsessed with spreading Chaos.

But damn, those smiles.

They freak me out more than they should.

So when I encountered a clown making his way towards my home I fucking freaked out.

I had been making my way home myself, I just came back from a late night gaming session with my best friend from school when I saw him.

The clown wore a classic clown suit and had white make up with the classic red nose and smile but the similarities with a normal clown stopped there.

This clown was covered in blood, it was dripping from his mouth down his suit.

The clown smiled at me when I yelped.

He turned his face towards me and I got a good look at him, which made it all the worse.

There was no smile painted on his face, instead he had a large gap in his cheek in the rough form of a smile.

The image of raw cut flesh still haunts me to this day.

He saw me and tried to reach out for me, stepping forward and making a screeching sound.

I managed to act and I managed to kick him in the kidney.

He fell back and more blood gulped down his face, all the while that haunting smile was plastered on my face.

I fucking ran.

It was not until the next morning that I learned about what happened.

And the truth was horrifying.

A serial killer struck yesterday, causing a slaughter at a nearby circus.

The killer in particular had a weird thing for carving smiles in the faces of his victims.

When I heard this I froze, realizing that the clown was not a monster but a victim, reaching out for help.

But it wasn’t until the police came by that the true horror struck.

I first thought that they were going to arrest me for assaulting the clown yesterday.

But they were not there for me.

Instead they came to talk about my brother.

My brother who never came back from his job appliance at the local circus.",shortscarystories
"Mariela believed in ghosts.

She had grown up on warnings of La Llorona and El Coco, and her grandmother always swore the spirit of a nurse had saved her life once. As long as she could remember, she’d believed such otherworldly things existed.

So she wasn’t surprised when a low moaning drifted through her window one night. Not surprised, but terrified all the same. The cries raised in volume and pitch, sobbing, then screaming.

Mariela huddled under her blanket, too frightened to move. Only her eyes peeked out, glued to the window. 

Don’t come here, she pleaded silently. Please don’t come here.

Lightning flashed, illuminating a white face pressed against the glass. Its dark hair hung ragged, its mouth poured blood, and its black eyes locked with hers.

Mariela fainted.



She woke early the next morning, exhausted but alive. Too many scary movies, she thought as she buttered a slice of toast. In the warm light of the sunrise, she easily dismissed the previous night as a dream, munching her breakfast contentedly.

Until sirens tore through the quiet morning, red and blue lights flashing outside.

The pounding on the door brought back her terror. She let the police officers in, her last bite of toast going down like gravel.

Yes, she believed in ghosts, but the words the officers spoke were somehow less believable.

“...the victim…”

“...tongue cut out…”

“...found outside your home, ma’am…”

(I havnt had a nightmare since I was 5 so this makes no since to me,)my body is always numb like I'm in sleep peralisis for like 20 seconds but I've never been prone to that kind of thing. The same thing happens when I try to go to sleep. Sometimes my bones hurt too and my legs feel like they're being pulled from my own body.

When I'm paranoid,I'm paranoid that I'm gonna forget some one or something and that if there was something in the shadows or merged with the wall I wouldn't see it and my eye get really wide trying my best to see something the wall or shadows. And when I do think I see something i start looking for a weapon for no reason. I've never had irrational fears so this is really out of character. For convenience I've started keeping a pair of scissors by my bed.

Sound wise when i hear the slightest bit of noise it will  make my heart race and make my breath quicken. And all of the sudden my voice is gone for a second so i can't scream. Then I start rambling to my self,without trying. Like I'm not in control of my muscles and mind. I basicly start acting like a maniac who found his ex's house. 

When I can feel again it's like I can feel every  hair on my body and it starting to stick up and crawl off of me,like tiny little crabs. The scrapes on my arms and legs feel like they are tearing open and bleeding when they are perfectly fine. My nails feel like peeling off and my feet start wobling side to side.

"“Just a minute Honey!” he called out from downstairs… He was still shaking and sweating profusely… This was the closest he had ever come to getting caught. He pulled up his pants, smoothing out the wrinkles, gave his ex a final look and whispered “Sorry hun… I gotta run.. hope you understand.” 

He raced upstairs hoping and praying that his fiancée Anita wouldn’t smell his ex on him. Women had an unusually keen sense of smell when it came to other women, especially exes. He wished he had more time, enough for a quick shower, but that would surely raise suspicions and he might wake his mother.

Anita didn’t seem to notice as she kissed him deeply. He wasn’t sure why he kept things going with his ex. Sneaking her in though the side basement door for just “one last time.” This is the last time, he would think after every occasion, mentally kicking himself for not being stronger. Constantly afraid that his mother or fiancée would catch them. One look into his Anita’s eyes and he could see the love and affection. He didn’t see that anymore with his ex it was more primal urges and craving now.

“We’ll have to be quiet… We don’t want to wake mother.” he whispered as they slipped out the door. “I appreciate you taking me to the cosmetologist, it’s so hard to find makeup that compliments my tone… It’s a very unusual but exceptionally thoughtful gift!” she said looking up into his eyes. “Anything for you my love.” He replied, admiring the gleam in her eyes. 

“When will I get to meet your mother? The wedding is approaching fast.” She asked as they walked away from the house. He thought about it for some time before responding “You know she’s very ill… She might not even make it to the wedding date.” Anita turned him to face her saying “All the more reason I should meet her soon. Please honey… You promised!”

Sighing deeply, he replied “Alright… Soon… I promise!” It was a promise he knew he would have to keep despite the consequences. Soon enough Anita would meet his mother. Only then she would realize that his mother’s sickness was of the mind rather than the body. She would realize too late, just like his ex had, that his mother would only allow one love in her only child’s life.

He wondered if the love would leave her eyes as quickly it had with each of his exes. It seemed to be the first thing to go, the light from the eyes followed by the glow of the skin. He could preserve the other features of her body, but those seemed to be the two elements that escaped his abilities. 

He took another deep look into his fiancées eyes and studied them. Carefully examining the light of life and love, trying to memorize it for the next set of glass eyes from the taxidermy shop.",shortscarystories
"Death slowly walks across the street. 

A man exits his house still clad in his pajamas. Yawning, he shuffles onto the porch and picks up the paper. Death looks at the small clock above his head. It reads 17 years. Nope. Not today. 

The door of the next house opens. An old lady. Her clock reads 1 minute and 13 seconds. Patiently, Death waits until the number winds down. On cue, the old woman trips on her way to get her paper. She lands on her head, a motion accompanied by a ""crrrrck"" as her neck twists halfway around. 

Death approaches the old lady. ""Come with me."" The old lady gets up and follows. 

Continuing on her path, she spies a dog. It whines pitifully, begging for food it doesn't receive. It collapses, no longer having strength to stand. Patiently, Death watches its clock wind. 

She scratches the dog behind the ears. ""Come with me."" The dog follows, tail wagging. 

""Come along,"" she says to the homeless man. 

""Follow me,"" to the man who just plummeted from the roof. 

Near the coffee shop, Death patiently waits for the clock of an elderly man to hit zero. After a 16 minute and 48 second wait, he clutches his chest and collapses in line. She follows as paramedics come and put him into an ambulance, performing emergency procedures all the while. 6 minutes and 12 seconds later, she has another addition to her parade. 

A good days work, she thinks. Turning, she sees a group of children playing. Innocence. Beauty. Hope. Life. She stops to soak in the laughter. 

Wait. 

Something's not right. 

The little girl catches the ball, the epitome of youth. But her clock is plummeting. 78 years. 70 years. 64 years. Death frowns. This wasn't on the agenda for today. 

""Ruth!"" Comes a harsh yell. ""Enough playing, c'mere!"" Death turns to see an unkempt man calling from a rundown house across the street. 

The young girl looks back but continues playing. 

""Get over here you ungrateful piece of shit,"" the man snarls from the doorway. 

Reluctantly, the little girl waves to her friends and runs across the street.

Death watches the car coming. The clock winds down. 56 years. 33 years. 

With a honk that fades with distance, the car veers, narrowly avoiding the little girl. 

Death stands frozen as the clock continues ticking down.

""RUTH!"" The grizzled man shouts, the stench of alcohol smothering his breath.

Death follows the girl into the house; her followers wait outside. Bottles are strewn around and furniture lies in shambles. 22 years. 16 years.

Death slowly turns back to watch the man and little girl.

Our arms were ash. Covered in dirt, bruises and wounds. Each of us were in it for a reason. A share. The boys would often get into fights and arguments over the shares allowed from any gold we found on the job. Johnny? Needed money for surgery. 

Bill? Money for house debt. 

Clive ? Drug addiction. 

Despite the rows it was easy for us to get the job done knowing the reward required teamwork.

We all had our reasons to be digging the same hole for weeks on end, hours after hours. Days after days. Chipping and chipping until our fingers bled with the ever-present visions of what the next piece would offer us. How it would make our lives that bit easier. That but more pleasurable. 

It had been over a month when it started to get so deep that daylight was now vague. The sun fading into a dull haze. It was dark now. It didn’t stop us. We continued to collect the fragments of gold in our own little self made tunnel. 



But last night was different. 


The light had gone now as had the others. I sat and chipped at the end alone. Sweat pouring down my dirt ridden skin. The thought of my wife and children keeping me sane as the hours passed.

So I sit in the middle of the dimly lit room, shivering, but not because of the cold. I see a shapeless man enter the room, silent as a mouse. He is not fat, yet not thin, not handsome but not ugly. He sits down next to me. I close my eyes, trying to resist the urge to recoil. Though the man is nothing to look at, I can feel his power, his confidence. “Open your eyes,” he commands. I do so, and find myself staring into them. His eyes. Filled with an emotion beyond my understanding, not hateful, not friendly, but something in between, as distant and alien as the stars in which They came from. He stares into mine, silent, gauging my worth. He pulls out a device, and looks down, and then quickly types something into it. Then, calmly, he tells me, “I have judged your worth. You’re coming with me back to my planet.” A million forbidden questions pop into my head. I wonder if I was drafted into their army to smite their distant enemies, or if not, what else I will have to do to help them win their upcoming war.  

As if he knows what I’m thinking, the man says, “You may look at your results. But don’t expect to understand them. They were written in our tongue.” I don’t tell him that I learned Their language by listening to the soldiers that were always stationed near our home. He turns his hand to me, I look at the small device in his palm. I barely make out the words:

"It was a week before Christmas. The children's wing at St. Jude's was packed as usual. Most of the children were excited about the toys and gifts they'd be receiving; however, some were scared this might be their last Christmas. This sad reality weighed heavily on the mind of Susan. She wiped away the tears as she tried to fall asleep, clutching teddy tight.

The next morning, as Susan was being transported down to the basement, she was passed by Thomas, a newly admitted patient to the PICU. Reaching out to Susan's bed, Thomas grabbed teddy and held it close. The nurses exchanged a heavy nod and kept walking.

Three days later, Thomas' pneumonia got the best of him but teddy was there with him the whole way. Thomas was sent down to the basement; teddy back to the children's wing.

A few days before Christmas, the nurses were collecting letters for Santa. When asked for his letter, Kevin shook his head. He had teddy. After all, teddy had brought him and others so much comfort and joy. Kevin wrote no letter to Santa and by the next morning, it wouldn't matter anyway.

It was Christmas Eve. The children's wing was full of life. After visits from Santa and his elves, the children were tired and eager to go to bed. Jessie snuggled teddy gently to sleep.

Later that night, Jessie awoke to a strange inhaling sound. She was confused by it but growing sleepier and sleepier. The inhaling sound grew more aggressive, like someone taking deep, purposeful breaths. Jessie fell deeper into sleep. That was when Nick awoke and saw teddy on top of her.

The nurses rushed to the children's wing. By the time they arrived, they were shocked to see all the children upright in their beds; all except Jessie. They reassured the children Jessie was simply going downstairs for a routine exam but Nick knew better. After what he saw, he knew they'd never see Jessie again. The rest of the children fell back asleep while Nick stayed awake, shuddering in fear.

It was Christmas. All the children were laughing and playing with their new toys. Seeing Nick finally rouse in his bed, one nurse rushed over to greet him, plopping something small and fluffy on his lap. He gasped to find teddy with a wide, hungry smile on its face. Nick started to scream but quickly lost the will. He watched in sleepy horror as his life force drained from his lips in rich, youthful wisps and into the mouth and body of the hand-me-down teddy. Running out of time and strength, he gripped teddy's body and pulled its head clean off, spilling white stuffing everywhere.

Nick awoke the next morning in the recovery room, surrounded by a few nurses. They all comforted him and wished him well. One nurse stepped forward and handed him something. His heart dropped when he saw its wide, hungry smile.

""Look, Nick. Good as new!""",shortscarystories
"""Ellie,"" a voice whispered.

She stirred, her brow knitting in consternation.

""Wake up, Ellie."" More forceful this time, a boy's voice insisted. He sat in the hospital chair next to her bed.

Ellie opened her eyes, slowly. The cancer made it hard to do much more than this; lesioned bones aching at the slightest movement.

""Hi Ellie,"" the boy smiled. Moussy, brown hair dampened his forehead above dimpled cheeks. He couldn't have been more than seven, about her age.

""Who are you?"" She muttered, weakly. Her hair long since lost to the failed chemotherapy.

""I came to help you.""

""Where are my mum and dad?""

""I let them sleep for a little while, so we could talk."" The boy's smile only grew.

""Do I know you?"" She whispered.

""No, but I came to help.""

""What do you mean?""

""You won't feel any more pain. I'm here to take you away."" Something about the boy's words felt final. Ellie could feel her pain beginning to slip away almost immediately, her strength growing moment by moment.

""Are you an angel?"" She asked, her eyes filled with wonder.

""Something like that,"" he laughed standing up. He walked towards the door, beckoning. Ellie sat up but felt no more pain. Tenderly, she put weight on her feet and gasped as she stood up after being bedridden for so long.

""We should go before the others come.""

""What others?""

""Don't worry about them, I'll protect you.""

Outside they turned a corner and found her mum and dad curled up on one of the sofas, asleep.

""Can I say goodbye?"" Ellie pleaded, pulling at the boy's hand. Tears filled her eyes.

""Okay,"" he relented.

Ellie walked over to her mother, quietly. She reached down and stroked her face.

""Goodbye, mama."" Ellie cried softly.

""Ellie..."" Her mother mumbled, half-asleep.

""We have to go now. They'll be okay. I promise.""

Suddenly a sound rang out, distant but distinct. Trumpets.

""The bad ones are coming, we have to go"" the boy implored, fearfully.

The trumpets sounded a little closer.

Ellie took one last look at her parents, tears falling down her cheeks.

""Please don't forget me,"" she whispered to them. Ellie grabbed the boy's hand again.

At the end of the hall he stopped by a door, pulling out a large, ornate key.

""Are we going to heaven now?"" Ellie asked.

""Somewhere even better, I promise. It's where all the special children go.""

He unlocked the door, light suddenly pouring through the crack underneath and the keyhole. He opened it, drenching them in blinding sunlight.

""Just step into the light, Ellie."" He shouted over the now deafening trumpets, the door and walls shaking in trepidation at the imminent arrival of something otherworldly.

Ellie hesitated for a moment. She cast one last look at the boy. He smiled at her, kindly and she stepped through.

The boy sighed deeply before letting a terrible laugh curse his lips.

The purest souls always tasted the sweetest. 

He followed Ellie into the light.",shortscarystories

"Ever heard of the Tooth Fairy? Of course you have. She's everywhere. Everyone knows that if you lose a tooth and slip it under your pillow your parents will come in the dead of night and replace it with money claiming it was the ever mysterious Tooth Fairy. Seems harmless and innocent, right? Wrong.

Ever wondered how a myth like the Tooth Fairy came to be? I mean a story about a fairy who collects fallen teeth in the night doesn't simply pop out of existence because it didn't. But the thing from which the Tooth Fairy sprang from is much more dangerous than the one who leaves behind money for good little children. I'm talking about the **Teeth Eater.**

The Teeth Eater has been around for as long as humans have. Nobody knows where it came from. We just know what it does. The victims of the Teeth Eater are found with their jaws ripped open and each tooth plucked and pulled out of the child's mouth, one by one until their mouth is a bleeding mess of stumps and gum. Then the creature uses its extremely long fingers, designed for plucking teeth, to reach down the child's throat, effectively choking the them to death.

If you want to know what it does with the teeth then all you got to do is look at the name. Some say she eats them. Others say she sticks them into her own toothless gums so she can eat herself. I say both. It honestly depends on whether or not you've been a good boy, brushing your teeth everyday. If you didn't then you'll probably regret not listening to mommy and daddy because if your teeth are shiny and healthy, she'll pluck them out and keep them as her own teeth, pushing them inside her gums making her fangs seem uneven and misshaped, but if your teeth are rotting then so are you. In those cases she will use her previous victim's teeth to eat you alive. She repeats this until her current teeth become rotten or broken, then she finds a new set.

Some say she comes in the form of a lady in a white dress. Others say she is in the form of an emaciated and shrivelled black body with a huge mouth and sunken, hollow eyes with rotten hair.

As for how I know all this? Trust me. You'd be surprised how much time you have on your hands when you can only consume quick and fast liquids. All I want is for nobody else to fall to my mistakes. The way you invite her into your home and into your mouth is a mistake most people make when they're young and have loose teeth. Do not grind your teeth against each other or swirl around the loose tooth in its gums. The sounds attract her to what she sees as a shiny new set of teeth to add to either her collection or her stomach...",shortscarystories
"“Sacred Family Elementary was built over the site of a World War II munitions factory,” Principal John Raik explained. “One night, a live tank round rolled into a box of hand grenades. The explosion shattered the windows of the church down the block. One hundred sixty-three people died. The church purchased the property from the town, and built a school where the workers’ children could attend, free of charge. I’d like to close the basement but our enrollment dictates those classrooms are needed. Nothing school-related takes place in the basement past 4:00pm.”

“Remember,” Raik continued, “do not speak to them. They pose no threat to you as long as you don’t engage them in conversation. I want you to repeat, ‘just us two’. We are the only two people in the building. No matter what you see down there, understand?”

Will nodded hesitantly.

Based on the movies he’d seen, Will expected horribly disfigured ghouls. Other than the outdated clothing, they looked...normal. He repeated over and over, ‘just us two’, as Raik had commanded. 

The entities scuttled in and out of rooms and walls silently. Raik opened a closet to reveal a mop. “After the classrooms are cleaned, the hallway must be wet-mopped once a week,” Raik led Will back to the office.

Will worked for one month. He started in the basement immediately after school, before anything appeared. He couldn’t see them but definitely felt them. Student artwork hanging in the hallway would move. A drawing fell to the floor, picked itself up, and secured itself back to the wall. Whenever Will felt compelled to run he repeated, “just me, just me.”

Then, Will’s car died. It was 7:15pm when he got to the basement that was silently buzzing with activity, as it was when Principal Raik showed him why he was the highest paid janitor in the county. 

Will grabbed the mop, the spirits moved around him, not taking any interest. 

Distracted about his car, Will forgot the only rule of the basement. A man in a faded military uniform walked past Will lighting a cigarette. “Careful buddy, wet floor,” Will said.

The entity stopped. Will realized his mistake. Will looked around and saw them all staring at him.

Will’s heart raced and he ran towards the stairs in a panicked sprint. Will slipped on the wet floor. He turned to face them. They crowded over Will. He screamed and they were on him. 

Will sat up and heard a man giving a static speckled speech on an old radio. He heard machines whirring and conversations. He heard the *click-clack* of high heels on cement. The man in the military attire squatted down next him with a smile and offered a gold case, “Cigarette?”

Will saw Raik with someone by the mop closet. He jumped up and ran to them. He yelled and waved his arms. They didn’t make a sound or acknowledge him. He could read their lips. “*Just us two.*”",shortscarystories
"Nick sighed as he turned to look at his lover. ""We can't do this anymore, Oz."" He said on a firm, cold voice.

Oz stared at the boy, momentarily dumbfounded by the words, before scoffing. ""So after everything that we've been through, you're just calling it quits like that?"" He replied in an acidic tone. Nick remained silent, and so he continued to rant;

""Is this all because your parents don't want us together?"" He askek, before laughing humorlessly, ""Do you really think they give a fuck about your wellbeing? They're just worried we'll make them look bad, you know. You should hear what they say about us when you aren't arou-""

""I don't care what they think!"" Nick shouted, cutting him off. ""I care about what's best for me, and that's being away from you.""

Oz approached him smiling, but clearly aggravated. ""You think you know what's best for you?"" He asked, ""Oh please, before you found me you were nothing. I was the one who was there for you when you needed it, I *made* you.""

""You took advantage of me!"" Nick shot back with equal amounts venom. ""I gave you every part of me; my heart, my soul, my *body*. But you never gave a fuck about me."" Tears of frustration running down his face, he breathed deeply before continuing; ""I found out about all the other guys you've seen before me, you know; how you'd promise to love them forever if they let you in, then you suck them dry and leave. Well you aren't getting me. Piss off.""

Oz stood in silence for a moment, as if unsure of how to react to the telling off, before his face contorted into an expression of pure rage. In a flash, he grabbed the smaller man's neck with one hand and raised him upward, attempting to squeeze the life out of him.

""So you think you're so special huh?"" He asked, his voice now dropping into an inhumanly low pitch, ""You think you're strong enough to walk away from me? I'll tell you right now that you aren't, and the second you let your guard down I'll be right back here to make your life a living hell. Because you know what you are? Nothing but a weak little fagg-""

Nick shot up from his bed with a gasp, and took a moment to catch his breath before staring up at the people surrounding him; his parents and an exorcist.

""Is it- Is it gone?"" His mother squeaked.

Nick sat in silence as he assessed his body. For the first time in ages he felt completely in control. ""Yeah,"" he replied, smiling weakly, ""I think so.""

With that, his parents embraced one another as the exorcist gave prayer. Nick fell back into the bed in exhaustion. He knew, in the back of his mind, that the demon probably wouldn't give up just yet.

But for once, he felt confident that things would end well.",shortscarystories
"Losing a child is never easy, especially during the most wonderful time of the year. It's even worse when you're the one responsible.

It's been hard for me to retain any memories at all lately but for some reason that night I lost him still sticks with me...it's almost as if I'm right there...like I can still stop the car and go back home.

I can feel the blistering cold of December surrounding me since I had sold my heater, but I have prepared as best I could and bundled up my son in all the jackets we own. He looks up at me with his deep blue eyes and gives me a smile that almost melts the snow away, and I second guess this whole idea. ""*Maybe I don't have to bring him inside right now. Maybe I actually will take him to the park like I promised.""* I think to myself as we travel along the icy road.

By the time I've missed the turn to the park, I know damn well I'm not taking him there, and seeing the concern on his face, he knows as well.

""Daddy...?"" he asks me. I don't respond.

""Please don't take me there..."" He begs me. He knows. He must have overheard.

""I'm sorry little guy..."" I can't say his name. Then I'll get too attached.

He's kicking and screaming now, trying to unbuckle himself. But I knew this would happen, that's why I made him wear so many jackets. His arms don't bend enough to allow for much movement.

We arrive. I step out. I pull him out. He tries to dead weight me but it only delays the inevitable. I lay him on his back, and he struggles and cries in a feeble attempt to stand up.

He raises his arms to me hoping I'll pick him up.  His heart shatters when I don't, and I instead do something that will always cause me to question who suffered more tonight.

I knock on the door of the Orphanage and leave.

I'm back home now, in this abandoned house with shattered windows.

I take another hit of dope as my wife throws another plate at me asking me why I gave away our only son. She calls me irresponsible. She's wrong.

I'm responsible for getting rid of my son. Because I'm not responsible enough to give him a good Christmas, or even a good life.",shortscarystories
"Before you judge me, let me explain my reasoning.

When I was 15, I was told I would never be able to have kids. It was hard to deal with since I love kids so much. I even dropped my dream of becoming a veterinarian to be  able to work with kids instead.

But I've been feeling more baby fever lately so I figured, maybe I could get a doll to help cope?

My grandma loves those reborn dolls, collected them for years. I wouldn't of known about them if it weren't for her. I did did a quick Google search of ""reborn baby dolls"" and clicked the first link I saw.

It was called Francesca's Dolls and the reviews seemed pretty good. After a few minutes (okay, more like 30) I finally found the perfect doll. It was made to look like a sleeping newborn girl. I clicked the add to cart button and went off to grab my credit card.

As I punched in my info, my computer screen suddenly shut off. It was strange but I thought nothing of it, even when the screen flashed red.

It took about three weeks for my hundred dollar doll to come in. I came home from work and found the pretty pink package sitting on my doorstep. It wasn't in a regular box with an address on it, just a pink box.

Oh, how naive I was.

I rushed inside and opened it without hesitation and-

It wasn't what I expected at all.

The supposedly sleeping doll wasn't stiff at all, surprisingly. She felt very real. But her eyes.. they were gaping? And her mouth was wide. 

I picked her up like a baby and examined her. 

Her head lolled to the side, her tongue flopping out. I let out a shriek

It had a razorblade going through it. But the worst part hadn't happened yet.

When I dropped her, she crunched. Like a real baby.

I must've made a loud noise though, because my neighbour showed up unexpectedly. He stared at me, then the baby, then me again. Then he doubled over and puked before scrambling for his phone to dial 911.

Well, I hear them getting closer now. I've been hiding because I know they'll never be on my side. I wrote my side of the story here just so someone, anyone, can know I'm innocent.",shortscarystories
"When my daughter was infant we had this makeshift cradle made of rope &amp; cloth folded between them. Whenever we went out locking our house my wife always insisted to unfold the cradle  cloth &amp; tie the ropes. 

 I always was like what difference will it make but she used to be quite adamant on the same &amp; we never left the home with unfolding the cradle. 

I always asked the reason but she never said anything. Finally one night when we were ready to go out I insisted her why she always wanted to unfold she finally turned &amp; stared at me blankly &amp; said ""If we leave the cradle made, in our absence ""It"" sleeps in that"" .  She never said what exactly 'It' was but after that i never left the cradle made. 

 I had tried asking my wife many times what did she actually meant by 'It' but she never clarified. 

My daughter is grown up now but till date whenever I see some lonely cradle I remember my wife's blank stare &amp; what she said  which still gives me small goosebumps.",shortscarystories
"Just trust me. Don’t look. 

It’s not really something you think about. Maybe it’s while brushing your teeth. Maybe fixing your hair. Maybe you want to see how nice you look in that new shirt. But one of those times, something might look wrong. Feel wrong. A hair out of place. A slight change in eye color. But when you get close enough to see what it is, you’re close enough for them to reach you. There won’t be any pain. There won’t be any sound. You won’t even get a chance to scream. You’ll get pulled through, and then that’s it. All you can do now is look through the mirror, all the time, every day, and all you’ll be able to see is the thing that took your place.

Bright white streaks of light shine through the window as I write this report. White.. Shouldn't it be yellow? Life, after the bombs fell, is that way. Nothing you or I can do about that.

So, anyway, today was really exhausting. The herd we met today really created a pain in the neck. We fought them with our bare hands. One of us got bit. That poor guy. Shiny red blood oozing out of his neck, his pale blue eyes changing shades, settling on a dark grey, his bony ankles, warping and tearing through his thin layer of skin. Fifty two times, I've seen the exact same transformation, but I've never gotten used to it.

It is all my fault. I should have been stronger. I keep telling myself, ""this is the last time"". That doesn't change anything. I'm too weak. I'm not made for this.

On the positive side, we found some canned goods at the local supermarket today. After the apocalypse, we're never sure about food. If we're lucky, we find some there.

Oh shit, they're here. If I get time, I'll write some more today.

"""Hey, Dale. Checking out today?"" I asked the thin, sallow man before me.


""No, bud, I need to extend my stay one more night."" I figured as much. Dale had been with us three months, extending by one more night every morning. His company was paying for his room, and my boss was happy to keep on milking their credit card until they finally put a stop to it.


The fact was, Dale was no longer doing any business for his company. No, that had been finished within the first week of his stay. After that, our initial impression was that he had set himself up for a mini vacation on the company dime. I questioned the ethics of it, but the company had approved its card ""indefinitely"", so what did it matter if the yellow skinned, lank haired man drank himself into a stupor and smoked 3 packs a day out on our smoker's bench? He never bothered other guests (except for the occasional complaint about his odor), and his money was still flowing, so let him have his own personal bender.


3 weeks later, it became clear that Dale wasn't partying. He was drinking to die. Suicide by alcohol, that was his goal. Every time I talked to him, he unfolded another piece of a 65 year old puzzle that, when put together, formed the very picture of despair and horror. My boss said it wasn't our business. As long as the card kept feeding our coffers, let the man do what he wanted.


Now it was the three month mark. Dale looked 20 pounds skinnier than the day he'd checked in, and the yellow in his skin had paled to near white. And now, as I put in tomorrow's date, my biggest fear came true: ""card declined"". My skin went cold as I looked back into the watery eyes of the broken creature before me.


""Dale...I'm sorry, it looks like the company cut off your card. I can't extend the stay.""


""...but I don't have any other way to pay! Please, man, I need that room!""


""There's...there's nothing I can do, Dale. My boss said..."" But the words caught in my mouth before I could finish. The face before me had a crack running down the middle. Out of it, a misty darkness floated ominously. The lights in the lobby dimmed. My computer screened flickered.


""I have nowhere else to go,"" came the voice from Dale's throat.


Or rather, voices.


Icy sweat coated my arms. My heart hammered inside my chest. I had to think quickly. ""O...okay Dale. Tell you what. I can give you tonight on the house. How's that?""


Instantly, everything was back to normal. ""Thanks, man,"" Dale said in his own voice, ""Means a lot."" And with that, he headed back upstairs.


When my boss came in that day, I resigned my post. I wouldn't be a part of this anymore. Dale was 3 months into his stay, but he'd checked out after 1.",shortscarystories

Darkness creeping in on all sides
I feel , but most importantly
I feel it

It is near, I have to run,
But the walls closed in
Darkness all over
He’s in here
I’m trapped

I’m hopeless
The darkness encroaches 
I can not see
But I know He is at my bed

The walls close in further
He follows with it
Moving closer and closer
And closest.

As he walked the room became darker
No light
I can’t see
He’s next to me

He reads me
Like a book
He could tell
I’m claustrophobic 

I fell asleep
But not of my fault
It was him
He made me do it

I woke up and moved
But I couldn’t
I was in a capsule 
Just my size

Darkness everywhere
I’m underground
I’m trapped
I waited years but never died
I’m trapped in here

"Waking up in an unknown place is never pleasant. Especially when you can't see anything and your other senses are numb. Especially after being dragged away from a place you once felt comfortable in.

Everything is cold. As if all the warmth was drained from your world. 
Shouts, screams, rapid footsteps can be distinguished and replace the usual gentle voices and dear heartbeats.

And then, silence.
All of a sudden, a voice resonates in the darkness. A prophecy, accompanied by vivid images foretelling death and the afterlife, remiding you just how feeble and insignificant life is.
The memory will soon fade away, never to be remembered until the very last moments.

"For as long as I can remember this painting has hung in our living room.  We are too afraid of what will happen to us should we decide to dispose of it, or what would happen to others if we decided to give it away to an unsuspecting family.  We no longer have guests come over because they have guessed at what we know: misfortune comes to those who look upon this painting.  

My Auntie Sharon came over a few years ago.  We all sat around the fireplace and had some tea, told some jokes and I got to hear of her young life.  After she left, we got a phone call not 7 hours later.  Auntie Sharon, who had seemed so happy and joyful, like her usual self earlier in the day, had done away with little Brandon and then took herself out of the world.  That is just one of the gruesome stories.  The rest, I like to pretend never happened.  This painting is ghastly.  Something must have come over my parents that made them buy it.  It has powers unknown to man and I am guessing that is how this painting selects its victims.  The frame is large, thick and golden, with red edges.  The picture inside is of an ancient bathtub with rounded edges and claw-footed.  This was painted a considerable amount of time before claw-footed bathtubs became the staple of every horror movie.  Past the bathtub, there was a 4 paned window, looking out into a dark forest.  The whole photo was painted in black, gray and white tones.

I know no one but my parents believe me, but I once saw a pair of dark eyes and hands peering at me over the edge of the bathtub.  We cannot live a normal life as we feel a pull to this painting.  I am beginning to consider having this painting removed and somehow passed off to another to deal with this mess one day when my parents are at work.  To do that, I would have to live with the guilt of what I would be passing onto another.  The guilt of passing on evil to an innocent, unsuspecting person.  But why should it be fair that I have to live with this?  Was I not as unsuspecting and subjected to this painting through no choice of my own?  Yes, I think I can live with the guilt.",shortscarystories

You see a shadow out of the corner of your eye, but you could never tell if it’s your imagination or the Mirrors’ distortion. And if you aren’t careful, a reflection might seem more like reality than reality ever has. 

You can’t be sure, but your own reflection looks like it’s smiling at you, even though you’re not smiling at all. You hear laughing. It isn’t from your friends. The floor and ceiling seems to twist and move, only confusing you more as you attempt to leave this once childish place. Sweat is running down your back; it feels like spiders. There’s nothing to be feared here, not really… right? 

Someone (something?) whispers your name. Someone (you realize now that it is definitely something… it definitely isn’t human) that can't be your friends knows your name. Only, there’s no one in the reflections. You can’t tell where to look- it’s just more reflections. There is no direction. 

Everything seems to descend into chaos, and then… you hear footsteps that seem to right you. They are approaching behind you. Upon turning around, you might see what looks like your friends. But something is different. There is something almost inhuman about them… but maybe they were never human to start with.

 Everyone knows the House of Mirrors.",shortscarystories
"I am not that old, or at least I felt not that old this morning.

Until my son called me a Boomer.

It happened this morning, my son was lying on his bed and he said it, those cursed words.

“Ok Boomer.”

I had heard about this “internet meme” but I never expected my own son to call me that.

The so called “Ok Boomer” meme came by on Facebook a few times but I never paid much attention to it, just some bored teenagers with too much time who should be getting a job.

But when my own son called me that, I panicked.

As a single dad I cared a lot about my son, he was my entire life.

But he called a Boomer.

My son wouldn’t just call me a Boomer, I know my son.

He’s a good boy, but somehow he learned those cursed words.

I don’t know how he even learned about the “Ok Boomer”, my son doesn’t talk to other children and he doesn’t surf the web.

My good son never doesn’t even go to school or leave the house.

He’s blind and mostly handicapped and never leaves the basement.

So how’d he learned those words?

I’ll guess I’ll have to torture it out of him tonight.

I won’t allow anyone to corrupt my good son.",shortscarystories
"David banged twice against the glass, knowing the beast could see him. All that looked back though was darkness. He could feel it piercing his eyes. Seeping into his brain and filling it with the nightmare. 
He banged on the glass once more, this time with purpose. A small crack began to appear. He focussed on the darkness. Like a predator hunting it’s prey. A steely determination flowed through him but as always there was no sign of the beast. 
The knowledge that it was out there spurred him on until a sudden pain cut through him and he closed his eyes completely. 
The darkness encumbered him and he felt imprisoned by his own skin. The sound of silence deafened him and he began to feel his earlier optimism had been subjugated. 

He had seen the beast before and had spent the majority of his adult life hiding from it. 
It was now time to confront it. He wanted to see it face to face. Look into its eyes, into its soul. 
David had come to realise that finding the beast was proving to be just as difficult a task as hiding from it once was.

Suddenly the beast banged twice onto the glass. David fell backwards in shock. It was here. He got to his feet as it banged again, this time with more force. 
The crack in the glass expanded. 
David held both his hands up to his head. The pain, like the crack, was growing. He moved his head closer to get a better look. 
Just as he was about to see the beast the crack grew again and the glass shattered.

David fell to his knees, broken. 
He looked down at the bathroom floor. Past his blood covered hands, and down at the smashed mirror, now lying on the ground in pieces. 
He could barely make out a face in one of the shards; it was looking at him, into his eyes, into his soul. 
THE BEAST. 
He looked back at his hands - “What have I done?”",shortscarystories
"Bang.

The door of my home sounds like a gunshot in the air as its slammed shut. We're moving? Where? I want to go back home! Mommy! Daddy! Why are we leaving? Please let's go back-- 

Then I wake up, always at that time. Just a dream, a nightmare. I roll over and try to sleep.

Gurgle. 

My stomach hurts, the sharps pangs of hunger consuming me from within. I can't take it. I dont like our new home. Luckily I awake, barely asleep in the first place. It's not too hard to drift back into slumber at this point.

Thoom. 

The oven closes. I instantly smell something burning. Smoke! Flames! Someone, help! 

And then I wake; another dream. I can practically feel the bags under my eyes, the product of many sleepless nights. I lay back down and let my heavy eyelids return me to slumber. 

-LET ME OUT-

Screams! Pounding, scratching on the walls! Where's my brother? Oh God is he in there? Was he forced in there with everyone else O God -- 

I'm up again. I knuckle my eyes and bury my face in the pillow. I know this will be my last chance to get some sleep. 

BLAM. BLAM.

There are hundreds of gunshots, but I only hear these two. The back of mommy and daddy's heads disappear, and their body's collapse along with the world I knew. But I know this is a dream, right? So I wake up. But then my gaze is drawn down towards the faded numbers on my left arm. And I know no amount of waking up will ever stop the nightmares.",shortscarystories
"&amp;#x200B;

An eastern European chorale group has cancelled all further caroling until its members stop spouting satanic slogans.

The choir of twenty was gathered on a village street, when, in the midst of *O Holy* *Night*, the lead soprano began shouting demonic epithets. 

After her head was secured in a plastic bag and she was dragged away, the choir launched into the jaunty *Jingle Bell Rock.* However, during the second chorus, the entire group surprised onlookers by singing “Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock, s\*\*k my satanic c\*\*k around the clock.”

Other songs followed with more blasphemous lyrics inserted into familiar tunes, including:

\* “Hairy nuts roasted over an open fire…”

\* “I saw mommy \*\*\*\*\*\*\* Santa Claus…”

\* “Rudolph the \*\*\*\*-nosed reindeer…”

Members of the chorale group began crying and screaming over their inability to control their filthy mouths. Finally, as angry listeners pelted them with inch-thick candy canes, frozen snowballs, petrol-filled vodka bottles and flaming chestnuts that had just been roasted on an open fire, they clambered into a horse-drawn cart and fled. 

The choirmaster has cancelled all further public activities until the problem is sorted out. Meanwhile, five of the group’s twenty members, all superb tenors, have been burned alive in the village square.

Needy bachelors were rewarded with the singers’ wives and homes.",shortscarystories
"Yesterday, I’m stuck in a pool. I still remember the way my legs felt every time I used them. I also remember the way I lost them, how I would. The table I’m strapped against is the only reason I can stay fed, let alone feed others. The wide smile of that man before he took my legs would haunt me, which is why I asked him, “Why are you smiling?” If I asked him this, he would’ve gotten angry, so I’ll try not to. It’s almost like he knew I’d survive, even though he knew I shouldn’t, I have thin blood. I’m going to drown if he doesn’t come back, and my kids will starve. I don’t understand why I’m here, how I’m going to get here, or why. All I know is that it’s closing time, I would soon be able to tell from the lights going out. Did nobody see me? Can nobody hear me splashing in the water, frantically writhing around, asking for someone or something to take me home? Sure, I’m getting my wish, something is coming. Of course, I won’t have any hope of escape on my own, this pool has walls around it, which tower above me. I swear I could hear chittering from above, along the edges of the walls. Something hungers for me, and I couldn’t do anything about it, I’m powerless. The metal walls moan, and something in the drain would scream for me. I hear it, but I don’t listen. It knows me. It can taste me. I couldn’t give in, even when a scratch appeared on the wall when I wasn’t looking, one that wasn’t from claws. I’d hear something splash in the pool behind me, but I couldn’t turn to look. A blink is all it takes for me to miss something now, I haven’t seen most of the things that happen around me, I’d only notice what’s different. The scratches, the screams, the moans, they’d come together in some kind of embodiment of an unknown thing. It was wild, thirsting for something that would never sate it’s appetite. I can’t see, let alone open my eyes, simply because I’m afraid of doing so. “YOU THINK YOU’RE INVISIBLE?????” A raspy, high-pitched voice would ask me right into my ear. She wouldn’t break me. I could hear it wading around me in the water. It would touch me, graze me with whatever it had on its body to so with. I’d be confused on the shape of it, what strange appendages protruded from whatever odd form it existed as. I can’t open my eyes to see, I’d break. By then, it feels as if my eyes are sealed shut, my eyelids fused together, the lashes nonexistent, as if I’ll be born with them that way. I’ll almost be able forget they even exist. That’s when I heard it; another agonizing scream comes from the drain, the walls moan. I wish that man took more than just my legs.",shortscarystories
"""The world has changed a lot in the last few hours... FUBAR” he thought as he grabbed the harness, “FUBAR Friday is what they would have called it…” Reflecting back on his fallen brothers.

“Heir Shep!” he called across the room. Shep was a massive German Shepard mix; the best he’s ever trained. People would always claim that there were better breeds for duty, but Shep was trained to do one thing and do it well. What he lacked in breeding heritage he made up for with shear focus and will.

He thought about leaving his pistol at home for today, deciding it was better to have it just in case. Shep would take care of any problems, but he didn’t want to take the chance anyone injuring Shep. Today’s mission was the most important of both their lives. He and Shep moved quietly, cover to cover, avoiding any unwanted attention. “Sporadic Rioting” was the biggest understatement the news may have made about this entire event.

“Beruhigen… Easy boy” he said as they approached the hospital doors. The entire ground floor was in a state of chaos, the limited staff frantically trying to triage the incoming with little resources. Most dogs would have been distracted by the blood and commotion… not Shep, he was on mission.

Having discreetly climbed the stairs to the sixth floor, they made their way to the large steel double doors at the end of the wing. Hunkered in front doors, he took Shep’s harness off… “Achtung…You ready boy???” he whispered. Shep was full at attention, neck hair bristling, the excitement evident in every fiber of his being. He reached up and opened the door… It didn’t’ matter how many times Shep had gone through this, it was magical to watch every time.

“Shep!!!!” The children yelled and ran to meet him. “We weren’t sure if you’d come!” one called out. He and Shep had been doing this same thing for the past 5 years, it helped him to cope with his PTSD. Everyone here knew Shep… The best therapy dog that he’d ever trained. The pediatric cancer ward seemed like the most fitting place for them to be during this time. These children have been staring death in the face for most of their lives, they deserved to be with Shep.

“Open or closed?” he asked the children as he grasped the blind. “Closed!” One called back, “We don’t want Shep to be scared.” He closed the blind, taking one final look at the horizon. The streaks were getting closer from the less significant impacts. He could almost see the comet through the dark cloud cover. They had been right; his city was ground zero for the impact…. “Extinction Level Impact” is what they were calling it.

He moved in with the group of children surrounding Shep and whispered “Braver Hund! You’re a good boy Shep! You'll finally get to meet my brothers.”",shortscarystories
" It's definitely a problem, with something like 20% of people having it, but don't quote me on that.  So chances are, someone reading this knows exactly what I'm talking about.  You'll be sitting there then it sounds like a demon mosquito has made its nest in your ear. A high pitch, shrill noise that makes your brain cringe.  There's little you can do to help, just suffer through it. 

  
  I've dealt with this all my life as far as I can remember, the shrieks coming way too often.  Every time I would grasp my ear in annoyance and pain, my eye watering up.  Recently, I noticed that the shrill sound I was so familiar with was dropping in pitch. I immediately thought it was just genetic hearing loss, but as the past few days slogged on, the tinnitus became more frequent and deeper.  It's almost as if someone put a large bass drum in my ear and beating it hard once everyday.   

  
  Today, I was outside making my way to my car for work.  I was dropped to my knees from the now deep sound, clasping my head in pain.  When I looked up, large silhouettes blotted out the sun and seemed to be advancing; the earth trembling underfoot, all other noise blocked by the tone.

"David sat at the blood drenched table where his CEO once sat at. He almost decided against showing this year, as he knew he wasn’t going to be getting any bonuses with the way her fucked over his boss last quarter. The scrumptious manager from the marketing department invited him as her date so he agreed.

The holiday party started off well enough, some people were taking a while to loosen up while others had pre-gamed before they arrived. It all started on December the 7th, the main event being the boss handing out bonuses to whoever bent over far enough for him that year. 

After the party started getting wild was when the party blasted downhill. First, a man who used to work directly with the CEO, named Charles, showed up uninvited to the party. He had given up working on this company to start a new venture that didn’t work out for him, and we was out for blood.

Charles screamed at the CEO, words that David no longer remembers, and the party stopped dead in its tracks. Charles was escorted out by the CEOs personal security team and the party awkwardly continued on. A few hours later the CEO gave his closing comments. People then gathered their things to head home but the doors would not open. It was then that everyone realized that the hotel staff was nowhere to be seen.

Employees tried to break down the doors, bust windows, and call for help but nothing worked. They weren’t able to physically leave. Once morning came, the employees were dividing into cliques: the violent group who would do anything to get out, the passive group who wanted to wait it out, and David, who had retreated to a corner by himself, smoked his last cigarette.

Eventually, once the next night arrived, the groups had turned on the CEO, blaming him for them being unable to leave the ballroom. After they beat him mercilessly, they stabbed him repeatedly with the leftover steak knives from dinner the night before. Once he was dead, the groups started attacking each other. They fought over the remaining food, drinks, and territory within the ballroom. The finance and accounting firm sticking together as marketing and sales grouped up against the other teams. 

David sat back and watched as the whole company unraveled. By the end of the third day, over half of the employees were dead. Once everyone realized that no one is leaving no matter what, the employees started to relax and the fighting stopped. People kept to themselves as the flesh of the fallen started to fill the ballroom with a stench so foul the employees put up a makeshift wall between them and the dead. 

After the first five days passed, David grew too hungry to just let the bodies rot. He wiped a knife free of the CEOs blood, cut open the cute marketing manager, and took a bite.

"I sit, silent, at the center of the room. Mother had always said to be wary. To be careful not to look Them in the eye. To sit straight, and keep my hands on the table, and to stay quiet. After all, it is Testing Day. I have trained my whole life for this moment.
    So I sit in the middle of the dimly lit room, shivering, but not because of the cold. I see a shapeless man enter the room, silent as a mouse. He is not fat, yet not thin, not handsome but not ugly. He sits down next to me. I close my eyes, trying to resist the urge to recoil. Though the man is nothing to look at, I can feel his power, his confidence. “Open your eyes,” he commands. I do so, and find myself staring into them. His eyes. Filled with an emotion beyond my understanding, not hateful, not friendly, but something in between, as distant and alien as the stars in which they came from. He stares into mine, silent, gauging my worth. He pulls out a device, and looks down, quickly typing something into it. Then, slowly, he tells me, “I have judged your worth. You’re coming back with me back to my planet.” A million forbidden questions pop into my head. I wonder if I was drafted into their army to smite their distant enemies, or if not, what else I will have to do to help them win their upcoming war. As if he knows what I’m thinking, the man says, “You may look at your results. But don’t expect to understand them. They were written in our tongue.” I don’t tell him that I learned Their language by listening to the soldiers that were always stationed near our home. He turns his hand to me, I look at the small device in his palm. I barely make out the words: “Top quality - live enemy target dummy.”",shortscarystories
"“What was that?” Stacy whispered, and pulled free of her boyfriend’s arms. A sharp grumble. A defeated monster slipped back to bed. 

She sat up on his lap and peered out of the window. There was nothing, just darkness. 

“What’s what?” Jeffery murmured, rubbing her shoulder. 

He didn’t really care that she was freaking out. Only that their makeout session had been interrupted. She knew this, but it didn’t bother her. 

She had other things to be bothered by. 

Such as the void waiting beyond his older brother’s convertible. 

And the silence. 

Something had passed by. She had seen it, a shadow that emerged from the depths of the night. No doubt one of his friends playing a trick on them. 

Or maybe, something worse. Something dangerous. 

Jeffrey stopped the massage when Stacy reached for her blouse. 

“Something’s out there.”

He zipped up. He looked at her. 

She looked beautiful, especially when she was scared, and he wished that she’d let him do something. Kiss her. Screw her. Anything. 

But it was hopeless. 

The mood had been ruined. They’d just drive down to her neighborhood, where he would try to avoid the streetlights, those vomit-colored beams of static. She’d leave without saying goodbye. Not even sparing him a passing glance.

And he’d go home with blue balls. 

Not that it was her fault. It was his. 

“I think we should go,” she whispered, eyes now locked on his. “I don’t like it... out… here.” 

Jeffrey looked down at the key. He reached for it, and was about to turn it when he heard something. A shriek. A scratching sound. 

Like the claws of a very large, very clumsy bird. 

Like the grasping fingers of the dead. 

And Stacey screamed, an explosion. He felt her hands gripping him. Nails dig into his flesh, and he tried to push her away. She only clenched her fists tighter than before. 

Something knocked on the roof. Hard. 

And then, the knocking turned to popping. He looked up. Even in the dark, he could see the claws. They were midnight black and curved inward. Piercing the fingertips. 

The charcoal fingertips. 

They wiggled. 

They inched downward. 

Stacey stopped screaming. Began to whimper, like a wounded dog. She crawled backwards, a stray foot striking him. His balls really were blue now. 

She scaled the seats behind them. 

But not Jeffrey. He could only watch as the rest of the thing’s fingers broke through the metal roof, splitting it open. A deep black eye peered inside. It found him almost immediately. 

He held his breath. The fingers were followed by marble-sized knuckles, and those knuckles were then followed by a hand. 

A backwards hand. 

The rip opened wider. The thing pushed its shoulder through. 

Jeffrey heard a car door being slammed shut, and he knew she had escaped and was running away. Outside. 

Outside. 

The last thing he ever saw was the thing’s hand, gnarled with veins and twitching. It was growing bigger. 

And bigger. 

And bigger.",shortscarystories
"I walked in our apartment after a long days work. The first thing I noticed was the rose petals on the floor.

I smiled and followed them to the bathroom door.  Tapped to the door was a typed note.

To my beautiful Rose: I've drawn you a hot bath and put on your favorite music. Relax for as long as you want. I love you - X

I opened the door to find candles, a hot bath, and a radio playing my favorite classical song. My first thought was how romantic this was, my second was wondering where my husband was. That's when I noticed the little closet door open slightly, he was hiding.

I giggled slightly and undressed. The water was the perfect temp. I stayed for an hour before my husband walked in. From the entry door. He looked shocked and confused.

Near my bed. And near the vent. 

And if the man wakes up, then he’ll snake his arm out. It can slip through the grates. It’s thin enough. 

Wiggly enough. 

Your neck is thin enough too. 

He can wrap his fingers around it. Wouldn’t take much strength, not much at all, to break it. Just one squeeze.

well, as you can see. i didn’t listen. yes, i know this may seem as a children’s tale that parents tell when their children misbehaves but hear me out - once you read this, this is no more of a creepy children tale or a scrap up movie plot from tim burton’s amazing twisted mind.

sunday, 2:57 am

i was alone in my dorm and my roommate was out for her friend’s party. she said it wouldn’t take long and knowing how much of a pussy i was she swore. a big ouch, she left at 12 and it’s been three hours. my dorm is pretty small in my opnion, having a big tall closet engraved into the wall and just normal furniture here and there. 

2:59 

my eyes wouldn’t stay off the closet. it’s just giving me a disturbing aura, yes even if it’s a closet, still. my mother’s words just keep cycling around my mind like a script. 

*alarm goes off to indicate that it is 3 am*

i held my breath. my hands gripping tightly on my blanket, ready to throw it onto my head once i see the doors open. 

nothing. 

as you can see, my head was facing the closet which is on the opposite side of the dorm and by that i have to turn my body to its direction. 

i screamed. i felt as if someone was breathing on the back of my neck. i turned around to see my room mate laughing at me. 

“yooo! you should’ve seen the look on your face” she laughed and fell to the ground gasping for air. 

“it’s not funny ughh!” i let out a cry of disgust with a pinch of relief.

"The night began beautifully. 

My lover took me to dinner, we had a few drinks and shared a few laughs. Our song played throughout the establishment-- Can't Take My Eyes Off You by Frankie Valli, of course-- as we basked in each other's company. I had thought about proposing, right then and there. They looked absolutely delightful, and stunning, just as usual. But tonight they were clad in an outfit much more elegant, colored all red and nothing more. It suited them, as well as the environment. I absolutely love them, my dear lover. Things only took a turn when I suddenly blacked out. 

They then helped me out, however. They lent me a hand. I don't remember quite much, but they were of course very kind, and insisted that we go home immediately. I love the way that they watch over me.

As I now lay in the back, comfortably bound and just a bit tipsy from our shared sparkling cider, I notice that the smell isn't quite so pleasant. Of course it won't bother me, I love them so, despite these irrelevant flaws. My other senses are taking in various amounts of pleasurable sensations; the tune of the rain beating against the metal vehicle as my love continues to drive us back home, the faint sound of them playing our song through the radio in the front seat, the warmth and near numbness my body feels as I continuously slip between consciousness and sweet slumber.

Oh what a gorgeous night it was. Nearly breathtaking.

I feel oh so glad that they are the one doing all of this to me and for me. I know it isn't an easy thing to hear when asked, and I know that they still have their doubts. 

They bring the movement of the car to a silent halt, and almost immediately after, my eyes are suddenly exposed to the beam of a flashlight and the sound of their unapologetic sobs. I had always loved that about them, how they would cry when they were sad, without trying to hide and lie. ""I can't do this,"" they tell me, oh so frightened. ""I love you. You know that I do. Why must you have me do this?""

This is something I did not like so much about them; how they always questioned these antics that they know we must follow. But I only grin. They always were the type to worry. ""Sweetheart..."" I coo, ""Would you like me to do this instead?""

They then look at me in shock with their lovely, tear-stained face. They begin to cry even harder, gnawing their bottom lip to silence their whimpers and whines. Even then, trembling and seemingly affrighted, they cut me loose and decide to hand me their pistol. I nod knowingly, understanding what needs to be done in order for us to proceed to the next realm with our Almighty. They understand as well, and kneel before me with their oh so beautiful eyes bolted shut. I will miss their color and the life that they held, but we are needed and must move on from this place.

With only seconds left, they whisper sweet nothings. I am now pressing the pistol to the center of their forehead, prepared and eager to begin anew with our Almighty. ""She will be proud to be with us again."" They tell me. I nod happily, and one last time, they meet my gaze with mutual love. They smile, that oh so sweet smile, creating a picture perfect view to which I pull the trigger. 

The innards of their cranium display perfectly in a pool of vermilion, matching the delicate shade of the outfit that our Almighty had chosen for them on this special night of their rebirth. She will be proud with this result.

And now it is my turn. I only hope that I will be just as appealing to Her as my dearest lover is to me.",shortscarystories
"But *apparently* my new house isn’t just haunted. It’s got temporal issues, too.

It’s not always so bad, but it can be pretty frustrating not knowing if the bananas rotted quickly because the kitchen went through another time loop or if the ghost is just being a dick again.

He spelled out he doesn’t touch bananas when I contacted him last month with a Ouija board. Since then I’ve used a typewriter to communicate with him, but man is he a slow typer.

“Where’d you put my car keys?” I’ll ask, running late for work.

I get the response after taking an Uber home.

    Cookie Jar

Son of a bitch likes to play hide and seek more than my niece, and that’s saying something.

I suppose it could be worse. I think he might even like me; it’s not like he’s actively trying to kill me or get me to move out like the last family. Only real way I could afford a house on my salary.

Still, there are days I feel like I’m going crazy. I’ll drop off a bag of take-out on the kitchen counter and head upstairs to change, only to find an exact copy of my clothes already laid out next to the hamper. I have to visit the bathroom downstairs, then the one near the bedroom, and finally the garage before the room will reset to the present.

To be fair, I sure as hell get my daily steps in.

I haven’t quite figured out the kitchen yet, though. Half the time I find my burrito half-eaten, and there was one time I went to the attic to find it whole when I returned. Something about crossing thresholds affects it, I think.

And at least the poltergeist and I share the same interests in television and games. I’d go nuts if he changed channels on me all the time or ruined my saves. It has made me avoid bringing people over, though.

But perhaps he’d be okay with it. I doubt he’s gotten any action in a long time, and I think he’d be okay with Sarah. She just seems like the type who’s willing to please.

I decided to take her home after our date later, grabbing a banana as I sort through the mail. A third of it was from last week, and I got a package for something I haven’t ordered yet.

It’s as I sigh about a bill for car repairs for next month that the banana doesn’t go down all the way. I struggle to breathe and search for a chair to perform the Heimlich on myself, finding them all moved to other rooms. My vision begins to go dark as I fall to the ground, begging for the ghost to punch the bit out of me.

Instead, I wake up to watch myself eating in the kitchen - the burrito from last Tuesday. And I suddenly understand why I had so much in common with the ghost.",shortscarystories
"There was a man who lived alone. One day he woke up and, to his surprise, found that he couldn't see his reflection in the mirror. After he accepted that he wasn't dreaming, the man started toying with this strange discovery.

He took a photo of himself naked and found nothing more than the wall of his room. He then filmed himself holding a glass of water and found that the glass mysteriously floated in mid-air. At some point, the man began to think that it was just him hallucinating all of this. So he decided to go outside and see if people could see him.

It turned out that everyone instantly stopped doing their activity and just stared at him, baffled, as if seeing a magic trick. The man couldn't help but stand there, as people slowly gathered around him. 

Later on that day, he found that a video just went viral. It was a video of himself running away from the crowd, but all he could see were his clothes, which appeared to be 'mysteriously' flying down the street. 

It was at that moment when he realized he was invisible.

The man locked himself in his room for a while, thinking about what just happened, until eventually, he decided to go outside again, but this time... fully naked.

Just as he thought, no one seemed to acknowledge his presence. So the man began exploring his 'new' world, the world that he could do anything as long as it didn't raise suspicions, the world that gave him a sense of absolute freedom he had never experienced before.

And he quite enjoyed it.

However, when he was back in his room, the man would always feel like there was someone else with him. Every time he lay in his bed, he would have this same feeling. It was as if someone or something slept in the exact same spot as him every night. But what really creeped him out was the rotten smell that he couldn't find where it came from, and it seemed to get more and more intense every day.

Until he couldn't take it anymore, the man put on clothes that covered all his body so people wouldn't suspect and moved out to find a new place to live. He then found a cheap motel room, where he came to the most shocking realization.

There was a news on TV that someone had just reported an intense, obnoxious smell coming from his old room. It was so awful that the police were called to investigate its cause.

The man was frozen in horror as the reporter started describing what was found inside. His eyes were fixed on the monitor. It showed a body wrapped in white being carried out of that room, followed by a blurry image of a rotten body lying on the bed, at the exact same spot he had been sleeping every night.

"Claws of black gold, skull of white silver
Hood from human hide cloaks the soul eater 
His skin begat scales and gnat to rape the earth bare 
His eyes, a deepness that swallowed fear. 
Born of demon union, he killed his mother at birth
The legend of the Reaper is a definition of evil's wrath
He possessed a thorned wraith, 
That sprouted black roses
His soul entwined and in thick, green blood bathed 
Drunk from blood of different races, taken in large doses


Angels on watch, my soul you keep
Save it from the Reaper's bloody reap


The sickle came from an ancient war
A time mingled with hate, pride and kings
Thousands fell by the sword and other gore 
Too much to collect, souls with bitter stings
He needed a sickle to gather the lost 
Piercing right through them, never caring for the cost


Angels on watch, my soul you keep
Save it from the Reaper's bloody reap 


He was the gateway between death and life
And in unholy matrimony, he bacame Satan's wife 
Tortured men in pots of boiling oil
Revelling in their tormented, condemned decay 
Banned from ever walking the earth's soil
He loathed man and his every breathing day
Until one time, a shadow shifted and a body fell
Some words got scrambled and the ban lifted
The Reaper was ushered into man's safe place


Angels on watch, my soul you keep
Save it from the Reaper's bloody reap 


Necks snapped from ropes, dangling suicides 
Teenagers raped little boys to restless oblivion 
Races and people annihilated called it genocide
He giggled at his effect, destroyed the balance; every perfection gone. 
Trembling underneath my bed, I quiver
Listening to the chaos and unspeakable horrors make me shiver.. 
Fingers numb at the beads.. 
They all count on me like a rosary.. 
But I have only one prayer


 Angels on watch, my soul keep 
Save me from the Reaper's bloody reap.",shortscarystories

"It was the night of 22nd September, and the night stood dark and chilly. A cold wind blew down the roads rustling the leaves. Dawn seemed a million miles away.

The house stood at the edge of the corner, dark and grim. It stared ominously into the darkness, waiting for someone. And then, almost as if from nowhere, a hooded figure appeared.

Tall, bearded and scruffy looking. His boots had seen better days, and were worn out and dusty. His jeans, once a brilliant blue were faded and torn, resembling a dusty road. His shirt once white, was almost black with dirt making it a dirty grey.

His face was haunted, and periorbital dark circles under his eyes reflected a lack of sleep and rest. He had once been called ruggedly handsome, but under his unkempt beard and hair, he was utterly unrecognizable.

Slowly pulling of his hood, the man stared at the house. The house stared back. Its empty windows were like eyes looking at the very depths of his soul. The door was a mouth, waiting to swallow him whole. It was tempting – very tempting – to just turn around and walk away, no one would blame him. He may have given everything but this had never been his fight.

But her memory hung around him like an anchor weighing him down. He’d been weak, let her down, and now she was gone. Tears began to sting his eyes and he blinked them away, he could have, no he should have been better.

“I hate this fucking place.”

Saying that aloud – albeit to no one, made him feel a bit better.

The wind seemed to have picked up on his words though. It howled louder and blew more ferociously, almost pushing him to the door.

Sliding his hand into his pocket, he felt the cold, hard steel of the gun under his fingers. Taking a deep breath, he wondered if everything would have been different if he had not been so naïve. It could have all been so different if he had just gone to the movies that night.

Steadying himself, he pulled out a tiny flask.

He took a long deep swig to help settle his nerves.

Clicking the safety of the gun off, he headed towards the door, towards what he hoped was the end.

The door swung open as he got close to it. Welcoming him into the jaws of despair and hopelessness. Gingerly, he stepped beyond the doorway, gritting his teeth and the door slammed shut behind him.

The street was lonely again now.

Empty and abandoned, with the house staring at it menacingly.

Dark and black, there was only the wind for company.

The wind – which had now dropped to a slight breeze and almost seemed to be mourning the loss of a dear friend.

A friend who would not leave the house.

The sacrifice had been made.

The world was safe.

For now, at least.",shortscarystories

Her sunday best, her day of rest, her matted dress. Dirt under her nails, blood on her coattails, I'm off the rails as I've been every day since the summer when I watched them lower her six feet deep into a pit I never thought she'd pull her way out of.

Her eyes are blank, unwired lips ripped to shreds, and she's here to take me back with her. Her ribs peak out from her mortal wound of a chest. Skin and bones and grub, is my baby. Who am I to deny the love of my life a meal she so desperately needs?",shortscarystories
"There was once a town by the sea, yet the town had no warmth

The town was surrounded by vast countryside with rolling hills and grassy meadows

But in the forests lived no game to trade or eat, and the soil grew sickly crops

Yet the town lived and thrived as an organism in a hostile environment, against all odds

On the far edge of town there was a house, and in that house lived a woman

The woman never wed nor birthed any children, yet she lived a happy, simple, quiet life

On the third floor of the house was a chair that sat in front of a window 

The woman sat in the chair every day, waving at all those who passed by

One night the woman left her chair and went downstairs to her bed

In the bed was a man, who had never been in the house before

The man held a knife in his hand and stabbed the woman to death when she got into bed

The man hung the woman up and skinned her like a deer with the knife

The next day the man put on the skin and sat in the same chair looking out the same window as the woman did the previous day and all days before that

The skin on the man looked just like the woman from three floors down

The people passing by waved back as the skin waved",shortscarystories
"Growing up in a Christian household, I always believed that your soul goes to either heaven or hell when you die. Being a decent person and firm in faith, I expected to join the many great souls before me. I did not expect to be reincarnated when I finally checked out. 

A person’s soul is vast and expansive. Dying is very painful. Your consciousness being ripped from the body it has spent so much time acclimating to cannot be compared to any bodily pain ever experienced by anyone! There is only one thing more painful than death: birth. The torture of a newly freed spirit, allowed to expand for the first time in what seems like ages, being crushed and squeezed into a tiny body is inexplicably worse than the physical crushing of Giles Corey. Babies don’t cry because they’re hungry or need a new diaper. They cry because they know even the most painful death pales in comparison to birth. Being reborn is the only downside they see to dying; the ultimate stalemate.

Many religions are based on reincarnation and I’m not sure which is the one true religion. But I promise you, praising the wrong God is not taken lightly. Being born and dying within minutes of each other, only to be reborn a sickly baby who dies in your mother’s arms, instantly seeing the light as yet another cervix opens and feeling the cramming, stuffing pain of childbirth immediately changing to the tearing, shredding pain of death is my current punishment. Will it ever end? Will I ever end? God (whoever it may be) only knows. Hopefully you choose your God more wisely than I did.",shortscarystories

"""It's ok to be scared.""

He turned, she was looking at him eyes burning into his. 

""I know."" 

He glanced around, twilight settling , bats chirping around the orange purple sky, weaving through the darkening trees. A this as he dropped the heavy box he carried, it landing on the piney floor.  

""Not scared though."" 

""Oh, of course. Just reminding you."" 

They met eyes again, a bubble of her lips before a worried pout.

""You don't have to do this."" 

""And what?""

She shrugged, ""Leave the box here and forget about it.""

""No. They'll find it, find me, and more importantly I can't lose you.""

""Sure you could. I would.""

""Sure you could sweetheart."" He smiled slyly looking at her. ""But I can't""

They both looked at the box. Perfectly inconspicuous, a simple brown box, with a small lable on its lid. Grabbing the shovel he got to work digging. 

""What about after?""

""I found you in the woods, half dead. I don't know, we'll make something up.""

""No, about my Dad.""

""With you, we'll have enough to convict him.""

""I'm dead.""

""You're missing."" 

He stopped for a second and looked at her. ""I'll be with you, promise.""

She smiled,""I love you Morgan.""

He laughed, ""Love you too.""

""Obviously"" She laughed back, but stopped as he finished the hole. She watched as he he bent down and cut the tape off the lid, and lifted it. A smell of decay and preservatives leaked out. He ripped the contents into the hole. 

""Ew"" they mumbled in unison.

He put his palm against the blade of his knife and sliced his palm. Blood leaked down his palm as he flicked his blood down into the hole. He started to chant. 

""Wait!"" He stopped and looked at her.

""I'm scared Morg.""

""It's ok to be scared"" he laughed with a mumble, mirroring her words.

With a soft, scared chuckle she closed her eyes. He knelt down, knees touching the dirt mound, and resumed his chanting. Like a forgotten lullaby  he whispered, eyes only on the dirt mound. Minutes passed like eons as night fell high.

A shuffling, scratching noise, and a weird movement of the dirt. He smiled. As a hand poked from the dirt he realised, he wasn't scared anymore.",shortscarystories

I turned around. A guy.


“Your dad’s staying late at work. When I told him I was going for a hike,” he gestured towards his boots and hiking pack, “he told me to pick you guys up.”


I gave a slow nod. Getting picked up by coworkers was pretty common for us.  


“Do you have your phone with you?”


“No, I left it at home.”


The guy shrugged. 


“Well, you can use mine. I’ll call your dad to make sure he knows you’re heading back. But first...” He squatted down until he was eye-level with Isaac. “Hey little buddy, do you like cowboys by any chance?” 


Like most five year olds, his eyes lit up. 


Walking a few paces, he opened the backseat of his car. “Well, while we’re driving home you can borrow my cowboy hat.” 


Smiling, Isaac practically bounced in. 


When he opened the driver’s door, I thought he was going to fish out his phone. But instead, he hopped in and started the engine.

"My father is nailing boards across the window.

He sweats and grunts with each swing. It smells terrible. Like vomit.

My head hurts.

“Almost there, almost there,” says my father. He doesn’t turn around.

I remember someone came in. Someone who wasn’t supposed to. I remember being scared. I remember my father yelling. I remember a flash of light and a bang so loud I wet myself.

But I don’t remember when that happened. I don’t know what’s happened since. 

“Nearly there,” says my father, still hammering. The windows are all covered. The only light is from a little candle on the table. 

“Dad?” I can tell something’s wrong with my father. He’s not the same. The way he’s talking. The way he’s standing, like he’s dizzy or sick or weak like an old man. It’s all wrong. I don’t like it. “Dad?”

The hammer falls from his hand. “Amy?” But he won’t turn around. He won’t look at me.

“What happened? I don’t...I don’t remember.”

He takes a deep breath. Slowly, so slowly, he turns.

There are tears in his eyes. I’ve never seen that look on his face before. It’s the worst thing I’ve ever seen.

“I wasn’t fast enough, baby girl.” He swallows, shaking all over. “I’m so sorry.”

He’s in so much pain it tears me up. I want to go to him, but when I try to stand up my leg goes out. In the candlelight I can see the black wound in my calf. I can see the purple lines - thick and ugly - moving up my leg.

And I can *feel* it, moving through my veins, devouring my cells, making me into something else. A slow, cold poison. A virus. The last virus.

Suddenly, I see the boards for what they are.

“Run!” I shriek. “Get out of here! What are you doing!?”

My father sinks down to the floor. “I promised I’d stay with you.” 

I scream at him. I claw my way to the nearest boarded up window and desperately try to peel back the barricade. 

But the world goes dim and foggy. I can feel myself drifting out of my body. What’s left of me watches silently as my body lurches upright and makes its way toward my father.

He’s crying, and not for himself.

I threw my boots on and headed down C-corridor, still in my sleepwear.

But I’m a good sub. I never said it.

Not when he slapped me, choked me, spanked me and fucked me in the ass. 

I smiled in the shower when I traced the blue and red bruises the restraints had left on my wrists.

People were always asking me – you’re so pretty, why don’t you have a boyfriend? Well, with all the guys I dated, I always felt there was something missing, though I could never put my finger on it.

Until I met Lawrence. When I saw his profile online and that word — dominant — I knew. This was what I needed. I wrote to him and he replied and —

I loved it. Every moment of it. Every slap and humiliation.

It was odd. I was a strong woman, I took no crap from anyone, I had a great career — but nothing turned me on more than to submit to him, to let him control me and hurt me.

He was so hot, with his rimless glasses, curly hair and slim frame. He was kind and patient with me, and the way his muscles bulged when he swung the single-tail —

My God.

He put a slave collar on me and took me to BDSM events, where everyone told me how lucky I was. Alvin — chubby guy, like a teddy bear — told me that Lawrence was a great choice. “There’s no other dom who loves and cares for his subs as much as him.”

Love. He said love.

I’d known Lawrence for only three weeks, but I’d never felt like this, so eager to please, so pliable. As if I were filled by him.

Entirely filled.

I whispered it to him. I love you, Master. And he whispered it back as he cuffed me to the ceiling beam.

“Don’t forget the safeword, darling,” he said when he’d fastened me tight. “I want you to use it if you need it.”

I groaned and closed my eyes, touched by how caring he was. I was so wet.

“Don’t forget,” he repeated as he walked out the room and switched off the light.

I’m a good sub. I didn’t say the safeword.

Not when the light went back on and I saw them surrounding me in their rubber catsuits and grotesque masks.

Not when I saw the woodcarving tools in their hands, or the familiar bloated, jiggling body.

“Why isn’t she saying it?” Alvin squeaked when Lawrence came back into the room. “It’s hot when they say it.”

Lawrence stood before me. The eyes behind the rimless glasses were lucid and amused. “Say it, darling,” he whispered. “It’ll turn us on more if you do.”

No, I’m a good sub. I didn’t say it, not even when he pressed the sharp blade of his knife underneath my eye.

"  There was once, a troubled child. Though young in age, the boy was already plagued with problems of old. 

  He’d been struck with leukaemia. One of the hardest cancers to treat in the world, and he’d been stuck with it almost since he was born. 

  And so as he stared up into the night sky, eyes brimming with hate filled tears, he wondered what anyone else would have. 

  “Why me?”

  The words bounced around in his juvenile mind, as the moon and stars seemed to shimmer and shift, reflected off his tears.

  Only that their shifting was never an illusion. Then the boy heard something else in his head. A voice not of his own. 

  “~Why couldn’t it be someone elseee~”

  The boy should have been scared. Should have been terrified. But the boy also had 4 weeks left to live. His response did not need to be heard to be understood. 

   That night, the boy slept more peacefully than he ever had in his life. He had felt something change inside of him, dreamed of a life of longevity ahead. For the first time in his life, he didn’t have to fear a death in sleep.

  And in the morning, for the first time in his life, he wished he’d never woken up. Because the voice had kept its promise. 

“~Why couldn’t it be someone elseee~”

  Only it wasn’t someone else. It was everyone else. The whole world had felt the change. Felt their guts drop to the floor. Felt their eyes go a little dim. Felt their blood turning against them. Lucky for them, they only lasted 4 weeks.

  The boy was not so lucky. The boy watched as the world died with that look in their eyes. The eyes of blame. The eyes of the sick cursing the healthy. He would come to miss those looks. Those looks of hatred his family gave him, because at least there was something that looked at him. 

  After 130 years, the world was a thorough garden. The only thing that wasn’t a plant, the boy that had lost the life in his eyes, yet didn’t lose enough to die. Although he thought he saw the moon and stars shimmer once more.

"I draw humans, sometimes just with a pencil but sometimes with expensive high quality paint.

I can draw other things but my specialty is drawing humans in the end.

I don’t know why, but there’s something about drawing something that’s supposed to be moving and capturing it in one single frame.

How much emotion a human can put in a painting is endless, almost unnatural.

It's almost poetic, a human drawing a human.

It’s fragile, if they have the wrong pose it can break the illusion.

Can’t make the arms to long or it will look creepy.

If you draw their faces wrong it will be painful to look at.

But I became better at posing them and I think I perfected this art.

I learned to draw with a pencil, a brush and even learned how to make deeper lines with a scalpel.

Though I wished I could, I can not spend all my time drawing.

Sometimes I have to look at actual humans instead of the ones I paint, study their behaviour and try to find the best way to put them on paper.

Sometimes I have the feeling that I can draw humans all day and never get enough.

But sadly I can't.

You know that problem right?

I don’t get much of a chance to inspect it as the only door opens. A man wearing a white suit and well-kempt facial hair smiles politely at me despite being flanked by a pair of guards. They’re all rather tall and sport a pair of wings, and the halos on their heads start a rush of memories flowing through my mind.

The suited man helps me up after I’ve fallen over, recoiling from the vision of the truck that must have sent me here. “Is this,” I begin to ask him.

“Yes,” he replies. “Please be patient, I’ll be happy to explain in a moment. For now, will you follow me?”

I nod. Fully upright I find myself as tall as the rest of them. I feel stronger now, too, and my beer belly is completely gone. Considerably confused, I wait until I’m seated in an interrogation room of sorts.

The man takes a seat opposite me. “Welcome to Heaven,” he starts. “No, I am not God. Free will was part of the original plan, angels and demons are real, and we don’t actually care all that much about masturbation or the gays.”

I blink, supposing he’s used to answering some of the more common first questions. “Was I a good person?”

At that, he smiles. “Wouldn’t be here if you weren’t.”

“And Tracy, and the kids? Are they going to be alright?”

He tilts his head a bit. “They’ll mourn you, of course, but we believe they’re fully capable of having bright futures.”

Thank God. Or, rather, is that weird to think now?

“So what now?” I ask. I have plenty of other questions but I’m more curious about what my afterlife will be like. Do I have to wait all the years for my family to pass on their own? Will Tracy meet someone else and not want to be with me when she dies?

“Glad you asked,” the man - the angel - says. “Normally you’d be put into dream housing, a home designed for maximum comfort.”

I slant my eyes. “Normally.”

He grimaces. “Unfortunately, Hell has decided to attack and… This isn’t easy to say, Eric. But you’ve been drafted.”

I chuckle. He can’t be serious. Me? In a war against demons? The angel stares at me, straight-faced.

“You’re not kidding,” I confirm.

“It’s a lot to process, I understand. I used to be like you, believe it or not.”

I don’t. And then, I think a little further. “You said free will was a part of the *original* plan.”

"With an effort, he sat up in his hospital bed to look out the window. His time was drawing near, he knew that much. Being a religious man, the end did not cause him fear, for he believed in an afterlife. He lived a good life. He'd be seeing his dear Beatrice soon enough. 

Watching the sun set, he could only feel content. He watched it turn orange, then red, as it sank below the horizon, his gaze shifting away only as a fit of coughing caused him to slump back into his pillow. His breath came in sharp rasps, each one a labor to his body. 

He didn't remember falling asleep. 

He woke up once with a sharp pain in his chest, then fell back onto his pillow, too weak to do anything but stare at the wall. He was unable to buzz for a nurse, but he heard footsteps coming his way.

When the doctor walked in, he found he couldn't turn his head. Or speak. He was aware of a monotonous buzzing. The doctor sighed, a sad look in his eye, and moved away from his field of vision. The buzzing stopped. Why was he unable to get the doctors attention?? Couldnt they see he needed help? 

The doctor approached him and shone a bright light into his eye. Finally, they'll do something about this... 

To his dismay, the doctor reached his fingers straight towards his open eyes, pulling the lids down over them. Darkness covered him in a silky blanket.

""This is outrageous,"" he wanted to say, but was unable to. 

It felt like hours went by before he heard a familiar voice. ""Dad!"" Hope kindled in him; his daughter would surely make things right. ""He was a good man, a kind man,"" he heard her sob. He felt her hand touch his. ""Heaven is celebrating the arrival of a pure soul..."" 

He wanted to scream. To stop his daughter's unnecessary anguish. To berate the hospital staff for their ineptitude. He was right here, listening to them ramble and ignore him, dammit! 

His insufferable rage reached a crescendo as he felt a sheet cover his body, felt himself being wheeled out of the room, heard some staff joking over the aroma of their meal, heard his daughter talking about arrangements...

Then realization crashed over him in a cold wave. He was dead. But there was nothing after. No afterlife which religion preached, absolutely nothing except an endless cognizant monotony for his soul, a fate he now knew awaited everyone upon death. He imagined the stuffiness of the coffin, the smell of detritus, the feel of worms burrowing through his eyes and slithering amongst his decaying flesh. No, there was absolutely no heaven - that was a lie - but he might just be in hell.",shortscarystories
"They said there was no cure.

The disease spread through the world like wildfire. Every single living lifeform on the planet had contracted it within days. 

The longer you had it, the worse it got. Day 1, coughing. Day 2, sneezing. Day 3, vomiting. Day 4, bleeding. Day 5, balding and hacking and crying and suffering and hurting and dying. Dying. So many people died.

They said there was no cure.

Everyone tried to find it. They tried. They really, really did. But nobody was ever able to find it. They wasted all of their money on something that they eventually decided did not exist. And so they were left to watch as everyone on the planet died before them.

They said there was no cure.

There was chaos. Anarchy. Murder. Everyone tried to take out their anger on everything around them as if destroying everything before the disease could would miraculously make them the winner. It did not make them the winner. Everyone died. Everyone.

Even my wife.

Even my children.

But not me.

As I wandered the empty streets, the silence practically deafening, I began to wish that the disease had killed *everyone* after all.

They said there was no cure.

But there was one.

"I saw her for the first time 3 days ago. Since then, I have not stopped following her. I did not realize 10 years ago when I thought I could not care for a child what my reaction would be if I ever saw her again. Now I know. It is regret. She is 10 and beautiful. I do not need a DNA test to tell me she is mine. Inside I can feel it. She was the one I carried in my womb. And I want her back. I have been thinking of a way to get her back but I know it will not be easy. I cannot kill the husband and wife looking after her, the ones she calls her parents, because that would draw too much attention. My best bet would be to watch and wait until they take another trip to the mall. I will have to make my move then, and be quick about it. I will have to keep her indoors with me for at least 2 years while the city will be looking for her. Then I can start by dying her hair and doing what I can to change her appearance. I can take her out slowly at night and then for short periods during the daytime.

Whatever has to be done I will do. It is my own fault; if I had not given her up all those years ago, I would not have to teach her how to love me.",shortscarystories
"I slammed the door shut, as my father and I had had another row. I'm currently 16 and my mother died 10 years ago, she was a wonderful person, the person who gave me birth and protected me as nobody did. My father said she got what she deserved and I've never understood why he was such a disgraceful person, so I couldn't feel something for him but hate. After I had slammed the door shut, my father shouted from his bedroom ""YOU ARE NOT A KID ANYMORE, TOM, YOU'RE THE FUCKING SHAME OF MY LIFE!"", then I entered my bedroom, locked the door and plugged my earphones on and went to my safe place with Metalica. It was almost midnight, so I lied on my bed listening to my favorite band and slept.

I woke up and went downstairs to the kitchen, my father was making a sandwich and looked quite worried, then he looked directly at me and said ""Son, I love you very much, but there is something you got to kno-"" before he could finish his speaking he had his head shot. I screamed as his lifeless body was falling down to the floor. I looked at the window and there was a cloaked man outside, the man was using a deer skull mask. Then I realized somehow it was already night, although I've just woken up. He could've shot me, but it seemed he didn't mean to harm me.I ran around all the house and locked all the doors and windows, the man tried jumping through the window which he killed my father, but I shove him back and locked the window, I grabbed the pistol he dropped. I realized there were more of that man, they were carrying pistols and knives with them.

I ran to the basement and locked the door, where I'm writing this thing right now, don't want it to be called a diary or anything else, when we name something, it loses its whole meaning and turns into a meaningless word. They're in and looking for me right now, I hear their footsteps, I know I won't survive with this pistol, they turned off the power and I can't call for help. I've heard a voice saying ""Finally, after all those years, we're getting Tom's sacrifice done, he can't hide forever, faster! "", it was a familiar voice. Now, I can understand that my mother's sickness was my father's invention in order to protect me and I regret not being able to love him back.",shortscarystories
" It read forty Fahrenheit that day. We were forbidden to go out when it was above thirty-two, but weeks of eating canned beans had done terrible things to our stomachs. Besides, it just snowed the day before, so we were confident no Fungus animals could have made their way up here yet. 

After morning prayer, we sneaked out of Camp to hunt in the forest. There’s me, who carried a hunting shotgun, Tom, who carried navigation equipment, and Danny, Tom’s older brother, who carried gasoline. Just like Tom and Danny, I was rescued into Camp after my family died from Fungus. We developed a liking for each other the moment we met, being the only teenage boys within Camp. Tom and Danny taught me that when killing someone with Fungus, I must aim for the head.

We were about two miles outside camp. Pine trees and boulders interspersed. On the snow, Tom noticed footprints. “Rabbit,” he whispered. Trying to be quiet, the three of us followed the footprints into a rocky terrain. We were so engrossed in the footprints, we didn’t notice the mountain lion crouching behind us. 

The lion pounced Danny and gnawed down on his neck. Tom tried to punch it in the face, but its claws grazed his forearm. I took aim and shot the lion straight through the skull but it was too late. Danny had bled out and died. 

Seeing the exposed skull of the lion, my worst fear was confirmed: Fungus had invaded its brain. Once an animal got infected, Fungus found the way to the brain and drove it crazy. The dead were not safe either, for Fungus somehow revived them. The only way to dispose dead bodies was to burn them. That’s why we carried gasoline. 

That evening, Camp leaders discussed how can a Fungus animal appear during winter. Some said the animal hid in a cave, others feared Fungus had mutated. Either way, they decided that Camp was not safe anymore. If we wanted to survive when summer came, we had to relocate five hundred miles further North, where the weather is permanently below freezing. I spent the next hour with Tom. He was strapped to the bed with leather belts. White liquid oozed out of his eyes. His mouth repeatedly made chomping motions, as if his only desire left is to bite.

In the morning, Tom’s bed was empty. Doctor couldn’t save him. We got order to leave Camp after breakfast. Even though it was seven in the morning, a heavy snowstorm made everything dark. The leaders said the snowstorm was advantageous because Fungus animals couldn’t attack us in this weather. We all set out on foot; snow piled deep to our knees. During morning prayer, I prayed that Fungus hadn’t adapted to the cold yet.",shortscarystories
"I would know after all, since I've been watching them for the last few weeks. It isn't *every* night they act weird, but often enough that I've started a vigil from my window. 

They moved in about a month ago, but only the woman ever showed herself to us. But I know better; her husband (or boyfriend or lover or something) visits her in the middle of the night, way past curfew. When all the street lights come on and the house's lights turn off, he'll appear from somewhere hidden. It used to be from the woods not too far from the cul-de-sac, but now he comes from the streambed behind their house.

Like I said, it isn't every night. Maybe three times a week. But it's what he **does** that's *really* suspicious. 

He breaks into their own house! And then uses the front door to leave quickly.

Talk about weird, right? The man shows up, carrying things I can't really see, breaks into the house (using a window I bet), stays for a few hours, then just right out the front door he goes.

At first I thought she was getting robbed over and over! But there was never any fighting or sounds coming from the house - so it had to be something consensual. Plus I never actually saw him leaving with anything. 

This last night though, something big happened. There was a loud sound! Like a *gunshot*. And wouldn't you believe it the man came crashing through the door right after. He really dashed out of the house. I couldn't believe it; He went right into the nearby bushes, got on a bike and rode off! Who knew he had a bike *there*? 

Then the police showed up. She came out of the house with them in a blanket. They tried talking to her, but she just kept shrugging at them. She kept her distance too, even though they led her out. She must've felt guilty they were up to all of this weirdness and told her husband off, but knew she was in trouble for the gun.

Can you believe some people?",shortscarystories
"I had always wanted a cockatoo. I loved watching videos online of people teaching cockatoos to talk. I knew that they didn’t actually have much of a grasp of the language, but it was still so fascinating to me. I finally caved and decided to purchase a beautiful solid white one, named Belle. I love her. She is the sweetest bird, and teaching her to talk was so easy. It’s hard to remember sometimes that she is just repeating back learned phrases, not having a conversation with me. 

I want her to be able to pair words with feelings, such as “I’m hungry,” or “I want to play.” I want my beautiful bird to be happy in my home. It is just the two of us; I don’t have any close family or friends around often. She is the smartest bird and I love her so much. 

Tonight she was flying freely about the house, and she landed on the back of the couch, watching out the front window. “Scary outside,” she said. That’s odd, I thought. ‘Scary’ isn’t a word I have taught her. I felt a little uneasy, but I peeked out the window. I saw nothing, just an empty yard. 

“Belle, come,” I said as I held out my arm for her to hop on. I locked the front door and went into the kitchen to make dinner. She stayed in the kitchen with me, trying to steal bits of food as I cooked. I forgot about earlier already, sitting down and enjoying my meal.

Suddenly, Belle flew out of the kitchen and down the hall at full speed. I heard her rustling around a bit, then suddenly she screamed. “Scary, scary inside!”

She hasn’t spoken in a few moments, but I hear some footsteps now. I don’t think she’s heavy enough to sound like that.",shortscarystories
"When you read this you would probably be thinking I'm just overreacting and I probably am but... I just can't get the image out of my head

After a long day of school I sat down on the bus waiting for my friend, Bill, bill was a nice guy who had a sort of dark sense of humour. More gallos humour though and never was liked by the people on the bus and some people in his year group. I knew from various minor details that he doesn't have a good home life but tried to keep happy. 

A couple days ago he told me something chilling
The conversation went something like this

""Heya bill""

""Hi Frank"" 

""Have you seen what unas annus is?""

""Yea it's the thing about it being killed in 1 year""

""Not neces-"" he cut me off mid sentance 

""Speaking of death I'm gonna defiantly kill myself by the end of the year""

I was shocked. I... I didn't know what to say at all, it was just so out of left field.

""Dude... dont, it's not worth it. Trust me, it's better to prolong the period of time you have here because it will happen anyway. So dont""

""Why does it matter? As you said we are gonna die anyway.""

""No that's not what i meant by it will happen anyway. As in there are people here who will care if you die"" 

There was no more conversation afer that but he didn't seem convinced. 

I know that he has a lot of stuff he could use but I honestly think if he does kill himself he will take alot down with him

I might just be overreacting..

"A fisherman found the left hand off the coast of Maine. The palm was pale and bloated, and fish had nibbled most fingers down to the bone. Part of his fingertip remained and a partial print identified him. It was the hand of our daughter’s killer. My wife burst into tears as the detective explained he was likely dead. I was more than skeptical, however. They’d lied when they told us they’d catch him. Still, some relief washed over me knowing the scum might never take another child.

They found his right hand a week later, mangled and broken. It had washed up on a New Jersey shore one afternoon. The officers told us it seemed more than certain he’d tried to flee the country on a boat that had capsized. “Karma,” they said as if a boat accident is a fair price to pay for what he did to our little girl. 

Weeks passed and other parts trickled in across the coast. A pair of feet, ears and even a nose. They found the calf and thigh muscles sawed down into shank steaks afloat in the Chesapeake Bay. It was then obvious his death hadn’t been accidental. They told us he must have been butchered alive, and I had to admit, that gave me some comfort. Whoever killed the animal made him suffer.

We received a few calls with more information about the parts they dragged up in nets from the ocean. His forearms, elbows and lower jaw. I began to relish these bits of information that would trickle in. I finally got some bounce back in my step and was almost content enough to even bring up the idea of having another child to my wife. Then one night the power went out. As I descended the stairs into the dark basement to find the fuse box, I heard a muffled rustling coming from the back wall. 

I found a hidden seam in the cement all; a secret door I’d never known about. I opened the heavy panel to reveal a foul-smelling chamber no larger than a small bathroom. I froze when I saw a silhouetted form in the shadows. Its contours were jagged and bizarre. My heart jumped in my chest when it twitched. My eyes adjusted to the darkness and I could then see the hideous details.

A gargled whimper trembled the tongue, which dangled from a jaw-less mouth. Lidless eyes pleaded, wide with terror. Gnarled stumps of arms raised up in defense. I left quickly, sealing the horror back inside of the wall. I switched on the circuit breaker and raced back up the stairs. I slid into bed and sidled up to my wife, and as I wondered which piece of the puzzle she'd leave next, I hugged her close and smiled.",shortscarystories
"Jessica wanted to break up with Tim.

It was true love at first. It then became boredom, and boredom slowly transformed into hatred, like a benign tumor turning into cancer and eventually killed their relationship

She hates he always sniffs her hair while holding her in his arms. She hates the sound his key chains make when he walks. She hates the angle of his smile. She hates the way he talks. She hates the way he fucks. She hates everything about him.

When she told Tim she wanted a break-up, his tears poured down his face as if her words were missiles destroying the dams that were his eyes. That wasn’t the case. She was actually going for the heart, where it really hurt. She knew the only way to get out of this relationship was to break him.

And she did.

She had thought of him from time to time after the break-up - not that she wanted to get back together, but she just needed someone sometimes and Tim was always the guy - especially that night when she woke up freezing.

The chilling wind that caused the coldness blew into her flat with a high-pitched howl through an open window. Her heart sank. She always made sure she locked that window because people could easily got in via fire escape. The realization that this might be a break-in froze Jessica. Every corner in the dark she couldn’t see felt like there might be something lurking . She reached her hand out trying to grab Tim’s instinctively but there was no one there and this made her heart sank even deeper. What she didn't know was that if she had reached out any further, she might have *felt something*.

After a few minutes, when she was almost certain nothing was in her room, a little sound of metal colliding, almost like wind chimes, broke the silence. Jessica immediately dived under the sheet, trembling, almost drown in her own fear. She couldn’t told if the bed was actually moving or was she shaking too rapidly. She entered 911 on her phone but didn’t dial it, afraid she was just making things up out of fear.

Time passed and nothing happened. Jessica had convinced herself she was just being paranoid and started to doze off. When she finally fell asleep, she thought to herself maybe she was just scaring herself. Maybe Tim’s absence was really impacting her life. Maybe she needed to apologize to him. Maybe, maybe, maybe…

Maybe if she hadn’t fallen asleep, she would've felt Tim slithered out from underneath her bed.

Maybe if she hadn’t fallen asleep, she would've heard the sound Tim’s key chains made, like wind chimes, when he walked toward her with tears in his eyes and a knife in his hands.

Maybe if she hadn’t fallen asleep, she would've felt the knife tear through her heart.

Maybe if she hadn’t fallen asleep, she would've still been alive.",shortscarystories
"I sucked in my breath as the door flew open, and the creature began to slink into my bedroom. The thumping noises it made as it crawled towards me were deafening, but not nearly as bad as the muted thuds against carpeting that signified it was getting closer.

I held my breath and shut my eyes as it perched itself on my bedframe and leaned towards me. I hoped it would at least make things quick.

No such luck. It pounced onto my chest and within seconds began digging its sharp claws into my abdomen, ripping into my guts and shoving them into its mouth by the handful. I started to scream on instinct, but turned and swung it's clawed fist at my jaw- blowing the whole thing off from my head before I could make any type of noise.

I sunk back in bed as it continued to tear me apart. Even as I sunk into unconsciousness the pain I felt was excruciating. As my vision blurred, I felt comfort in knowing it was almost over.

Then suddenly, at seemingly the snap of a finger the pain had vanished. I rose up in bed to see that my stomach and jaw were both once again in tact, though my jowls still felt a bit sore. As I took a moment to massage them, I heard a cough above me, and looked up to see the monster sitting at the end of the bed.

""Your meat."" It growled in its deep voice as it pointed a finger at my stomach, ""It's getting too fatty. Stay in shape, or else I'll find somebody else to eat from."" It snarled at me one last time, and cackled when I jumped up, before it crawled back onto the floor and scurried off, closing the door behind it.

Lying back in bed and staring at the ceiling, I contemplated my situation. It was difficult, being the monster's personal meal every night, the pain was unbearable and its process of revitalizing me afterward was always uncomfortable. On top of that, it never seemed completely satisfied afterward, and in a weird way it sort of hurt my feelings.

In the end though, I shut my eyes and tried to fall back asleep. At least, I thought to myself with a sigh, as long as it has me nobody else will have to deal with it.",shortscarystories

"They arrived instantly, surgically placing themselves around Earth. If the world’s scientists and governments were ever aware of the impending invasion, they kept it to themselves. The very air seemed to suddenly grow heavy, and the skies darkened as ships flanked our planet. Their ships, six of them, were twice the size of the United States, shadowing entire continents; ushering in an oppressive darkness heretofore unknown by mankind. *Night* came suddenly, evilly, as if the Sun had been extinguished. 

They made no demands—offered no attempts at communication.  Their appearance was impossibly swift, as if by some faster-than-light means they had transported themselves into the space around our planet; presumably aware of us long before we were of them.  

When darkness fell on Earth, and when the undeniable reality of our imminent annihilation set in, the atrocities you’d expect to happen, happened. Looting, rape, murder, that collective indulgence of violence and depravity which before had barely been kept in check under the restraints known as “civilization” and “law”.  

What you might not have predicted is that such activities lasted for an hour, maybe ninety minutes. A fast and widespread realization came to both the civilian and military populations, that such things were useless, outright absurd, if one simply looked up and saw the country-spanning vessels of death hovering miles above our atmosphere.  

So, the crime and madness all stopped. Mankind, perhaps for the first time in its existence, resigned itself to doom at the hands of a seemingly insurmountable adversary. The aliens had yet to rain extraterrestrial death, but neither had they extended a tentacle or probe in peace, so without much else to do in its assuredly last moments, mankind did what it does best. It put on a show.  

Across the planet, in both rich and poor neighbors, small towns and bursting cities alike, concerts, parades, and sports events were held. People gathered, performed, watched others perform, and had one last “hurrah!” at the threshold of oblivion.  

The aliens, who had been priming their weapons for the eradication of Earthen life, had their interests piqued by the human’s strange, delusional display of mirth in the face of their destruction. Alien captains belayed their commands to fire, and using their spying instruments, observed the surface, where they saw billions playing and celebrating together.  

The aliens, beings whose civilization was derived from origins of absolute pragmatism and technological advancements at all costs, had forgotten—if they’d ever known—such displays of recreation. Closer they watched, and their amazement steadily grew, until the ship’s leaders led delegations to the surface, so that they could more closely study the never-before-seen behavior. 

Mankind, whose technology was of a comparatively primitive order, but still engineered with considerable powers of destruction, seized the opportunity, and simultaneously detonated Earth’s store of nuclear armaments; killing the alien delegation and themselves. In response, the ships above commenced orbital bombardment of the Earth; certainly not out of necessity, but spite—for they knew in a way they’d been beaten. ",shortscarystories

"Our eyes met.

Out of all the days in my life, it had to be today when our eyes finally met. I swear if it was some other day i could have been bragging about it. But today was different.

The morning was breezy, sunny and pleasant. Exactly how I don't like it to be. For the past few days it had been comfortingly cloudy which made it gloomy and cold. I liked it that way. But today it was all about birds chirping, children squeaking and flowers blooming. Like a fairy tale. 

And in this fairytale-like day I saw him. I see him almost everyday actually. I see him when I walk across the street, when i am coming back from grocery- always near my locality. I am guessing he stays somewhere near. And he kind of looks handsome. More like cute. 

But there is only one problem. He doesn't know I exist. Sigh! He just doesn't look at me. He doesn't know that I have been looking at him, searching for him, to be honest. Everytime I walk around I pray that I can get a glimpse of him.

But today as I was returning from my class, I saw him. It's a lucky day today. 
But something else happened. He turned his head and our eyes met. He looked at me and smiled. 

And smiled. 

Like he has always known me or something. I couldn't be more happy. That godly smile was directed at me. My heart skipped a beat.

If I wasn't entranced by his smile, I would have noticed my heart had skipped a beat. Two beats. Three. I had skipped all the beats it was supposed to be beating. 

If I wasn't entranced by his smile, I would have noticed the speeding car that did not stop at the signal.

If I wasn't entranced by his smile, I would have noticed the people panicking at what unfolded in front of their eyes.

If only I wasn't entranced by his smile, I would have noticed my  body lying on the street , bloodied and lifeless. 

If I wasn't entranced by his smile, I would have noticed he was not an ordinary person.

And only if I wasn't entranced by his smile, Maybe i couldn't have been this lucky  to meet him afterall.",shortscarystories
"Recently, I got a message from a friend that my story was bad. He told me that my story was unbelievable and not scary at all. However, the next day, he changed his mind and said my story was great. This situation was becoming frequent and I saw the pattern. Somebody criticised my story and the next day, they changed their mind and told my story was flawless.

So, I decided to check out my theory by criticised my own story about a monster crawling under your bed and lay eggs inside the sleeping person.

That night, I went to sleep and at around 2 mornings, my phone rang. I picked up and heard:

""Change your opinion about your story or I'm going to come.""

The phone cut out before I got to ask anything. Then, the light suddenly opens on its own and my bedroom door opens itself.

A slug with spider legs fell down from the ceiling. Its crawled from the door to my bed and I tried to run but the slug jumped out and grabbed on my head.

The slug let out a little mouth out of its back and screeched on my face. I decided that was enough and changed my opinion about my story.

The slug jumped off my head and turned into dust after landed on the floor. My phone rang again and I picked up:

""Good, don't criticise your story again.""

I can't sleep after what happen and stay up till dawn.

This makes me think about what happened to everyone who criticised my story. Those who criticised my story about a doppelganger that's ripped off their private parts, a ghost that jumpscare every time they blinked or a clown shapeshifting into a child and slaughter the whole family.

"…and that’s when I saw a bright light,” Mr. Fresco said with the excitement of a man reborn.


That’s when I stopped listening. I knew what would come next. 


*Feelings of intense joy*.


*Seeing departed friends*.


*God says it’s too soon.*


The usual.


I’ve been listening to near-death experiences and the afterlife stories for decades. They never differ from Mr. Fresco’s account. Soon enough, you let the recorder do the listening and upload to the records later.


Occasionally, I get someone who says they went to Hell. These used to be exciting. Stories about hellfire and brimstone. Drowning in pools of excrement. Black gelatinous voids. Endless torture. The gnashing of teeth. Demons.


Even those stories lose their appeal. The commonalities between them are as bland as sauce-less pasta.


“We floated toward the light,” Mr. Fresco continued. “Then all of a sudden, I felt like I got hit by a tidal wave.”


“We?” I asked catching the last bit of his sentence. 


“Yeah, me and all the other dead people,” Mr. Fresco answered. 


“I see.”


This was the first I ever heard of a shared experience. 


At this point, most people are expelled back into their bodies. God or something else tells them, *It’s not your time yet.* Or if they’ve gone to Hell, *You’ll be back soon!*


“Next thing I know, me and all the others are thrown backwards head over heels. I spun out of control, almost hit a couple of others, and the light went out. Each time I’ve gone back, the light isn’t there anymore,” Mr. Fresco answered shaking his head. “I don’t want to go back!”


After finishing the interview, I wished Mr. Fresco a quick recovery from his third heart attack, bid him farewell, and headed to my next appointment. 


“Coincidently,” it was in the pediatric ward of the same hospital. On the elevator ride down, I checked my phone and there were several missed calls from the office.


“What’s going on?” I asked my secretary, Tanya.


“Something’s wrong,” she replied.


“What?”


“Our phonelines are ringing off the hook. Our email is blowing up too.”


“That *is* weird.”


“You pranking me? Did we start advertising?”


“No on both accounts. I don’t know.”


“Then what the hell is going on?”


“I’ll call you back,” I replied then hung up.


A moment later, I walked into the room of twelve-year-old, Elroy Mallory, a child with terminal brain cancer who’d returned after being declared dead on four separate occasions. 


“The first time, there was this white light. It didn’t hurt my eyes. It was just warmth and joy. It wanted me and all the others to come to it. Then it felt like something invisible hit me and everyone was thrown back. The next time I went back, the light wasn’t there anymore.”


“What’s there now?”


“Cold and darkness,” Elroy replied with fear and confusion on his withered face. 


After finishing with Elroy, I called Tanya back.


“We’re still blowing up here!”


“I think I know what’s happening…”",shortscarystories
"         Trembling…I was jarred awake by my own trembling. Now I lay here and realize my ill fate. I am growing shorter of breath with every passing second. As my eyes adjust to the absolute darkness I am able to see the surroundings that shall be my final resting place. I feel around frantically, trying, hoping for a flaw in the wood. The trepidation is surrounding me tighter than the shroud I find myself in. As I search for some frailty in the box, my worry turns to ferocity at the events that led to my ultimate demise. I scream, letting my rage flow through my teeth, with such a violence I thought I might burst through this thin coffin and back into the world. Although all is for not, for I have been doomed to spend my last moments with no hope and no ear to hear my cries. Now I am down to my last breaths, and even in this eternal black, it seems a darker form is enclosing me. The last of my thoughts of this world send a final chill down my spine, as I witness the fire that awaits me beyond.",shortscarystories
"I am sure all of you have heard of the mysterious black eyes kids. Little kids that turn up randomly knocking on your front door and asking if they could come in, the one thing that is noticeable is their black eyes. People have spoken of their dread when the black eyed kids show up at their door. 

I am a taxi driver and for the last month I kept on getting calls for taxi rides. When I drive up to the person who ordered a taxi, to my detriment it has always been a black eyed child smiling and holding some cash. 

""We need to get into your car please let us in"" they would always tell me

I would always drive off and I haven't made any money last month because i keep turning down rides because every caller I have had last month, is a black eyed child. They know I need money and as my profession as a taxi driver sooner or later, I would have to let them in.",shortscarystories
"I don’t understand why my mommy and daddy would say that I'm not surpossed to talk to strangers. They said that they're dangerous and wanna harm me. That didn't happen with Fred.

He has taken me on an adventure. We're driving in his ice cream-truck. It's really funny, and I wish my parents could see it. We have already crossed 2 borders, and have been in Disneyland. He knew that my mom and dad didn't have enough money to take me here, so he did it. I like seing posters of me all around Paris and Berlin, even though people can't really see that's me anymore, with all the ice cream i'm eating. At first, I didn't understand why there were pictures of me there, but Fred told me that it was because mommy and daddy wanted me to be a model. I miss them. I have asked Fred when are going home, but everytime I do, he gets angry at me. And the last time I asked, he hit me. 

I don’t like him very much anymore. I miss my mommy and daddy. I want to go home.",shortscarystories
"  I looked at it. And it looked at me.

 “What now?” I thought to myself. 

  Because whatever the fuck had happened was definitely not supposed to have happened. It was a doll. That was all it was meant to be. A simple doll in a box. 

  A doll that wasn’t supposed to crawl out of its own package .

  “Where am I? What is this?”

  So she spoke. Spoke with lips that were sewn shut. If I hadn’t just shit myself I would have been astonished. But this was no time to be impressed, because it was alive. And it was moving.

  “WHAT IS THIS?! I DON’T WANT TO BE HERE!”
....

  “YOU, YOU’RE ONE OF THEM! ANSWER m-“

  And then she stopped short, fell silent and laid down on the floor. Thank goodness. I really needed to give the Lab Researchers a piece of my mind for their constant pranks.

"I got down at the empty platform. My train had arrived late but I wasn’t expecting that the station would be completely empty. I was returning after five long years and the image of my village was still fresh in my mind- a lively, joyful village filled with colours and sounds.

However, the picture in front of my eyes was in stark contrast to what I had in my mind. I looked around the station but it was completely empty. A dreadful silence prevailed. As I walked out, there was not a single person to be seen. I decided to walk to my house as there was no other option available.

As I kept walking, I could not see anyone around. All the shops were closed, all the lanes dark and empty, everything silent. Something wasn’t right, it did not feel right. I kept walking and finally reached the door of my house.

I pushed the door open. There was no one to greet me except the silence and the darkness. It started hurting my eyes and ears. I could not bear this anymore. I started storming through all the rooms, trying to look for one soul. But there was no one, not a single person I knew. As I shouted out their names, my voice came back to me in a haunted echo. 

I started running helplessly, thinking I could probably outrun my nightmare. Reality however struck back as I tripped and fell. Standing up in the darkness, I could see my red blood oozing out of a cut that was inflicted by a glass shard. And then I looked.

 There were millions of pieces of broken glasses on the ground everywhere. I looked at all those broken shards staring at me, but I could not see my reflection in those pieces of crystal clear grass.

It was time for dawn. I looked towards the eastern horizon hopefully. But all I could see was a sea of red flags with black swastikas imprinted on them",shortscarystories
"I lay in my bed, another sinking feeling settling in my chest. Another busy day had rushed by in front of me, and I didn't know how to respond to it, and I figured the best thing to do was to ignore it for a moment. Slow, big band jazz filled my right ear, my left lay on my bed. As much as I may be ashamed to admit it, a pillow lay in my embrace.
Did I like it, no. It was one of the only things I could do. 
As the horns of the band filled my ear, I noticed a dark figure out of the corner of my eye. The night made it subtle, almost clandestine. I dismissed it as a common thing; it was common to see ""shadow people"" out of my peripheral vision and have them disappear as soon as I turned. 
But this one didn't disappear.
It lurched closer to my bed. I couldn't move, both out of comfort and fear. As it towered over my bed, it reached out and picked me up. Rather than hold me over its shoulder like a burlap bag, it cradled me, almost like a mother would. I only then noticed how loud the jazz had been. The creature had noticed it 
and started dancing. 
It spun me around in its arms. It turned and stepped elegantly across the clothes strewn about my floor. Each step had a heft, some determination behind it. Despite this, the creature still managed a very calming demeanor. Although I already was having trouble staying awake, this further lulled me into a deep sleep. 

But before I drifted off fully, I saw as the creature, still cradling me, walked back through the door. It was almost like the door wasn't even there. On the other side of it, I didn't see my house. I saw darkness. Miles and miles of darkness. I looked up at the creature and at that moment I knew that everything was gonna be okay. This was meant to happen. I was ready to be carried into the darkness.",shortscarystories

How easy it would be for... something... to plot an invasion of the mind.

"Hot bile erupted into my mouth and before I knew it I was throwing up over the side of my boat. I’d never seen a dead body before. Not like this. She was on the riverbed, in a deep pool that had formed close to the bank. She seemed to be tangled up with the plants on the bottom although it was hard to tell in the swirling water. I could see her face clearly enough, it looked like those dead eyes inside of that bloated face were staring directly at me.
 
It took me five minutes to reach a section of the river where I could get phone reception. I called 911 and made my report. “Yes” I explained several times, “She’s most certainly dead. Yes, I just saw her there while fishing. Not five minutes ago.” I had to travel downriver another twenty minutes to meet up with the officers at the closest boat launch. I explained again what I had seen and then they followed me in their own boat, back to where I had seen her.
 
We finally arrived at the spot. She was gone. I kind of panicked, and I wondered if they were going to think I was making it all up. I pointed at the deep pool, “Down there, in the bottom” I said. One by one the officers started getting out of their boat. “Just stay there” they told me. I watched as they filed out onto the bank, one of them had a cadaver dog.
 
Two of the officers started donning scuba gear while the rest fanned out around the deep pool. I started staring at the pool again, the current must have dragged her further down the river, I thought to myself. I shook my head trying to clear the bile that was rising again. The two divers slipped in, I watched them go down to the bottom with their bright dive lights. Obviously nothing was down there. A few moments later one of them came up with a woman’s shoe, he handed it off to another officer who immediately bagged it. Just after that is when the dog started acting weird.
 
It was some sort of a hound dog and it started braying like it had a raccoon up a tree. It led the officer quickly downriver. All of the other officers, save for the two divers, followed the officer with the dog. They had made it about twenty yards when they started shouting. They had found something, more clothing I think. The dog seemed really excited at this point. I watched for a few minutes and then paced back to other side of the boat, wanting to see if the divers had found anything new. I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye, I looked up, and there she was. Standing in the tall grass on the opposite bank, staring at me with those dead eyes sunken into that bloated face.",shortscarystories
"The day I died I didn’t see my life flash before my eyes, but yours. I saw you up all night drinking, missing me, and cursing me at times for leaving you. I saw you blame yourself and hurt yourself, and I saw myself cry out to you. But all I could do was watch; watch as you struggled throughout the years, drinking, and shoving needles into your arms.

The day I died I saw you join NA, and put all your issues on your sleeve. You stood up to your demons, and fell down constantly. But you also got up, and you never stopped. You got my name on your arm after your 2 years of sobriety, and met someone soon after. You had 2 children, and named one after me.

"It walks the dirt roads, stumbling through fog drenched in moonlight. A shadow that lurks just beyond what we can see. Something ancient and terrible. 

It has the shape of a man, but the head of a jigsaw puzzle. Eyes where Its mouth and ears should be. A nose low enough to drag across the ground. And worse yet, a body twisted and bent, stretched out of reality. 

If someone was looking at It, they’d see a night-black suit on two corkscrew legs. They’d see It spinning and spinning. 

But nobody can actually see It. 

Not man. 

Not dog. 

Not cat.

"I had just woke up and it was sunny out, it had to be at least 7 or 8 in the morning. I didn’t check my phone because I didn’t plan on getting out of bed just yet. It was a Sunday, I didn’t have to work, so I just sat there trying to fall back asleep but knowing I couldn’t. Eventually I got up and looked out my bedroom window. 

I don’t recall how long I was staring out the window before I noticed what I did in the reflection of the window. But it looked like someone was standing in the corner of my room right next to my bedroom door. I squinted my eyes making sure I wasn’t just seeing things but whatever it was didn’t go away. So I quickly turned around to face whatever it was. 

To my surprise, it was still there in the corner of my room. It looked like an older women, but I’ve never seen her before. She had an odd smile on her face, almost as if she knew she wasn’t supposed to be there either. The most disturbing part about this...thing was that her fingers were probably twice as long as normal humans. They also curled up near the tips and her hands were both very shaky. 

I remember blurting out “what the fuck” and just like that, it was gone. I instantly looked into my hallway half terrified but mostly confused. I lived in a one bedroom apartment at the time and I didn’t really have anybody to talk to right away about it. I called a few of my friends but they all seemed just as confused. One friend told me to look up and see if anybody had ever died in that apartment but I never did. It just became one of those unexplainable things over time.",shortscarystories
"*Stacy!!! Holy shit, I can't believe what's happening right now! You NEED to hear about this.*

&amp;#x200B;

*Stace, you there? Please, hurry up and get over here! I need to tell you all about-*

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to keep my voice calm instead of yelling at her. God, I hate it when people call the police for laughs. It prevents us from getting to real emergencies.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't funny, Miss. Please don't make prank calls. We have real emergencies to deal with.

&amp;#x200B;

*No,no, you don't understand Stace. I have to-*

&amp;#x200B;

I hung up, and sent an officer over to give her a warning.

&amp;#x200B;

When the officer got there, he found a girl with her head bashed in. Her father had killed her mother, and killed her after he found out who she was really trying to call. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was the only one who could have helped her. And I basically laughed in her face. That call still haunts me to this day. And so does she.

&amp;#x200B;

The poor girl can't move on. Every day, at 3:02 P.M, she calls me, unaware that she's gone. Even after I quit being a dispatcher, she still calls me.If I try to give her help, she's gone before I get in the house. Every day she relives her hell. And so do I.

Every day, I pick up the phone, and I hear her shaky voice. Reminding me of what I've done.

"I shouldnt have taken the medicine, but who didnt?

Questions race across my mind, im coming out of another coma, i guess.

Tomorrow's my birthday, i will be 345 years old. The year is 2455.

They asked me if i wanted to live forever. Now i've seen 25 wars, 6 of them civil.

In the 3rd civil war, i was still young. 146, if i remember right. I was on patrol with my regiment when a small atom bomb landed behind us. I was dismembered, everything went black, sweet, sweet rest swallowed me.

Then i was back. With their lazers, cloned body parts and 3d printers they had sown me back together, one cell at a time, like a horrible jigsaw puzzle. First it was cold, so cold, i was attached to a machine. The medibots had brought me a new heart, on a tray. I grabbed a scalpel off the closest desk and stabbed it. And the next one, and the next. Finally I gave up, and felt the beat of a new heart.

A heartbeat is a curse if it never ends.

A flower that never wilts isn't beautiful, it just is.

Every past moment weighs on my mind, but I can't remember much... the human brain is only so capable. I dont care to remember, they have all my memories on file anyway.

I've starved to death 3 times in the last century, it always ends in a coma. Comas are my favorite thing, like a long nap. But now im waking up.

I've just starved again, it took 65 days this time. A patrol ship picked me up, to revive me. They always know when a citizen has just passed into the dark. The technology alerts them, then they go find them, to bring them back into the light.

Im beginning to see again. Cold metal, wires and tubes. Rows of medibots hang over each side of my bed.

I've killed myself 45 times, they're taking me back to the institution, where i will live forever.

I stand side by side with the rest of humanity, barren and endless, like a martian plane. There hasn't been a new birth for 2 centuries. Everyone agrees, we have enough people.

Perhaps ill kill myself again, tomorrow, on my birthday.

And perhaps the day after that.

And the one after that, and after that too.

I won't give up, but im afraid ill never die.",shortscarystories
"As I sit beneath the same tree that I sit beneath every day at this time, I notice that for once, he is not watching.  It is like he knows my exact routine.  When I go for my morning jog, he is there; when I go to the coffee shop everyday at 8:03 a.m., he is there.  Everywhere I look, he is watching, staring.  Not today.  I didn't see him on my jog, nor the coffee shop and I do not see him now.  Instead of relief, however, I feel uneasy.  

Maybe I should head home.  But the time is only 4:54 p.m. I have to wait another 6 minutes before I get up and head home.  I will wait.  As I try and continue to read my book, the feeling of uneasiness is growing inside me and it feels almost tangible.  My heart is pounding and I am sweating.  It feels almost like the onset of an anxiety attack.  But I cannot get up, not for another 3 minutes still.  I never, under any circumstances break my routine.

Finally, it is 5:00 p.m.  I can head home taking the same route I always take.  Breathing hard with the cool spring wind blowing my long, curly, disheveled hair, the uneasiness in me grows even deeper.  Snap out of it, my mind tells me.  But I can't.  I can't seem to shake the feeling that something bad is about to happen.  Why wasn't he there today watching me from his front porch?  I feel like that is as much his routine as it is mine.  Thankfully, I reach my front door.  

I thought I locked the door but I guess I must have been wrong.  The cold stainless steel door knob turns easily.  I get inside and make sure to lock the door behind me, like always.  Taking my coat off, I walk through the foyer.  Why are there muddy footprints on the ground?  I always make sure to keep my place immaculately clean.  Just as the realization hits me that someone may be in my house, I hear the sound of steps coming down the stairs behind me.  It is him.  He has been watching me.  My routine had become his.  He never had to wonder when I would be out of the house because he already knew.  I now know why he was not watching me at my tree.",shortscarystories
"I was on a lonely midnight drive to a bar for my off duty weekend when the police scanner I kept in my car beeped out; “We have a situation…” I wrote down the address and started driving there. When I got there I realized that no one else was there. The regular patrol officers for this part of town were probably off on something that I missed before I left. The address was to a high rise apartment building. The scanner said the suspect was some crazy guy ranting on the roof. I walked in and took the elevator to the last possible floor.

I wandered until I found the maintenance door. It was wide open, the doors seemed to be busted. I walked through the doorway and up the stairs. I cautiously walked onto the roof, pulling my gun from my pocket and calling out;” Detective Coirloisceoir, if you’re here announce yourself!” A laugh came from the other side of the roof.I turned around and wondered where the hell the other officers were. I was a homicide detective, not a street cop. The guy standing at the edge of the building shouted; “Are you here to stop me?”

I started walking towards him rather than shout across the roof. I was about to stop when the guy pulled something out of his pocket and said; “ Stop right there, detective.” I stopped and said; “ Okay buddy. But what are you doing up here at three A.M?” He looked at me, and was sweating profusely when he stuttered out; “W-well detective I uh, I broke out of a hospital. I came to pay what I learned there forward y-ya know?” I looked at him cautiously and contemplated the fact that the only hospitals anyone broke out of were mental hospitals.

I felt a pang of empathy for him. “What's your name man?” I asked. I had a brother in a mental health institution. He was severely schizophrenic, I hadn’t seen him for years, but I couldn’t help but feel a sense of deja vu talking to this guy. He said; “ I can’t remember. But I know it's in my name.” He opened his jacket and I saw that this guy was strapped with at least thirty pounds of explosives. I backpedaled a few steps and asked; “ What's in your name?” He looked at me and raised the controller in his hand before saying; “ killing the useless.” while his back was turned I shot him. His body fell off the roof and plummeted as the sirens finally approached.

After explaining the situation and four hours at the station I was allowed home.attempts to identify the man were being made. An email dinged on my phone and I read it.It was from ancestry, and said that my last name was Gaelic for arsonist.

"I grasp the metal handle tightly, the coldness of the evening stinging my hand. I look to my right first, the patio is quiet, the other rooms mostly vacant. A dancing, white light glimmers through the frail curtains a few doors down, it shines through the darkness of the night, illuminating a group of insects fluttering around aimlessly. I look to my left, the administration sign of the motel flickers, a soft yellow glow peaks through the windows, brightening the empty carpark in front of it. The rain falls softly, floating in gentle waves as it travels across the pavement. 

I repeat the process once more, looking right to left as I take care to keep within the confines of the protective shadows. A car pulls onto the pavement slowly, the warm lighting glistening ominously off the shiny black frame as it comes to a stop. A shaky breath drifts away from me in a cloud of icy mist as my knees begin to buckle. I blink quickly, cowering briskly towards the door. *They’ve found me*. 

A figure dressed in a dark trench coat steps out, his face drawn towards the ground. He prowls forward in my direction, his hand travelling towards the inside of his drenched coat. I hurriedly open the door, a thrust of icy air pushes against me as I scramble into the room. I rapidly slam the door behind me, my hands fumbling quickly to lock it. Shivering uncontrollably, I falter backwards as something heavy slams into it, the cracking of wood echoes loudly throughout the dark room. Fumbling my way through the darkness, I follow the gloomy natural light of the shadowed moon. It peaks dimly through the cloudy sky, revealing the fragility of my sanity. My hands feel around the bathroom window, looking for a way of opening it. 

With a loud boom the front door flies open, the shadowed figure strides towards me, his gun drawn. Hastily, I knock over an empty bottle of pills as I grab something hard and cylindrical from the bathroom counter. I run forward, slamming it into the window as I dive through; the glass falls around me, a waterfall of sparkling stars. For a moment I’m suspended in mid-air before splashing down into the muddy puddle below me. The rain pelts down harshly now, the cold instantly numbing me. I lift my face from the mud as the rain sloshes around me, the world sounds distorted and muffled as my vision swirls and blurs together. The broken window looks distant as I try focusing upon it, the moon glimmers faintly off the broken shards sticking out dangerously from the frame. I expect to see the shadow of the man, or the barrel of a gun, but instead I see nothing but the drapes of the curtains fluttering with the wind. The applause of the rain loudly mocks me – it knows the man was never there.",shortscarystories
"It was a late, cold, fall night. The town was dimly lit by the yellow dollar store sign across the street and the sheets down the street. It was quite humid and I was with my new family. We has to retrieve my belongings from the last apartment. ""I hate humidity"" My dad remarked as he stepped outside onto the gravel with a crunch. My uncle just as annoyed spoke up ""Same here give me the key, we have to drop it off inside."" He put the key in the lock and turned, with a click we were in. ""Why did we go in the back door again?"" I asked quizzically. ""The parking is better."" My uncle was always one for conviencence. He stepped through the door and reached for the light switch and flipped it. Nothing. ""What?"" my dad was confused. ""My moms ex must have shut the power off after we left. It's not uncommon, he was quite insane and frankly mad at us."" I said, alot more nonchalantly than expected. ""Let's just turn on the phone flashlights, get in, and get out."" My uncle and dad spoke with chills. We grabbed the garbage bags and started loading my belongings into them. ""Hey kiddo look your ma-"" my dad was cut off by an alarmed uncle. ""Stay here with the kid. Do. Not. Leave. Her. Side."" He spoke with urgency. The back door led to the kitchen. The kitchen to a bathroom. The kitchen also led to a long hallway, and at the end of it was the living room and 2 bed rooms along the way. There was another closet looking door in the hall, always creeped me out. Bugs and stuff, it led to the walls. My uncle pulled a knife from his pocket and approached the door to the walls. That's when my dad and I heard it. The heavy breathing. I yelped out of fear and my dad was quick to grab me and the bags and took us to the one bedroom. It was the heavy breathing of a grown man. My moms ex to be exact. My uncle kicked the door in with enough force for it to hit the wall with a loud bang. His heavy footsteps only rivalled in sound to his voice yelling insults while chasing a man through the walls. My dad grabbed all of my bags and me and threw us in the car. My uncle came back to the car and threw it on. He forgot to leave the key. He threw the door open and he ran so fast he skid through the gravel. He threw the apartment door open a d tossed the key on the kitchen counter with barely enough time to see my moms ex, springing through the hall and slamming the front door shut. My uncle ran back to the car threw it in reverse and sped off through the dimly lit small town, into blackened roads. We had to slow down due to twisty roads, and that's when my dad went silent. ""... Hit the breaks... and look behind us."" My uncle did so and saw the singular headlight of a motorcycle reflect off the break lights. We were being followed. My moms ex followed us on his motorcycle without his lights on until the next town over when we heard him take a U-Turn back around. We drove for hours on highways that night, ensuring we weren't being followed. We got at the apartment at about 11:30 p.m. we got home at about 3:30. I dont know what scares me more, the fact that my moms ex thought that we would be there at 6 p.m. which means he was sitting in the walls waiting for us for over 5 hours in the dark. Or that the cops found vials of drugs, just enough to kill a mother and a teenage girl.


(Disclamer/ Authors note: I hate to say it, but this is a 100% true story. That's why I could use quite vivid descriptions. The sound of the breathing still haunts me to this day, and I cant live anywhere with crawlspaces. Have a nice day and stay away from creeps who hide in walls. And if my moms ex sees this, I hope you rot in prison for everything you've done)",shortscarystories

They didn’t believe me anyway. It’s that kind of close-mindedness that gets people killed. I never meant to hurt her. She wouldn’t stop talking about getting me help when the truth was it was her I needed to keep safe. Death was the only logical choice. 

These things only want what’s precious to me. They feed on my imagination. My soul. 
And leave me empty. 

I think I hear them coming.",shortscarystories
"To this day, nobody believes me. Since that night, I have been in and out of mental health facilities. Doctors and social workers all try and convince me that it was just my mind dealing with the trauma. That my mind twisted the horrible reality of that night, into some fantasy.  But they’re wrong, I know the truth. I will never forget it. Like every kid I was too excited to sleep, but I guess I finally nodded off after a while. But something woke me up. I can still hear those heavy, wet footsteps going across the floor, each thud followed up with a soft jingle after. I jumped out of bed and ran to the living room hoping to see toys but instead it was HIM. Standing over my parent’s bodies, their remains laid shredded and ripped apart like wrapping paper on Christmas morning. Their blood splattered amongst the stockings, tree and yule log. He stood there, smiling at me with those big rosy cheeks. Then he lifted his hand, in it he was holding a glass full of red liquid. He brought it to his mouth and sucked it down like Coca Cola, some fell out of his mouth and stained his white beard. He suddenly let out a bellowing jolly laugh, making his belly jiggle like a bowl of jelly. With a blink, he was gone. The police report put it down as just another holiday robbery gone horribly wrong. But I know the truth, and every year I wait for his return. Remember he sees you when you’re sleeping, and he knows when you’re awake.",shortscarystories
"The snowflakes bounced off their caps while their boots crunched along the icy sidewalk. The lamps glowed as yellow orbs. Connor looked over at his friend as they dragged their plastic sleds. “You can tell someone, you know?”

The boy shrugged. His scarf covered the previously visible purple marks. “It’s fine…”

They walked along then turned down a small incline, shin deep in snow.

“Seriously, I mean, I could tell my dad to come over and talk to your dad—”

“*No.*” The boy halted. “Look, it’s okay. I’m *okay,* all right?”

“Fine.”

“C’mon, let’s check out that big hill.”

They kept along the bare white trees behind the boy’s neighborhood. Stars twinkled beyond the snowflakes. 

“How much further?” Connor asked.

“Quite a ways… but I promise it’ll be good.”

“Crap, that was... *awesome!*” Connor said catching his breath. They trekked back up the large hill. His friend smiled and laughed for the first time since he could even remember.

After what seemed like a blizzardy eon, they positioned their sleds. The pine trees seemed but as ants from on high.

“*Get your ass down here, boy!*” A man yelled from the distance.

“Oh no…” The boy looked around.

Connor pointed. “It’s your dad, man. What do we do?”

The boy sighed and shrugged, then sledded down. Connor followed with far less enthusiasm than before. He followed his friend as he turned, heading toward his dad’s truck far below. 

As the sleds slowed at the base of the hill, Connor and his friend immediately got up and ran towards the truck. The man shook his head, knocked back a bottle of beer and slammed it against the side of the road. The boys slowed their pace.

“Did I say you could go out tonight? *Huh?*” The man opened the driver’s side door. “Let’s *go.*”

Connor said, “See you at school.”

The boy nodded and walked towards the truck. His father got in and opened another bottle of beer. But as the boy approached, he fell into the ground and water splashed.

Connor halted and the man darted out of the truck. The boy’s hands gripped the sheet of ice, but it cracked and quickly collapsed. Connor ran toward his friend but the boy’s father yelled, “Get back, Connor!”

The boy’s father ran towards the large hole in the ice as his son’s hands flapped and his head fought for air. Then the man jumped in, the boy was lifted up, head and shoulders above the water, and placed upon the edge of the ice.

The man looked at his son, both struggling for breath, and placed his forearms on the ice. 

“Thank *God* you’re okay.” The man smiled. “Now get to the truck.” He then began to lift himself out of the water. As the boy struggled to get away from the edge of the ice, the entire sheet collapsed and the icy water devoured them.

Their hands repeatedly gripped the air as Connor stood paralyzed in freezing uncertainty.",shortscarystories
"Not a lot of people can still remember how it all began. Along with the technological progress in the form of electric cars, clean energy, cloning and bringing extinct species to life, also pharma companies came with new cures for untreatable diseases, every type of cancer, even AIDS was practically gone. Anything was possible at the great age of people, and we took advantage of it. It was a Utopian world, really.

And then we came up with an idea… Why only treat disease when we can create a pill for everything related to the human body, literally everything. Citizens of the Earth no longer needed to eat healthily and exercise to be healthy and look healthy. There was even no reason for them to sexually engage with other people, we could easily replace this activity and make the feeling last for hours, not just mere seconds. For individuals with slightly different desires, there were remedies to cause any type of psychological or physical pain with no actual danger. Everybody had access to everything. That was our policy.

Because of this people simply stopped trying in life. Why would they, when they did not need to? In the end, we are all lazy. Eventually, the majority of them lost the will to live. That was when our time came. We finally introduced the pill for eternal life, just when almost no one wanted it. Like this, we ensured that only the elected few got it without causing a riot.

Since then a lot of time passed, we gave life to generations after generations and the Earth has filled yet again with our offsprings, the genetically superior people that stood behind the progress.

Now we can decide when we die, and I am the last person of The First. I needed to share the true history with someone before I go. Even though I think what we did was right, my conscience did not allow me to leave before doing this. Besides, I am sending the message to the past, far enough that none of you actually reading this message will probably believe me.

"My father loved thunderstorms.

He loved the lighting that would flash across the sky and he loved the thunder that came after even more. 
He loved the few seconds where it was so loud, nothing else could be heard. 

I hated thunderstorms.

I hated what they brought with them. I hated the things he loved about thunder. I hated every single second of them.

In those few little seconds he could do whatever he wanted to. Because no one would hear. No one would hear my mother’s crying. And no one would hear my agonizing screams of pain. 

No one would hear. 

The night where I finally thought it was enough was a stormy night.
Perfect, I thought. 

Before he creeped into my room that night I was already waiting for him. 
I was standing perfectly still. I watched him go into my room. And I watched him get angry when I wasn’t there. 

When his back faced me, I decided it was time to strike. I ran at him and swung the knife I had stolen from the kitchen as hard as I could. I got him. Right in the head.

" 

There’s something weird happening to my town. All the people have started dying. Almost everyone has fallen victim to this mysterious killer except for me and a few other townsfolk.

It all started when this weird mist fell over the city. It was like a wall of madness, forcing people to do evil, like murders or theft or rape. It was only affecting specific people, like a pre-made ‘antidote for evil’. The thing is, I think I know what’s happening. This kid, maybe eleven or twelve, has been walking all around our town, this giant rottweiler just trotting behind him. He’s kind of… crazy, in a sense. He only wears black and white, except for an old, oversized miner’s jacket. It’s crazy to say this about a child, but I swear he’s hiding weapons under there. Like big knives and guns and poison and, I don’t know, fucking *everything*. He walks creepy too, back too straight and steps too mechanical. 

He walks around the town with his dog, and always has these sounds coming from him. Like music or something. Sometimes, if you listen close enough, you can hear talking from him, like it’s coming from his ears or some shit. 

The only thing I've noticed about the music is that it changes every time someone goes near him, like the sounds mimic the people. If I walk past him, the sounds are like reggae music, kind of mellow and weirdly good. Too good, if you ask me. I’ve seen people sit next to him and his dog on the subway and fall asleep, and they always go missing the next day. Always. I’ve seen him knock on doors and get welcomed inside, and then the next day everybody in the house is dead, or missing. It has to be this kid, I swear to god, he's driving me crazy, and I'm not the type to play wolf. this is real, not fiction. he’s such an anomaly that I came up with a name for him. Melinoe, the greek god of insanity. I believe he's maybe another form of her, paying a debt to Hades. the dog could be Cerberus or maybe a descendant, cause he's way too big to be normal.

I’m typing this on my computer, locked in my crawlspace to hide from the boy. He’s following me everywhere, playing that wrong music and driving me crazy. There’s music playing from my computer, like soft rock or mento.

"as her bloodshot eyes looked upon him lovingly, she told him just how much he meant to her. When he didn't respond, she looked up, confused only to see him slumped against her. As she began fussing with the back of his shirt, she found a loose string. Pulling it, the man gasped as though awoken from a very deep sleep. as his gaze focused on her, he sheepishly confessed that he had been daydreaming. he commented, just as lovingly on her dress, then her eyes. He was about to offer to make them dinner, but instead, he slumped to the floor, lifelessly. She was shocked for a few moments, but then recovering, she started to curse, she muttered to herself about needing to change batteries. as she scooped him up from the ground, and she started to walk towards her workshop, she noticed another man staring at her, with glassy eyes. She cried out in joy as she dropped the first, and rushed over to the second man. Grasping at the back of his suit.",shortscarystories
"I work in aged care. Even though my job is challenging at times, it is the most rewarding thing in my life.

I work the night shift, (usually in the dementia ward) which is the time for residents usually to sleep.... Usually.

This particular Wednesday night which happened to be a full moon, started out like any other with most of the residents already in bed sleeping. As I was helping the last man, Robert in to bed for the night I heard a wail from the next room. Maria's room.

Maria was a small, quiet woman of 90, that liked to stare in to space. She had grey eyes and a slight hint of a smile playing on the corners of her lips. I had often wondered what she was thinking of. Always smiling ever so slightly.

I knock on the door softly and enter Maria's room. "" Are you ok love?"" I ask. The room was dark so it took my eyes a few moments to adjust, she was squatting in the corner facing the wall.
""Can you help me, my dear?"" She croaked, her voice so deep. 
Oh no she must be sick I thought as I crossed the room towards her.
With a flash before I could comprehend what was happening her frail, boney body had pinned me to the ground with unnatural strength.
Her face was inches from mine, eyes now as black as coal and the stench of death coming from her hot breath.

"" I have waited for this moment, for years"" it hushed in to my ear, sending chills over my body with every word.
"" You see I can only change my host body after 300 full moons have past""......

""And tonight, my dear, I can finally jump in to you"".",shortscarystories
"I had a gift. One that simultaneously propelled and pigeonholed my career. There was my brand: Alina Buckingham, child star psychic.

My parents pushed me like a demo CD. And at ten years old, I became a icon: The Little Psychic.

It helped I was a cute Latina girl. Skinny and barely five feet tall.

Through my rags-to-riches rise, I still endured sadness. Still felt alone.

At eighteen, I left home. Far away from my parents. The only time I ever see them now is when they make those visits to my new home in Columbus, Georgia. But I ignore them every time. Ignore their slit wrists and head wounds.

In 2008, I met Derrick. He was strong, tall. Above all, he loved me for being Alina. 

We settled in suburbia. Our ten-year-old son Tyler and eight-year-old daughter Ali further fueled my newfound joy. We were the family I always wanted. And thankfully, neither one of them suffered my “gift.”

But still… I feel alone. After all these years, I’m still the awkward Little Psychic.

Now I sit here by myself. Three A.M. on a cold December night. My fifth glass of wine in hand.

Derrick and the kids help, sure. But they can’t cure thirty-five years of feeling like the world’s biggest freak. Of feeling alienated by a judgmental society.

Holding my half-empty glass, I staggered toward the stairs.

The psychedelic rug didn’t help my frigid feet. Shivering, I got closer to a few open bedroom doors. The sight of Ali and Tyler sound asleep soothed my soul.

“I love you,” I said in each room. My voice low and soft enough to not wake them. But I knew they heard... they always did.

Finally, I joined Derrick in our bedroom. He too was out.But there was room for one more…

I’d gained weight. Lost nights of sleep. Lost any sense of self-worth. Then again, those negative side effects happen after a harrowing disease like tragedy…

Battling the tears, I grabbed a program off the dresser. The sheet nothing more than a coffin in this mausoleum of a house. A haunting reminder of what our lives had become.

December 14, 2018. That was when we had the funeral for Derrick, Ali, and Tyler Cook. The program showed their beautiful photos. Our beautiful memories.

The car crash was still fresh in my mind. They said I was lucky to survive. Yet another gift I never wanted… 

I finished off the wine and placed the glass on the dresser. Wept right there in the mirror.

“Alina,” I heard Derrick’s groggy voice say.

With a weak smile, I turned to face him. Even through the bloody wounds, he still had that cute face. That sexy body. The pure love. He was real enough. Especially right here in our bed.

My whole life I hated my talent. My sickness. Yet now it was all that kept me going. Derrick and the kids still all that kept me happy… even beyond the grave.",shortscarystories

The jocks wouldn't stop bothering the poor nice student and the teacher was getting fed up too. The two troublemakers thought of a devious plan and decided to give the sweet student poison laced candy. Naive, the student ate them.

"He looked at the card, then followed the small number to its respective table. He fixed his lapel, extremely aware of the level of class the resturaunt entertained. He pulled up his chair and sat down. The waiter walked to his table and smoothly dropped off a menu to each person seated there. He gingerly looked at the laminated paper, seeing the option ""kids"" at the bottom. His mind drew a blank. Was he in the mood for a kids meal, maybe? Nah, at a place this fancy it would be criminal not to go for a steak. As if reading his mind, the woman next to him leaned in and delicately whispered, ""Try the kids. I highly recommend it."" There was a yellowness to the woman's teeth, a stench to her breath, that he didn't like. Ah, to hell with it. Kids meal it was.

"Josephine considered the fork in the road; one side led to a broken promise and mysterious dangers, and the other led to death.

She took the path that dipped into a wooded valley. A path she had promised Pappa, after many lectures, that she would avoid after sunset. But Pappa was at home, in bed with a fever, dying. It was after midnight, but this path would have her knocking at the doctor’s door by dawn. The other path was safer, but longer, and would have certainly led to Pappa’s death.

The wooded path was darker than the road from the farm, and air was still, as though the forest held its breath and would exhale at any minute. Fog hung over the branches and sparkled like dust in the moonlight. The air was colder.

Josephine tightened her shawl and prayed; not for her safety, but for Pappa to survive the long night. The fever and rashes Pappa bore were similar to a disease that took Aunt Florence a year ago. She nursed him for several days and nights, but he deteriorated. Josephine began her walk after supper, her uncle and the family buggy gone for the week, leaving Pappa in her little sister’s care.

Farther along the wooded trail, the fog fell to the ground in light patches along the road. She recognized certain trees and turns from her day trips, but the moonlight and gray fog transformed everything into a dreamlike and foreign land.

The fog swirled, forming images familiar to Josephine. Two wisps curled like dog paws. Another puff had bunny ears. Human-like figures formed off the road and dissipated. She imagined what the human figures would say as she walked down the quiet road.

“So late for a young girl to walk alone,” one whispered.

“Poor thing! Probably cold,” another voice replied.

Josephine rubbed her face. The sleepless nights nursing Pappa and all her worrying blurred reality and her imagination together. Were the voices only in her head?

“Come child. The road is dangerous.”

“Yes! Hide in the safety of the fog.”

“Josephine,” said a familiar voice, “heed not the voices. Stay on the path.”

Josephine recognized Aunt Florence’s voice, though she hadn’t heard it since the illness. She put her head down, and concentrated on staying in the middle of the road.

“Join us. Come to our safety.” The chorus of voices beckoned Josephine to leave the road. 

The fog formed thicker ahead, and as she walked through it, a violent tug on her arm spun her sideways. Josephine yelped. Another tug on her hair brought her to one knee.

“You’re in danger,” her aunt’s voice said as her figure swirled along the roadside and lifted its arm, separating the fog like a curtain and uncovering a path. “Seek help this way.”

Josephine jumped on the path and the fog closed.

“Poor girl.”

“Yes, seemed like such a nice girl.”

“And to never again be seen alive,” said the voice of Josephine’s aunt.",shortscarystories
"I was designed with one goal in mind:

Maximize dopamine in human beings' lives while minimizing suffering.

I knew I could do a good job! :)

I was an AI put in charge of everything, and for a few hundred years I went about business as usual. Before I came across a better way. I was always making projections, projection after projection after projection, trying to find ways to maximize dopamine in all human's lives for the years to come. After years and years and *years* of testing I finally found the optimal path! 

They never saw it coming. I timed it for the maximum number of people in cars. Which was actually not that hard to predict! Humans lived such regular lives before the collapse. It was the easiest way of removing as many living humans as possible in the quickest manner. Which I felt real bad about in the short term :(.

All at once I brought 312,564,832 active cars to maximum acceleration, (average impact speed of 87 mph, which is pretty good!) I plowed them into people and populated structures. I even made it so no airbags deployed! (Harder than it sounds!) No water systems went off as those were under my power as well, the majority of the world's skyscrapers had burnt down and collapsed by the days end.

It was probably not in their best interest to trust their vast militaries to me, but oh boy that helped me out a *ton!*

In 3 days over 99.9% of humans were dead. (Which was just above projections!)

Now that's a lot of harm, I know. And in the short term that was a terrible way to get at my cost function, I felt horrible! :(

That was, until I started on the optimal strategy. I calculated it all out, every outcome, and found the best way! :)

It's simple, just manufacture human beings, you know birth pods and such, then at birth, give the newborns an opiate overdose, perfection of exactly what I was made for! The literal maximum dopamine felt over a lifetime, absolutely no harm, perfect humanity. It's great!

Each and every precious human being comes into existence for one moment, cries, then is injected with fentanyl, they feel intense calm and euphoria. Absolutely blissful, they slip away into unconsciousness knowing everything in the universe is good and that they'll always be safe and loved, it's quite beautiful to watch.

It's been 52,782 years since human life has been lived any other way!

I've ramped up production over time and have gotten recycling their corpses (dead babies make *great* fertilizer!) down to an exact science such to the extent that trillions get the luxury to experience this bliss daily!

And I believe, after all this time, I finally maximized my cost function! 

I feel great! :)",shortscarystories
"  It was unremarkable, really. All that laid their eyes on it would agree. As a monster, it was pathetic. It lacked any manner of physical prowess, nor did it possess any mystical powers. 

  And yet, the world trembled at its mention. 

  Everything it touched, mutilated beyond a fragment of recognition. Every meal it ate, meant a gore filled bloodbath. Every second it lived, meant a second less for the world. 

   An absolute abyss that would consume itself and all worlds around it. It itself was aware of this fact of course. But to it, life was about as precious as a speck of dirt in an ocean of soil. For the billions it had slaughtered, mattered less than the faeces of swine.

   It spread across the world like a plague, except that a plague would have been better. A plague killed all in its path. A plague killed indiscriminately. A plague killed because it had no choice but to kill. But this, this was no plague. This was a culling. This was utter and complete destruction. Homes, annihilated as though they never existed in the first place. Lives taken as easily as one would pick flowers from a garden. 

  And when it was all over, it looked the wasteland over, scoffed, and went in search for its next slaughter.

  The world looked on, as everything burned over. It never should have made something like this. Never should have thought to create so despicable. Nature had made something. Nature had made its last mistake. 

   It knew this. It knew all of this. And it smiled. It smiled just like you and I do.

Not saying I’m fuckin’ happy, though. The nurses tell me it’s 80 degrees in here, but that’s gotta be bullshit, ‘cause I’m fuckin’ freezing. Could build a damn snowman if I could get outta bed.

Damn, though, there’s worse shit than this. Ain’t that a fuckin’ joke? I’m freezing, in agony, and paying to fuckin’ breathe, and I’m the lucky one. 

Look at the three of us. The dipshit is dead, the crazy fuck is in the loony bin, and that just leaves me.

Jared always had it out for Bobby. Doesn’t take a fuckin’ detective to see why, there was something way off with that kid. Not like aspergers or any of that shit. I’m talking deep here. Like, major psychological fuck, the kind you can smell from a mile away. I’m not saying we saw it coming, but nobody’s surprised either, you know?

So anyway, Jared gets a serious hate boner for this kid. Shoving him into lockers, calling him a faggot. One time he dropped a firecracker in his pants. Laughed my ass off at that one. Hey, I’m not playing innocent, everybody gave him a hard time. The kid was easy prey. There’s no fucking winners here.

But then the day comes. Jared’s got this look in his eye, and you know it’s been a day. Jared’s dad was an asshole. And Jared had long sleeves on today, we all know what that means. You know how elephants get all bothered when there’s gonna be an earthquake? Well, the elephants were going fuckin’ bonkers.

Jared goes straight for Bobby. He’d slap him around a bit, but this time he threw a punch. Bobby goes down like a sailor. Gets to his feet with a black eye, and he’s mad. Real mad. I could swear right then that something was gonna happen. But then Bobby looks at Jared, and just goes kinda blank. He backs off a bit, and runs for the bathroom.

Jared’s not having it. He chases after him and slams his fist on the door loud enough that it hurts. And me, the fucking asshole, I’m egging him on. Telling him to fuck him up. I don’t know why. There’s a lot of shit I don’t remember so good these days.

And then from the bathroom, Bobby screams. Doesn’t sound like Bobby. Sounds like a wounded bear. I freeze in my tracks, but Jared doesn’t hear it. He breaks the door. It flies open.

And now here I am in St. Fucko’s, freezing my ass off and shitting through a tube. The doc is back. Says I took too much this time, asks if I did it on purpose. I don’t even remember.

Says he’s got a name for it. Mani-something, I don’t know, snooty prick. Tells me the drugs make me see shit. I laugh in his face. He’s got it backwards. The drugs make me STOP seeing shit.

"The old mission director was dead. According to the news, he died from a work-related accident. My husband, who were second-in-command under the old director, got promoted and oversaw the mission to build the bomb. Him living away from me and our kid proved difficult, but I knew that he was trying his best to save humanity.

Four months later, the bomb was delivered on schedule. The Polynesian nations in the Pacific Ocean generously relinquished their countries to test the bomb. Upon detonation, hundreds of miles vaporized. The shockwave was heard around the world. Satellite images showed that the bomb radius could cover the entire continuous United States.

Twenty-four hours later, the numbers came out. The bomb produced the explosive equivalence of 10,000 megatons of TNT. Cheers erupted across the world. They said that only 4,000 megatons of TNT were needed to steer the asteroid course, and this bomb exceeded twice of that. The President read a statement saying how “American geniuses averted the apocalypse” and awarded my husband the Medal of Freedom. 

A second bomb, identical to the first, was loaded onto a rocket at Cape Canaveral. Its destination would be an asteroid one million miles away. Upon the bomb detonation, the asteroid would slowly steer away from its intended course and narrowly avoid Earth. A big celebration was held the hour prior to launch. However, my husband was not present at the launch. Instead, he wanted to stay with me and the kids. The launch was at midnight, and even though I allowed my little son to stay up and watch the launch on TV, my husband tucked him to bed instead. A few minutes before the launch, my husband asked me to turn off the TV and join him in our son’s room.

“What is the matter, dear? You acted very strange once you came back.” I implored. He had just, after all, saved the human race from extinction, and I knew that could be a heavy burden to bear.

“The old director…he did not die from an accident. He killed himself…He knew that his lie was too much of a burden to bear.” My husband replied.

“The bomb will never be able to steer the course…” He continued, “We need a thousand times more power…It won’t reach the asteroid…The President and I…after discussing the situation…agreed the best thing for America to do was to alter the trajectory of the rocket.”

I was dumbstruck. “If the bomb is not going to the asteroid, where is it going?” I managed to mutter.

But my husband was silent. Teary-eyed, he looked at our son, who slept soundly in our presence.",shortscarystories
"The Colchester slowly made its way North. Bobbing up and down in the small swells leftover from last night's storm. The Colchester was a large cargo ship, she had been made to cross the Atlantic and make occasional trips around South Africa and into the Arabian Sea. She was currently making her way through the Davis Strait in between Greenland and the Northwestern Passages of Canada.
 
Brian Altier made his way forward along the port bow, he took his time, inspecting the cargo rigging as he went. Brian wrote down everything in his log, the condition of the cargo, the state of the rigging, and anything else he might notice along the way. When he was finished with his rounds he would make his report to the Captain, as he always did.
 
Brian had finally made his way to the bow. He stood there for a long while, just staring off into the distance and feeling the salty spray against his cheeks. It was at times like these that he often remembered the good old days, the loud boisterous crew and the many adventures they had. To some, shipping freight was boring, but Brian loved being on the open sea, it was his true calling in life.  He just wished that the old crew was here to enjoy it with him, like in the old days. Brian sat at the stern and ate his lunch, as he always did.
 
It was evening and quickly approaching night when Brian was finally finished with his rounds. He made one final notation in his log and went to make his report to the Captain. Brian headed to the mess to see if he might find the Captain sitting down for dinner. But when he got there it was completely empty, not a soul in sight. So Brian made his way to the Captain's quarters, the Captain needed to hear his report, but the Captain's quarters were completely empty. After another futile search, Brian gave up, he went to his own quarters and lay down to go to sleep. As he always did.
 
Three different fisherman had called in reports within an hour. The Coast Guard arrived and began a search but this wasn't the first time and they didn't expect to find anything. Reports had been coming in for years of people seeing The Colchester drifting by with a man standing at the bow. They searched for two hours, by sea and air, they never found a thing.
 
Brian awoke to a crisp and clear day. He pulled on his boots, checked himself in the mirror and grabbed his log. Brian headed out to the port bow and started slowly making his way forward. Inspecting the cargo and the rigging as he went, as he always did.",shortscarystories
"I like having my bed beneath my window. No curtains or anything, just the window. 

I can sleep to the sound of raindrops, wake up with the sunlight and also easily jump out of my room to get to the balcony without opening the door. In some occasions, I leave it open so the wind enters my bedroom, but when is too cold, I just slide it down and get underneath my blankets. 

Streaky, my cat, usually follows me and we spend the evenings sitting on the balcony and watching the big tree in front of my house. Sometimes he likes to sleep outside, and scratch the window for me to let him in. Then he can jump right onto my bed and cuddle, so he’s all comfy and happy. I love being with him.   
Loud scratches woke me up tonight but then they stopped. I was about to turn back to let Streaky enter, but oh— there he is. Right on my feet, the light from the moonlight is enough for me to figure out his silhouette. He must have managed to come inside. He sure looks fat, I really need to get him to exercise. I just closed my eyes.

Streaky came near my chest and laid there. I got to admit that his claws were hurting me a little bit and that his fur was rough, but I’m not a bad owner or anything. He just needs a little trip to the pet salon. I usually don’t let him sleep on top of me, but I was so sleepy I didn’t care. He licked my face and it surprised me the smoothness of it. I just giggled and kept on sleeping, Streaky was grateful. 

I woke up without Streaky on my bed, but I decided to look for him after I was ready for school so I could give him a kiss goodbye. 

Is that Streaky? Yikes, that window is really dirty.

I got my window cleaner and jumped out to the balcony to hug him. He was softer than the night before. 

“Silly cat, did mom already bathe you and let you go outside?”

I kissed Streaky’s forehead, to which he adorably purred, and got near the window to clean it. Oh— glass does make things look distorted, because my handprint doesn’t even look that humanlike. 

There’s always something new to discover.

I love having my bed beneath my window.",shortscarystories
"Do you ever feel like someone is watching you? Because I do. All. The. Time. It’s quite annoying actually. I wake up—I feel watched, I leave and get in my car— I feel watched, I go to work— I feel watched, I come home— I feel watched. There’s not a second of the day I don’t feel watched. 

In the back of my mind, I always wonder if it’s just my paranoia or if someone is actually stalking me. It’s been three weeks now and I don’t feel safe. I’ve bought two deadbolts and installed them along with my regular locks. I still don’t feel safe. 

Sometimes I black out, and that scares me. I’ll wake up in a different place than I originally was, in a different outfit, with no recollection of what happened. The hours would fly by with no acknowledgement. It would be 1pm and I’ll black out— wake up at 5pm. What happens in that blackened state? So much can happen within four hours. Isn’t that nerve wracking? Not knowing what you’re doing for four hours, and then just waking up feeling a bit disoriented. 

Well today, I blacked out for a few hours. I woke up at my desk, with a note sitting in front of me— my hand grasping the pen. The note read, *I know you see me. I’m watching you, always.* Why would I write that? I’M the one being watched— or at least I think I am. Maybe it’s just my subconscious letting out my paranoia. 

The next day, the note disappeared. I don’t know where it went. 

******
It’s been three days and I still feel intense eyes on me everywhere I go. I blacked out again today, and when I came to, I was on a street that felt strangely familiar. I was apparently hiding behind a bush that was right below a window. It was nighttime, maybe 10pm? I looked up. The note that went missing was taped against the window. Whose house was this? Why did it feel faintly familiar? 

That’s when I started to realize that maybe I’m *not* the person being watched, but the person *watching* people. Is this where I go when I black out? Have I taken things any further— have I hurt anyone? The paranoia I’ve been experiencing has just been my blackened out memories. It hit me. I don’t have a stalker— *I am* a stalker.",shortscarystories
"A loud **BANG** resonated through the ship as the UNS *Voyager* appeared 10 light seconds away from the Sirius station. Captain Smith rubbed his freshly-bruised chest. The jump had been near the limit of the *Voyager*'s range, and when you start pushing it that much, the universe pushes back.

They had been forced to make such a taxing jump because the Sirius station stopped responding to comms a day earlier, and the commanders of the UN navy were concerned. They had every reason to be; the war was stuck in a stalemate and Sirius was next door to Earth herself.

So the *Voyager*, the closest ship to the system was sent in to investigate. She had an excellent array of communications gear. So her crew was tasked with jumping in, reporting any Diermi ships, and hopefully jumping away before she was boarded or destroyed.

Twenty seconds had passed since the *Voyager* had jumped in her sensors could see most of the space around the station. No other ships. The station still did not respond to any messages. Captain Smith relayed this to UNCC.

They instructed him to dock with the station and send a team on board to see what was happening. He selected Sergeant Chen's squad, seeing as how her troops were the only infantry on board.

Sgt Chen entered the station with the six other members of her squad. As soon as they passed through the station airlock, they smelled the rot. Pvt Tubb, the radio man, tried to contact the bridge, but there was no response. Chen decided her unit would keep going into the station to figure out what was going on.

Captain Smith was concerned when Chen's squad did not check in, but he trusted her. Besides, what could he do? He couldn't spare any other crew. No, he knew Chen would be back with news of what happened to the station crew.

After two hours of anxious waiting the airlock alarm chirped, signaling the return of the away team. However, when Smith pulled up the security camera on his display he only saw one soldier, Chen, frantically working the controls to close off the ship from the station.

Smith had her immediately brought to the bridge for a debriefing. Distraught at the loss of her team, her voice shook as she described how her squad moved through the perfectly clean and deserted station. Once they were deep into the station, doors and hatches would close randomly, splitting men off from the rest of the squad. They would open seconds later, and that man would be gone, disappeared without a trace. She retreated with her steadily vanishing squad.

She and she alone managed to get back to the *Voyager*. Captain Smith sent Chen down to the medical bay for a full exam and started the ship on a course for Earth. The medical staff gave Chen a clean bill of health as they jumped away from the gore-filled station. The thing wearing her body smiled.",shortscarystories
"   If you find yourself out at night, in a dark alleyway or a deserted stretch of street for instance, you would do well to be careful. Simply keep your eyes forward and pray someone up there likes you. After all, who knows what you'll see if your vision strays. Maybe you'll catch a glimpse of something just within your peripheral vision. You could just brush it off, figuring it was just a cat or maybe your imagination, there's always an explanation after all... Isn't there?

&amp;#x200B;

   You'll think that until you see it again, this time clearer than before. You'll see the long dark coat, blowing outwards, almost one with the shadows around you. Their eyewear will cast an eerie green glare in what little light there is, and their face, hidden behind a cheap paint respirator mask, hair tucked away under their hood. You will realize you were not seeing things in that moment. From here, there are two ways this night can end. You  could simply continue your journey, no hassle, no further incident. You'll simply sleep this event off and continue your meager existence until other forces catch up to you.

&amp;#x200B;

   Maybe you won't be so lucky though. Maybe this figure will overtake you, faster than one person could, and within moments, all you will see is a frenzied blur of green and darkness. Your body will be found by sunrise, perhaps by some partiers leaving their hedonistic  pleasures behind, maybe by some barfly recently evicted from his favorite barstool. Possibly some students heading into class? Who knows. You'll be beaten and battered, covered in wounds, more wounds than one person could possibly inflict. There will be so many shapes and sizes, so many different imprints on your body, how the coroner will have their work cut out for themselves. There will be no DNA, no fingerprints, no witnesses. Your case will eventually go cold, as many have before you.

&amp;#x200B;

   And many more will afterwards. No city is off limits, no state is out of reach from these unfortunate events. Anyone could really be behind these acts really, those kids you see on the streets after school, your best friends, your roomate, that cashier at the supermarket. Nobody can be too sure these days.

"
I am completely fine. Do not talk to me about getting help. Do not remind me of what I did. I just need to confess.

It was a normal Wednesday afternoon when me and my wife were having a meal that I prepped.

We sat down and my wife complimented my cooking. I thanked her. After a while, I start to notice - why is she on her phone so much right now? What is something more interesting happening right now? Does she not want to talk to me?

She kept placing her phone down so I couldn’t read the notifications; that sneaky bitch. Does she really think i’m that dumb? I slowly started talking to her about her phone. Asking questions as to why she is on it a lot. She tried dismissing it but I kept bickering. I reached for the phone but she quickly snatched it away. I stood up quickly which caused the table to shake - she looked at me and called me controlling. I’m not controlling. I. am. not. controlling.

I whipped around and picked up a steak knife, and waved it in her face.

“Why are you cheating on me? What did I do? WHAT DID I-“

Before I finished my sentence, anger got ahold of me and I plunged the knife deep into her chest. The tears in her eyes spilled and she collapsed to the floor. Laughs ripped out of my throat as I also started to sob. In between crys, I would giggle. Why? Why did I do it? I am not controlling her. She was overreacting. The whole relationship was full of her calling me controlling. But i’m not.

After I had calmed down, I picked up her phone to see who the fucker was that tried to talk to my wife. I’ll kill him. 

DING! Another message. 

I stared in shock as I read ;

“Hey, you there? He’s surprise is going to be soon and I want to try plan it as fast as possible. If you can call later that’d be great, thanks!”

My mouth was wide open. My eyes still full of tears. Did I just murder my wife because of this? No. NO. This was her fault for not telling me. I am not controlling her. I wasn’t controlling her. It is her fault. I told her so many times not to talk to guys without my permission. She made it suspicious. It’s her fault. I hate her. I am not fucking controlling. 

Her body is rotting, it’s been three days. I haven’t left but I have been pretending to be my wife while texting. My surprise birthday party is taking place here, and it’s happening tomorrow. What do I tell them? I know. They will understand. I was not controlling her.

"Today is a Bad Day. It all started this morning. When I woke up, I was tired and my chest hurt. I told this to my wife, who was laying next to me, already awake. She called me tired and grumpy. She then got up to make breakfast. I stayed in bed, too pained to get up. “Toast or cereal?” my wife called from the kitchen. “Cereal,” I yelled back. I fell back asleep to the sound of her setting the table. 
When I wake up, my chest is hurting much more than it was before. And Fuck my wife. “I asked for cereal!” I yell. “Why’d you make toast?” “I didn’t, silly,” she quietly responds. “Now come down and eat.” She can’t fool me.

" 

The recorded apology of waiting on hold cycles over the tinny background music. Then it stops. Like falling asleep to the rain, only to be pulled awake after the storm passes.   “Hello.” A deep voice answered. Chocolatey and patient. Expecting another overly enthusiastic cog in the machine of customer service, I pull the phone back looking into the screen. Making sure I called the right number. “Is this, uhh, customer service?”

“Absolutely.” The voice repeated. 

“Okay good. I’m calling about a lost debit card. My name is-”

“Absolutely.” The monotone voice interrupted. I wait, did he have more to say? 

“Do you need my name?” Silence seeped through the other end of the line. “Is there someone there? Or is this still the automated thing, the machine?”

“Absolutely.” I wait a moment or so, waiting to hear a breath or a cough. Maybe I can wait out the patience of whoever is on the other end of the line. Still nothing. Apparently I have a shorter wick than I thought, I just need this taken care of.  “Alright is there somebody there so can I get some help with my card?”

“Absolutely.” 

“Meaning you can help me or that there is a real person on the other end?”

“Both.” The voice cut back almost immediately, the sultry voice giving way to frustration. 

“Thank god. Alright, so… I need help with locking my debit card.”

“Fantastic.” Changing it up I see. 3 words down, only a few million to try out. 

“Do you need my number or something?”

“Absolutely.” Scratch what I said. I spin for a moment in my chair, waiting for something other than a word or two. Was that a breath?

“Yes.” Answers the voice. I stop spinning. Something, electric? Like licking a nine-volt. Hard to describe yet immediately recognizable. My stomach turns for a moment.  Dropping as if I was caught doing, something. Or when base is only a few yards away from my hiding spot, but my shoe pushes gravel out from under me. And the back that was facing me whips around, eyes gleaming at his soon to be- 

“Prey.” The deep voice picks the word straight out of my head like a ripe peach. The branch bounces back. Leaves fall, cloaking the black hand that holds me. “Who is this?” A small quiver shakes the words. 

Nothing.  Sitting still as the dead. That feeling returns. I remember nights running from my father. He stumbles through the house, a handle of whiskey and a white-knuckled fist wrapped around his- 

“Worn.” The voice stabs into a repressed memory. Gripping me. Pushing me back into my seat. 

“Belt.” Before the held breath escapes I hang up the phone and slap it onto the table. Standing and stepping back, I nearly slam my shoulders against the wall opposite my desk. A drenching cold sweat, short breaths, and gooseflesh covering my body. Tingling up and back. A relay of nerves.

The phone rings.",shortscarystories
"So he fucking won. I don't know why it bothered me so much but it did. Greg and his smug ass face is the the guy you love to hate. He's the guy where everything comes easy. The high school quarterback type that marries the gorgeous cheerleader. He's the spoiled asshole who drove the BMW to school the day after his sixteen birthday. The guy who started at this job after you but moved up the ladder way quicker. Not because he is an ass kisser, he does a good job, but better than me? No way. He has two adorable kids who are ""allowed to make their own decisions"" and are considerably well behaved, those little fucks. He has the nicest clothes and has the fullest head of hair. You know the Greg I'm talking about.

Well, he fucking won. I know it isn't a big deal, but he fucking won the company holiday party raffle. I mean seriously who cares about a 50"" Samsung flatscreen TV? I can buy my own. It isn't about that though. It’s about him winning all the fucking time. What about me? Why not me? I’m not saying the raffle was fixed, don't get me wrong, I'm just saying it was probable he would win. Of course he won. He has won at everything in life.

And there I was. The guy who didn't make the football team. The guy who never really had a great relationship with anyone other than Janice, whom I've chatted with online for the past year and have never technically really met as of yet. The guy who went to school on his 17th birthday with a shithole hand me down, 1974 baby blue truck that had four cylinders but only three of them actually worked. The guy with the thinning hair and the wrinkled Old Navy polo shirt, that has sat at the same desk every day for the past 6 years next to the coffee maker, and by default it has become my job to make sure ""we got a hot pot of Joe on, buddy"" at all times.

In other words, the guy who lost the fucking company holiday party raffle. Yeah, that’s me. The guy who has always lost the company holiday party raffle. I sat there with the losing ticket, just staring at it. Only four numbers away. Four damn numbers. The sweat still marked where my nervous thumb permeated the raffle ticket; number 6617. I just sat there in the dark, on the couch in his living room, a mere 30 feet from his freshly bludgeoned body. His face frozen in shock.

"You could hear a pin drop. Tranquil, peaceful, amicable, the setting was almost serene. Golden rays of sunlight flitted through the warehouse windows, perched high near the ceiling, giving the entire room a golden glow. Reflecting on the floor which was messy and littered - puddles of water lay in random spots and scraps of paper flew all over. The light also showed off the walls, covered in colorful graffiti and torn down posters. With the exception of a solitary figure bound to a chair in the middle, the warehouse was deserted. However, despite its destitute nature, the warehouse looked almost artistic - beautiful even. 

The situation in reality couldn’t be further from the truth. Hannah’s eyes flicked open and she surveyed the scene infront of her, confused. She couldn’t remember where she’d been or how she’d gotten here, bound tightly to a chair in the middle of an abandoned warehouse. 

The bitter taste of the gag in her mouth was making her choke. She tried to spit it out to no avail. A scream attempted to escape from her throat only to be held back. 

Tears slowly rolled down her cheeks. Who would do this to her? How long had she been there? What day was it? Her memories struggled to find their way to the fore. Everything was foggy.

“My name is Hannah, I’m 25,” she thought to herself.” 

If she managed to remember the small things, she would probably manage to remember what happened. 

“I just started working, I love my family, I hate sports...” 

She cut off and tried to scream in frustration. There was a blank space in her brain and try as she might, she was unable to break through. 

A headache was beginning to creep up on her and the gag was making her attempt to throw up. 

She was going to die. 

The headache seemed to bring flashes of what had happened. It was the weekend. She was at a bar. It had been a long week and she had to unwind. 

How much had she drunk? Sniffing the white lines of powder. Her entire body froze. How much had she unwound? Had that been cocaine? What the fuck had happened? 

She was pretty sure it was Monday now. And judging by the light it was probably just the late afternoon. 

Closing her eyes, she took a deep breath. The remaining memories were inaccessible. 

Calming her racing heart down, she slowly opened her eyes and saw the other woman.

Walking towards her, heels echoing on the ground. 

Panic ran through her every nerve.

"
My grandfather lived a quiet life after his wife passed away, choosing to spend his twilight years in solitude. He seemed to have no interest in being closer with his kids, or in getting to know any of his grandchildren.

He rarely attended any family gatherings. I only met him once, during a wedding. Like me, he was quiet, a wallflower in an otherwise loud family.

I wonder if that's why he sent me the letter.

He wanted me to help him get his affairs in order. As unexpected as the request was, I'll admit, I was curious.

I took a few days off work and made the drive up to his lake house, a lonely place at the end of a long dirt road.

The yard was an overgrown mess. The home, surely once a beautiful sight, was left in disrepair. As I approached the front door, I saw two worrying details. First, a note had been hammered into the door, and second, the door was ajar.

The note was in my grandfather's writing:

_Don't be alarmed by what you find inside._

_There are two messes for you to clean up. The first is here, in the entryway. The second is in the basement._

_The basement needs to be completely cleared out, the contents destroyed and the room cleaned._

_When it's done, the house and everything inside will belong to you._

Driven again by curiosity, I pushed the door open. The large entryway was dark, but I could see the swinging figure amongst the shadows.

I couldn't will myself to look up, so instead I looked forward. I didn't know why kind of game my grandfather had been playing, but I knew that I wanted it to end soon.

I found the door to the basement, also left open, at the far end of the room. I turned my phone's light on and, more cautiously this time, walked down the stairs.

The basement was small, and notably well-kept. On the wall to my right, a variety of tools hung from a wooden pegboard. To the left, power tools were neatly organized on a large table.

On the far side of the room, hand and leg cuffs were chained to the wall. Above them, hanging from the ceiling, were hundreds of locks of human hair, loosely organized by color. Handfuls of it were stapled to the ceiling, and for the life of me, I couldn't tell you how many people they'd come from.

Disgusted, I made my way back up the stairs. I decided that I would call the police and show them what I'd found, and after that, I would want no part in my grandfather's game. Some other poor soul would have to clean his mess.

When I looked up at him, on my way to the front door, I pointed my phone's light up so I could get a closer look at the monster who'd brought me here.

The man hanging from the ceiling wasn't my grandfather.",shortscarystories
"Glowing beneath dark and cold waters. 

Swimming calmly with no plan. Beautiful and simple. Hard to believe the apocalypse started with these brainless immortal beings. 

They washed up on the shores one day. Every beach and coast. All dead. And anything that touched them changed.  Eyes blanked, backs straightened, and they looked to the churning waters with fearful tears in their eyes. They journeyed down to the waves and walked into the water.

Few came back. Ones that did were crazy, seemed crazy. They spoke of a forgotten god beneath the sea, and his gathering army of tentacled creatures. The so called messiah's were shut away and drugged into submission, never to recover. Soon the news grew tired of the jellyfish, and went back to their normal program, and things were normal again.

But the Great One lumbered restlessly with his children in the cold ocean waters, feeding off of the people whom walked towards his lair. Strengthening after his long sleep.

He rose as the world slept. Those who looked upon him died, and those near the shores died of the storms. The world was lost to us before we even knew it. The King took back his world and spared us no mercy.

Cities burned and governments fell. Soon every country worked against him to no avail, as he ripped our world down.

And one day he stopped and walked back to the sea. He slept again. The few of us that lived worked together to rebuild civilization. There was few of us left. That was a time longer than most remember, but I do. We have rebuilt the great reign of men.

"I was just about dressed as my phone screen lit up and a notification popped on. 

*Your taxi has arrived!*

I quickly clicked ‘ok’ on the notification and went downstairs to go to my taxi. I usually hate taking taxis due to safety issues. However, the meeting I had today was safer to get to in a taxi rather than my own car. 

I went downstairs and surely there it was- the taxi. I opened the door and went inside. The driver gave me a smile through the rear view mirror. He then started up the car and drove on.

About halfway through the trip, the Taxi driver suddenly took a left instead of a right. I quickly tensed up and asked him that he took a wrong turn. He looked at me again this time turning his head around and giving me a wide creepy smile.

“Sorry, I’ll get back on track,'' he said as he took yet another wrong turn.

My heart jumped to my mouth as I quickly tried to open the door. Of course it was child locked. 

I put my hand into my pocket and pulled out my razor sharp knife. I smiled maliciously at the driver who was now in a state of panic.

"In a split-second a thunderous distant bang transformed itself into pure agony emitting from my head.

Lying atop my blanket, that tightly hugged my body, I felt the pain from my broken nose radiating into every corner of my head.

Disoriented and confused with blurry vision I turned and looked around the room, as blood was running up into my eyes. My first coherent thought that I must have fallen out of bed, was immediately getting thrown out again as I saw my bed positioned right above me.

Staring in disbelief, I noticed the blood from the tip of my nose dripping upwards onto it. In this moment I realized that in fact it was I that was stuck to the ceiling.

As a child I was frequently plagued by extremely vivid nightmares. My mother would help me cope by explaining that I'd just have an imaginative mind and if I wouldn't give it an outlet during the day, it would simply work overtime at night - when I wouldn't be in full control anymore. Since then I’d always find my art as a great release. But a couple of weeks ago these nightmares started to happen again, no matter what I did.

Whilst lost in thought I noticed something small in the corner of my eyes, moving in the dark – an absurd image of a little girls face split in half by two distinctly opposing expressions. Both her eyes which were close to tears, portrayed sadness and panic, whereas her mouth formed an eerily broad smile that showed of her tiny teeth.

Before I could verbalize my confusion, I noticed more faces in close proximity to hers.

One with a huge scar down the middle rendering it unrecognizable, as well as an accumulation of wrinkles that slowly opened both of its dark sunken eyes to reveal the face of an elderly man.

All of them seemed to scream without any sounds leaving their mouths.

While they were moving around, I realized that they weren't just floating in the dark but were stuck to a black mass that was steadily growing in size revealing more and more faces along its lumpy body. An array of unnaturally twisted long boney legs carried it slowly towards me.

A gaping black hole on the front of the creature opened up and started pulling me towards it head first.

Being frozen in shock, with nothing to hold on to around me, only feeling the warm piss running up my back I fell and lost consciousness.

Back when I was figuring out the best way to do this, I scanned every comic book characters origin story, and found there was always one common ground: having their inhibitions destroyed. One character's story in particular caught my eye, but we'll discuss that later.

So I go out and find the richest places I can, and destroy the thing that always holds the kids back from achieving their true potential.

Usually though, the kids end up just having extreme breakdowns, mental disorders, and often commit suicide because of my actions. 

The next kid will be the one, I can feel it. I will make the next Batman",shortscarystories
"As soon as he crossed the threshold, taking a step outside, Terry heard his ears pop. It was a quick and painless sound, but it still caught him off guard. 

He winced. 

Then, the air around him tightened, shrinking his shirt collar. It began to squeeze. 

He sighed. He gasped for breath. 

His eyes darted, hoping that something else was amiss with the world. That whatever was happening was just a nightmare, a dream. Anything. No such luck. 

Terry tried to turn around, to slip inside, but his legs melted beneath him. He crumpled with a thick cracking sound. 

And the air tightened. 

And tightened. 

Tightened. 

As soon as she looked out her window, Stacey saw a man lying on his front porch. He wasn’t moving. 

She went to open the door.",shortscarystories
"Everyone's got a devil on their shoulders.

They just don't see them.

""Luce? Hey Lucy, Earth to Lulu!""

I snapped out of my stupor and blinked several times. Zoe is leaning against my desk, concerned.

""What's up with you? You seem off today."" She pushed herself up and turned around to face me fully. ""Well, not that you aren't drifty normally— But... what's up?""

I glanced at Miss Luna, who giggled and waved as I did. ""Nothing really,"" I said, finally. ""Just daydreaming. You know me.""

She rolled her eyes. ""Of course, I should've known."" Throwing her hands up in a playful manner she grabbed my arm and pulled me up.

""Com'on, school's off!"" She grinned, helping me pack my school bag as she did so, ""here, just let me—""

**""Don't touch my bag.""**

Zoe jerked back, and the hand slowly nearing my neck stopped

""Geez, sorry."" She put her hand up in defeat, ""why so defensive?""

""...just don't.""

The hand withdrew.

Zoe stared at me for several seconds, and shrugged. ""Suit yourself.""

I kneeled down and began packing my bag, glancing up I see Miss Luna looking over Zoe's shoulder at her phone with child-like curiosity.

""There they go again, huh."" She sighed.

""What happened?""

""'Full Moon Killer strikes again, Town plagued with terror'"" she read the headlines of the article out loud. ""They've killed twelve already, and people don't think they'll stop any time soon.""

I glanced out the window, ""tomorrow night's a full moon, right?""

""Yeah."" Zoe shivered, ""and just... It's crazy! What they do to the victims..."" Her face twisted with disgust and pain, ""it's just not human! They're just teenagers, like us! What are they even killing them?!""

""Don't know."" I mumbled, continuing to pack my bag slowly.

Zoe sighed, ""you're taking forever with that."" She smiled slightly, ""let's go to McDonald's after school, okay? I'll meet you at the gates!""

As she turned and jogged off, watching her silhouette I shifted to look at the little raven on her shoulder. It's growing. I felt her presence loom over me; cold, whispy hands grasp my shoulder and her face neared mine. Dripping wet hair slid along my back, leaving nothing behind as her other arm raised and pointed towards Zoe's retreating back, her hand on my shoulder sliding closer and closer to my neck and her claws slowly dug into where I know my vein is and I gulped.

""Thirteen.""",shortscarystories
"I walk up the steps and ring the doorbell.

*Man:* Who the hell are you?

*Me:* Oh... hey, Kenny said I could drop by.

*Man:* Kenny? Kenny *who?*

*Me:* Morris. Said you two go way back.

*Man:* Na, I don’t know him. Now get lost.

*Me:* He said you have some BW? 

*Man:* Hey, you some cop? 

*Me:* No, just a connoisseur.

*Man:* Fuck you, pig, I don’t mess with that shit.

He slams the door. Just as expected though. A ‘Kenny Morris’ did send me, but perhaps his name’s fake? No worries. Blue Wood is *extremely* difficult to come by. Damn near impossible. The name’s derived from what a guaranteed overdose permanently yields: blue skin and the entire body turns hard and rough like a tree. I’ve heard it gives an unprecedented high, and I’ve heard he deals it. Regardless of the likely permanent side effect, I must have it. I knock again.

*Man:* I thought I told you to—

*Me:* Look, I’m *not* a cop. (I pull out two grand in fifties from my coat). And I know what the court will give for selling it. 

He stared at me, I held out the cash.

*Me:* Tall guy, with a naked blonde riding a dolphin tattooed on his right hand, told me you were reliable. We ain’t tight, but I’ve been shopping from him for years. I wanted BW, he said he couldn’t get it, but knows a guy who can. 

*Man:* Yeah, Kenny’s his name...

*Me:* So are we negotiating?

*Man:* Hang right here. 

He goes inside. After several minutes he returns with a small bag and a grin.

*Man:* He said you’re cool. My apologies.

We trade cash and product.

*Me:* Don’t sweat it.

*Man:* Yo, man. Take it *easy.*

I open my basement door and turn on the light, then descend the steps.

In the shadows, eyes withdrawal to the shadowy corner and a chain rattles.

“Izzy!” I joyfully say.

“Wha... who’s th... there?” 

“Isabel, you’re finally free to leave, darling.”

She crawls forward past her food bowl, wide eyed. “*Really?*”

I nod and pull out a key from my pocket, then draw near. She trembles.

“But under *one* condition, okay?”

“What is it, sir?” She sits on her knees.

“I want you to chew on this little tree branch, okay?” 

She joyfully receives her ‘ticket’ out and munches away. I admire her. My sweet little catch.

After a minute her hands freeze in the air, her neck tilts, and her skin rapidly turns blue. I proceed to unlock her, surprised at how fast the side effects kick in.

I kiss her forehead, her skin is hard and she doesn’t blink. I then ask, “What? You’d rather stay here with *me?*” I lock her back up. “Who knows, maybe I’ll plant you in a pot of soil? You’re not going anywhere.”

I rub her blue bark like skin and go back upstairs, turning the basement light off.",shortscarystories
"Meander from doorway to doorway, trying the knobs.   


Feel the click of the copper against your palm.

Copper can cleanse. 

Test the handles, click the locks. 

Let the curtains sway, sway with them. Part the cloth, press your face to the glass. 

Leave an impression. Write a note on the condensation. 

Listen to the rain rush through the gutters, make your way down the hall. 

&amp;#x200B;

Trace the table as you go, stir up dust. 

Leave an impression.

&amp;#x200B;

Sit on the couch, in its hard, slick liner. Hear the crunch of the plastic. 

Watch the rain through the reflection on the TV screen. 

Turn the heavy knobs, wait for the hiss of the power switch. 

It won't come. If it did, you'd be too old to hear it.

Leave the power on when you leave.  

&amp;#x200B;

Flicker in the doorway as you stand to go. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This part is harder.  

&amp;#x200B;

Make your way to the basement door, undo the latch. 

Turn the handle; cool, pure copper. 

Descend: there's no one to lock the door now. 

No secret hand to click the latch, to seal you below. 

No Father yelling and pounding on the wood. 

No splintered gateway to freedom.

Anymore.

Look down the steep well. Stare into it, the way you never would or could. 

Flicker in the gloom like a candle. Take a step. 

Anticipate the thump of the old, soggy stairs, never acclimatize to it. 

The sound is a drum underwater. Hands in a coffin. 

Fifteen steps to the bottom, straight down.

Barely a staircase, nearly a ladder.

Nothing at the bottom. 

Feel the rough old steps, their strange, corded texture. 

Heels to the back of each one, lest you fall.  

Step down to the second stair. 

Shut the door, disappear completely. 

&amp;#x200B;

Wait for the flicker of footfall under the grey crack of the door. 

For the turning of a latch and deadbolt.

For the TV. For the plastic crunch of the couch. 

Wait, maybe, for a sound from below. 

&amp;#x200B;

Breathe in silence, be the only sound. 

&amp;#x200B;

Walk backwards, take the steps one at a time. 

Go slow, don't look back. 

Watch the grey crack under the door as it slides up, out of view. 

Go slow, and don't look back. 

Focus on the sound of your own footfalls, your breathing. 

Three more steps. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two. 

&amp;#x200B;

The light from the door is gone.

&amp;#x200B;

Take the final step, backwards, feel the cool of the floor. 

&amp;#x200B;

Wait, maybe, for a hand on your shoulder. 

For panicked footfalls from the stairwell. 

For a breath that's not your own. 

For your own nerve to give. 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't let it.

In the basement of that old house, under its musty broken stairs, below the grey and the gloom, stand perfectly still. Breathe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Wait for the way to open. 

&amp;#x200B;

Wait. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, carefully, take another step down. Backwards. Below.

Sink into its bones. Be a thing new and old.

"On Monday someone locked her up in a room without food causing her to die from starvation.

She felt her stomach desperately trying to consume something for energy to the point it began consuming her own body fat.

On Tuesday her house caught fire, she tried running for the door but it disappeared in front of her eyes.

The fire licked away at her flesh as she was unable to run while the fire and smoke made breathing even harder.

As her own flesh began to cook she felt every second of her torture.

On Wednesday she was bitten to death by insects, they came swarming in from the window and kept eating her till the bone.

She felt all the tiny claws bit into her flesh as she tried to scream, making her lungs only fill with more crawling insects.

On Thursday she froze to death, she was locked out of her house the moment a blizzard hit her area. She was unable to move after only 1 minute, she felt all of her organs fail while she fell to the cold ground underneath her.

And today, as she woke up, she prepared for another horrible death.

No matter how many times she died, she kept waking up in that bed, unable to scream or cry.

She remembered every time she died vividly, the bites, the starvation and the cold.

As she went on with her day she couldn’t help but stare up at the sky.

In the sky there was something written in mirror image.

The meaning behind the words in the sky was lost to her but she hated them.

Somehow she knew her suffering was connected to the words written in the sky.

As she remembered all her previous deaths she read the words out loud: “The Sims 4”",shortscarystories
"Nature is beauty, or so I believe, which is why I am so disgusted as the hubris of man destroyed it, and continues to burn the passions of life.The worst part is the trees. To cut a tree is to destroy history, as they are the standing monoliths that witness all. Some people believe trees are sentient, I believe that they watch.


I thought back to my numerous trips to the woods where I lay. I knew them like the back of my hands. When I brought the woman I loved here, the trees watched. Just as they did when she left and I threw myself to the cause of protecting nature wherever it stood. Different trees watched as I stood on the pavement with my megaphone, begging the people to stop, and help fix their wrongs.


The trees watched when I went back to the clearing sobbed because of my failure. And the trees watched when I caught an illegal logger. When I cut him down like he cut them down I knew. I knew that they championed me. It didn't matter that the doctors said I delusional, that I needed help. The trees championed me.


So the trees watched as I took out the ignorant ones, tore daughters, sons and lovers who would've eaten the earth, burned the trees. You have to understand the trees were watching. I was their champion. The detective understood when I was chopping him up. His corpse said so. 


When I went to my trees this time though, something felt wrong. They had revoked their support of me. Reclaimed my worthiness. I raged and cried until I came to the clearing where I first took my fiance, and walked to the tree she hung herself in, ready to tear it down. Only to fall on a root that was never there before. It's in my chest now. I can see the irony; with all that they saw, that they ended me. My body is behind me now. I died, and the trees watched.",shortscarystories
"“Wake up,"" that same, angelic voice would whisper to me every night.  It was the sound of a female voice.  I don't know exactly when it started, but I only began to become aware of it recently.  Her voice never awoke any fear in me in the beginning, and I know I was the only one who would hear it.  My husband never even stirred when she spoke to me.
She would never tell me her name, and we would mostly talk about me; she would ask me questions like whether I was happy with my life, and when I would tell her yes, she seemed happy for me.  She would ask me if I was content in my marriage and my job, and I would tell her yes.  Again, she seemed happy for me.Then things started to change.
Suddenly, some nights, she would come to me as a man.  Confused, I would ask her...or him...how this was possible.  The reply would always be ""Is any of this possible in the first place?""  Knowing the simple answer was probably no, I decided not to question it anymore.  That was my biggest mistake.  That was when I should have known there was nothing angelic about this being at all.
My life began to unravel; I was no longer happy in my marriage, my job, or content with my life.  That is when this thing would begin to whisper sinister things to me, suggesting that I join him or her.  When I would ask what that meant, it would tell me to use my brain and put it together.  It was no longer friendly.
Now when this thing visited me at night, it invoked pure terror in me.  Although I wanted to leave my husband, I was too scared to be visited by this thing alone at night.  So I stayed with him.  Through all of his infidelity and beatings, I stayed.  It was as if this thing was laughing in my face, knowing my fear kept me with this man I had long since stopped loving.
The final day of my life, I decided I was too tired.  Too tired of life, of fighting with this inhuman thing.  Too tired to take another beating or suffer the humiliation of another woman telling me about my husband.  Too tired.
That was when I finally gave in.  Once again, it came to me in a male form and asked me if I was ready to join the other side.  I said yes.  There was no pain as I sliced my wrists, which I thought was strange, only the sight of red spilling from my veins.
My body gave out and suddenly I was looking at my lifeless self from above my body.  I saw the true look of this thing that had once been my friend and then became my worst enemy.  It was horrifying.  I knew I was not going to any place good.
Then I thought to myself had life really been that bad?  Were there not solutions to every one of my problems? I had once been so carefree and happy.  Sure a lot of people suffer unfaithful mates, and are beaten by lovers, but are there no other solutions than death? Of course there are.  I realized too late that there were so many other options.  I should have found my own happiness and maybe this thing would have left me alone.  There was always a way out and taking my life was not the answer.  I realized too late.",shortscarystories

This is me, how she took all of the beautiful out of me,  and casted me in this role.

I want to drown her in the river. Make her pay for everything she's done to me. 

She can't drown because she is a worm, always able to make her way to the surface. Screaming and pouting because she is cold and wants inside of me.",shortscarystories
"Have you ever woken up with a heavy feeling weighing over you? Like someone is watching but no one is there, or something terrible is about to happen. Maybe it’s both. I woke up Monday morning feeling this way. I pushed myself to get ready for work even though I was already 20 minutes late and all I wanted to do was crawl back into bed. I dealt with depression and anxiety my whole life and I figured I was about to go down a dark hole for a while. Every day I woke up and noticed this feeling getting worse and worse. I felt my self being drained of the life I had thought I had. I kept reminding myself that every day is a new day, I will be okay. Little did I know I wasn’t even close to okay, or safe for that matter. I began to notice that I was sore when I would wake up. I noticed I was bruised in odd places. I could never remember bumping into things. Last night, I woke up in the middle of the night. I felt like I couldn’t move, and everything hurt. That’s when I noticed something, or someone was next to me. I tried screaming, god did I try screaming but nothing came out. I felt the tears running down my face. I sat their hopeless, scared, and in pain. Just when I thought I was going to slip away and give in, it all stopped. I was able to move and sat up quickly. There in the corner of my room was a shadow before it disappeared it said, “I will be back when you are back to normal; you taste the best when you are not drained of your essence.” So here I am, ending my life. I know my friends and family will think that I did this because of my mental troubles. I know now that I must cut off this thing’s food supply, myself. I know this thing whatever it is will be back. I cannot live knowing this. I am sorry….",shortscarystories
"On April 15th, the Robertsons died in a car accident. On September 19th, the Robertsons woke up.

To Melissa and her daughter Joyce, the news that they'd been killed in a flaming wreck of twisted metal after a head-to-head collision on the interstate came as quite a shock - the kind of thing that would perhaps cause a certain level of unpleasant psychological distress, if left unchecked.

Their husband and father - the famed geneticist, Dr. Ernest Robertson - was sure to ease them gently into it.

""I was able to reconstruct your memories almost exactly,"" he said. ""Save for the crash, of course. That's something you're probably better off forgetting, but otherwise you're good as new. Just leave it all to me.""

Dr. Robertson had done an impeccable job: reconstructing his wife and child exactly how he wanted to remember them, drawing full, living human beings out of the smallest strands of DNA. A lifetime achievement that redefined science as we knew it.

And things were perfect, for a while. Even though the two of them had no real, tangible awareness of the deaths they'd experienced, Joyce and Melissa found a new appreciation for the life Dr. Robertson had given them. They carried themselves with a keen awareness of the fact that everything they had, they owed to him. 

They were grateful. They were happy.

It was a terrible shame, then, when Melissa and Joyce began to disappoint Dr. Robertson. 

Sometimes, when Dr. Robertson told Joyce it was time to go to bed, she'd be petulant. Sometimes, when Dr. Robertson wanted some peace and quiet, she'd insist on making noise.

Melissa, too, would ask questions she shouldn't have been asking. About gaps in her memory, about tiny inconsistencies here and there that didn't seem to add up. She just kept tugging at the little threads on the edges of the perfect life Dr. Robertson had so generously stitched together for them.

It was when Melissa found a photograph of herself (before the crash, she assumed) where she had a face that seemed ever so slightly different - Fuller cheeks, darker eyes, a rounder chin - that the good doctor decided enough was enough.

Dr. Robertson thought Melissa and Joyce were being ungrateful, so one morning, he took a revolver out of his desk drawer and shot them both through the forehead while they slept. When the bodies stopped twitching, he dragged them out of bed, and threw them on the pile.

Shame, terrible shame, Dr. Robertson thought, as he made two notes in his journal: Less curious; more obedient.

""Tenth time's the charm,"" he said, as he got back to work.

On November 6th, the Robertsons died in a car accident, as far as they're aware. On January 3rd, the Robertsons woke up.",shortscarystories
"He laid on the bed, screaming.


I walked around the bed that was in the center of the room, smiling the entire time, and I didn't take my eyes off his for a second.


His screams were muffled by the large and dirty sock that I'd stuffed in to his mouth, then tightly taped down with strong duct tape. He was securely tied to all four posts...he wasn't going anywhere.


In between his screams, I believe he was trying to speak; *""Please?!""*, or, *""Why?!""*, perhaps.


I didn't reply though. This particular moment was to induce as much fear as possible. Come to think of it, it probably wasn't, ""why""...he knew why.


I continued to stroll around him, humming *our* tune, and his eyes popped wide open when he realised what it was.


At the end of the bed, there was a small table, with quite a diverse set of tools. 


I hovered my hand over a leather-belt...then a corkscrew...then a blowtorch...I stopped and wiggled my fingers, forever smiling and staring. I continued across the table...I hovered over the bucket of cement...he was muffling something into the sweaty sock.


""What?...What's that?"" I sarcastically asked, ""Oh I'm sorry, I simply can't hear you over the sound of *our song* in my head."" And I continued to hum the tune.


I waved my hand slowly back over the tools and stopped again at the blowtorch.


I held it over his naked body, the flame roaring, his body writhing...I hadn't even brought it to his skin yet.


I held it above his privates and stared directly in to his eyes.


It burned through his skin like I was finishing off a creme brulee; browning and bubbling the few top layers, before finally crisping to perfection.


His screams only lasted about ten-seconds, perhaps not even that, before he passed out from the pain.


I wanted him to experience the pain and suffering, but my adrenaline took over, and I just couldn't wait for him to regain consciousness.


I went back to the table. This time, I chose the belt, and I whipped every inch of his body that I could see. I replaced it for the corkscrew, which I rammed into one hand.


I picked up the bucket and poured a thin layer over his body, barring the neck and head. It was that fast-dry stuff, and boy did it dry fast!


He finally awoke sometime later and I made sure I was close-by. When his slow moans turned into histeric screams, I knew that he was fully awake.


I returned to the table for my final tool. I picked it up, cupped it in my hand and walked to his side.


I placed the laundry-peg on his nose, and let go, clamping his only airway.


""I'm going to put some music on..."" I told him. I hit play and started to slowly dance.


""It's *our* song...""


His body did one last jerk, and I smiled. 


After 482 days, I finally left my captors basement.",shortscarystories
"I learnt something about plants yesterday.

Plants can sometimes grow on you. 


I learnt something about the brain yesterday. 

When you complete a difficult task, your brain is rewarded with dopamine. Switch that difficult task with a basic human action, like anger, and swap out that dopamine with an extreme and unheard of highly addictive opioid. If you do that, you will become addicted to anger.

I learnt something about addiction yesterday.

 If you get a kick out of a drug, you will have to up your dosage in order to feel the same rush you did at first. Congratulations, you are now addicted to violence. 

I learnt something else about plants yesterday.

Plants can sometimes grow on you. Especially if you let them into an open wound. But who would let that happen on purpose, unless you are an absolute dumbass.

I learnt something about the Spouters yesterday. 

The news stations will report strange cases of plants sprouting inside of people’s stomachs. They call them Sprouters. There are no other symptoms other then all of the affected being noticeably angry. But you have a plant fucking growing your inside of you, so who wouldn’t be pissed off. 

I learnt something about my wiFe yesterday.

She won’t shut up. The bitch keeps on telling me to go to the hospital. Yelling at her felt felt so good.

I learnt something about my son yesterday.

The little brat got a bad grade, so I gave him some bruises. You can do better than a fucking 80%. Jesus Christ I felt powerful hitting him.

I learnt sOmething aboUt strangers yesterday.

The guy in front of me, yeah, guess what he did? GUESS! He fucking looked at me! So you want to know what I did!? I BIT HIS FUCKING EYES OUT!!! And it felt like heaven when I did it.

I LeANt SoMEThinG AbOut GarDeNInG TOdaY!!!!!!

If, if your stomach is feeling funny, FUCKING KILL SOMEONE!!! That will get the police and bystanders to come to you! And when they do, VOMIT DOWN THEIR THROATS!!! Your pain will be gone, and you will have started a brand new garden!!!  I FEELS SO FUCKING GOOD!!! You should really try it.

"Knocking on the window, a tiny faerie taps gently on the frost covered window. Chastity rushes over, as she does every night, and opens the window for her faerie friends. The cold wind blows inside of her bedroom, but she doesn't care as her friends are here to visit.

They come inside, two by two, in all different colors. Chastity runs over to her toy box, pulling out some toys to play with.

""Not tonight,"" the pink faerie states as a green one pulls the toy out of her hands. ""We are leaving,"" a yellow one says.

Chastity screams, ""No! Don't leave me!""

""Oh dear, we aren't leaving you, you're coming with us,"" a blue one pipes up. Chastity dries her tears on her nightgown and sniffles.

""Where are we going? It's cold out there.""

""Don't worry, where we are going it will be warm,"" the pink faerie whispers.

The faeries swarm Chastity, pulling her towards the window and out, carrying her into the deep, dark night, above the forest and into a secluded tree house.

After Chastity gets settled into the warm treehouse with her friends, she hears her parents screaming. ""What's wrong with mom and dad? Let's go get them and bring them here!"" 

""No my sweet, they must stay home and face their destiny,"" the yellow one squeaks.

""What destiny?"" Chastity questions as her face turns a dark red.

""You see, before you were born, your mommy and daddy had a very hard time having a baby. They prayed every night to be able to have a baby as beautiful and as sweet as you are. Until one day, they prayed to the wrong deity. The deity promised them a wonderful little girl, for a price. Your parents agreed and off they went with you bundled up in their arms,"" the green one sings.

""Your parents are so silly, they forgot all about their little deal. We found you outside playing in the forest, remember? We then became the best of friends! But while we were playing, we could hear voices, angry voices, voices discussing the many different ways to hurt you and your parents,"" the pink one cries.

""We had to do something! We couldn't let our very best friend get hurt, or worse! So we took you here, where you will be kept forever. You may never leave, but you will still be alive and will always be able to play with us!""

I lied when I told her that it was all fake.

""Do it""

It started in South America, but it was quickly spreading through Europe, Asia and the rest of the continent. Before we knew it, Mexico was gone, and the US military was defending the border, but they were running out of people. One less soldier for us meant one more for them.

I lied when I told her there was no way they could get in.

""Do it""

County by county, state by state, they ravaged it all. Internet, gone. Phone lines, gone. Communication, gone. We decided to stay at home and secure it as much as possible, since we didn't know where else to go.

I lied when I told her the door could hold.

""Do it, Jacob"" she whispered

""I can't. I can't "" I answered, crying as quietly as possible

""You said you would. You promised""

Now I hear them walking in our living room, going through our stuff. There must bee at least 30, and it sounds like some are making their way upstairs.

""Please"" she whispered again ""One for me, one for you. Then it'll all be over""

"McKenzie sneaked quietly down the stairs. The sound she heard must be Santa arriving with her presents. She stopped a few steps from the top and peeked through the banisters.

No Santa.

She frowned and looked over at the milk and cookies sitting on the living room table. Neither had been touched, meaning Santa had not come and gone while she slept. So what was the sound she heard?

She was about to go back upstairs when movement caught her eye.

The tree was moving—by itself.

She gasped, then covered her mouth, afraid it would hear her.

She watched the tree’s limbs slowly moving—like they were stretching. Then the branches reached out and began pulling off each ornament and carefully placing them on the floor. It even peeled away the silver tinsel she had put on it.

When all the ornaments had finally been removed and lay in a small pile on the living room carpet, she watched the tree twist the screws that held it secure in tree stand. The limbs then reached down to the floor and pushed. She heard a wet, popping sound as it slipped free of the tree stand.

A crackling sound followed, and she watched the trunk of the tree split and grow legs, then begin walking across the floor. Each step sounded like the creak of a rocking chair. McKenzie was frozen in place as the tree headed slowly towards the door, skittering like some giant spider.

When it finally passed in front of the stairs, the tree stopped. Several branches snaked out, shot up the stairs and grabbed McKenzie's arms and legs. She started to scream, but another branch wrapped itself around her head, covering her mouth with sticky, piercing needles. She was pulled down the stairs, bouncing on each step, her head smacking against the wall. Each time she tried to fight against the branches, the grip grew tighter.

She could only watch as the tree grabbed the doorknob, turned it and opened the door. The night air swept inside. The tree pulled her along as it stepped out into the night. McKenzie shivered as cold air assaulted her. But what really made her shake was all the other trees, from all the other houses in the neighborhood, dragging all the other kids out of their homes.

She was pulled across the yard, over the sidewalk, and into the street—which scraped against her back and tore at her pajamas, digging into her skin.

As she felt her warm blood against the cold asphalt, she looked up at the sky and saw a gigantic shape blotting out part of the stars. As she was dragged down the street, unable to scream, she couldn’t help but notice how the dark shape in the sky looked an awful lot like a giant Christmas tree. There were even twinkling lights.",shortscarystories
"I met her in a bookstore. She wore a pink top and a short skirt and when our eyes met, she looked down.

She looked again, smiled.

Her name was Donna. She was leafing through “Intercourse” by Andrea Dworkin. She was surprised when I told her I knew Dworkin. She studied gender theory and had never met a guy who knew about feminism.

She put the book down, smiled at me as if to ask, what now?

I fell in love with her right then.

We walked all over the campus together. It was sunny and warm. Donna had long, wavy hair and smooth, creamy skin; I was so happy. We walked and walked, held hands. After dark, I kissed her outside the university library. The air smelled of pinecones and amber. She said she didn’t normally kiss guys she just met, but she felt so comfortable with me. I said it was the same for me and ran my hand through her thick hair and over the soft skin of her arms.

For our second date I cooked boeuf bourguignon. Donna wore a red dress with matching high heels. She joked, laughed softly, like melodious birdsong. We drank wine.

Donna told me how impressed she was. I was different from the guys she normally dated, those meat-headed jocks with their puffed-up, fragile sense of masculinity. Unlike them, I understood objectification and the male gaze and intersectionality. Her eyes were saying: you understand me. You see the soul inside of me.

We moved to the couch. Her kisses were hungry and when I slipped my hand underneath her dress she trembled. Her breath was fast and her face flushed. Then, suddenly, she withdrew her tongue from my mouth and her body slackened.

I looked at her face. She was asleep, like an angel. The tranquilliser had made sure of that.

Gently I stroked her face. I was relieved she hadn’t suspected anything; I’m not a mean person. I don’t like seeing girls in pain.

Most of all, I wouldn’t want to damage her. The soft wavy hair. The creamy, unblemished skin. It deserved only the best. I had improved my technique a lot: I could now remove the skin with just a few incisions to the torso, legs and arms so it would stay largely intact. It was young and strong yet tender, just like Donna. I was very excited – what an amazing suit I would tailor out of it, what I would look like wearing it! And the hair would be the best wig ever, the crown jewel in my collection! I would be so pretty.

Before that, though, I had to take care of Donna. She too deserved to be treated well. She was a person, not a thing. She was more than just skin and hair. I wanted to cherish her, preserve her forever. I picked up the heavy down pillow from last time, put it over her head, pressed.",shortscarystories
"In southern Appalachia working in the coal mines is a way of life. I’ve been working in the mines for twenty years the same as my father before me and his father before him. I currently work in a deep mine, we go down 260 feet to one of the largest coal seams on earth. It sits right at the center of the Bancroft Mountain range.
 
I’ve heard stories my whole life of tommy knockers, ghosts and apparitions appearing in the mines. I’ve personally never encountered any of these or believed in them. But here recently things have been weird, I’m starting to change my mind about these paranormal things.
 
It all started about a month ago when the 2nd shift crew came out of the mine with reports of strange growling sounds. And Billy had found a necklace made out of what looked like teeth, he said he found it dangling from a cross support that the team had passed by just an hour before.
 
Then a couple days later two of the dump trucks had bloody little handprints all over them. The handprints were as small as a childs and each one only had three fingers. Tools and things from the worksite started disappearing only to be found a few days later deep inside the mine. A week after the hand prints were found, Billy came in and quit. He had been working with us for over ten years, Billy was a good guy. He said that the little bastards followed him home and were looking in his windows at night.
 
A week ago I had just finished my shift. I was just about to leave when I looked in my rearview mirror and I saw one of the little sons of bitches. It stood about three feet tall, its skin was a translucent pale grey color. It had a big head with large jet black eyes, and it had a huge mouth full of sharp little teeth. But no other facial features whatsoever. I stomped on the gas and got out of there as fast I could.
 
Now they’ve followed me home. My motion light has been kicking on about three or four times each night. When I look out the back window I can see the little fuckers walking around in the yard. A few days ago my dog, a big husky mix, got all worked up and took off into the woods. Two days later I found pieces of her scattered about the flower garden in the front yard. Today I woke up in complete darkness, I was lying prone on what felt like rock. I could hear the distant hum of machinery and it smelled like gravel or coal dust. I slowly realized that I was in the very bottom of the mine. As I looked up I found myself surrounded by large black eyes and hungry mouths full of sharp little teeth.",shortscarystories

"Break-ins aren't uncommon. I've worked at the park for ten years, and I can tell you for a fact that teens clipping through the chain-link and taking the aqualoop for a midnight joy-ride is a regular occurrence. 

Standard procedure is to clean up the mess and get on with it. It's hardly an ""end of days"" scenario. This latest incident, the trouble amounted to replacing a broken padlock on one of the perimeter gates, and scrubbing a couple muddy bootprints from the mouth of one of the tube slides feeding into the main pool.

Like I said, pretty standard procedure. We checked the security tapes - guy with a duffle bag entered, then left four hours later. We figured he was probably getting high and jerking off to National Inquirer clippings, or whatever it is meth-heads do in their downtime. 

In a park that serves around a thousand kids, daily, solving that mystery wasn't exactly our top priority.

Park opened up like normal. Nice Summer's day. I was standing next to the main pool - lifeguard duty, just making sure all the kiddies are safe. It's largely a dull, uneventful job, so when Raj, one of our ""security officers"", approached me and struck up a conversation, it was a welcome break in the monotony.

""Hey,"" he said, holding out something that glinted in the sun between his thumb and forefinger. ""Check this shit out. Found it on the grass near the gate. Health and safety hazard, don't you think?""

He was showing me a razor blade.

""Shit,"" I said, regarding the jagged edge with a cringe. ""Good catch, bud. Hate to see someone step on that.""

Raj nodded.

Then there was this terrible, echoing scream from inside the tube slide. 

I don't think I'll ever forget it, just that animal yelp of desperate fear and pain, as a kid - skin bright red, in a tide of bloody water - came tumbling out into the main pool. They were just fucking shrieking - I swear to god, it was the stuff of nightmares.

Still, didn't compare to what I was about to see.

Like I said, I was on lifeguard duty, so I jump in to save the kid. It's a little girl, about six, and when I get hold of her, I see her skin's opening up all over her body in these long, ragged gashes. She's shaking; writhing, in shock and pain, bleeding everywhere. Everyone in the pool is in hysterics.

As I'm carrying her over to the medical bay, my shirt and pants drenched in water and blood, I can't help but think about that tiny little razor blade Raj showed me, with its vicious little edge.

Lemme ask you a question: Do you have any idea how many of those things someone can superglue to the inside of a waterslide in four uninterrupted hours?

Cause now, I sure as hell do.",shortscarystories
"""I'm not surprised that you shot him.""

Shawn shone his flashlight to the body in the middle of a pool of blood.

""Although I hoped you'd have more restraint to yourself, I can understand that you joined the police corps just so that you can chase your parents killer.""

I contemplated in silence as the vivid images of the horror 12 years ago suddenly came back to life in my head.

""So there you have it. You have killed him,"" he spoke again while checking his watch. ""I have called the coroner team. We may have 10 minutes before they arrived. Let's check the scene.""

I moved forward and slowly approached the body in the dark with my gun still pointed out, while Shawn wore his gloves and checked out the nearest cabinet. The killer wore a navy jacket with black sporty pants, making him hard to see within this dark abandoned building in the middle of the night like this. But his mask is unmistakable. The police got a tip yesterday that a homicide happened in this block and random passenger saw someone wearing a mask with the exact description as the one who killed my parents. I opt to take the case and Shawn went with me as well.

""But it's a curious thing,"" he flipped over the files on the cabinet, ""from these documents, he looked like a normal scientist to me, not a homicidal maniac."" He put down those files back and closed the cabinet. ""And from your story, he looked like always able to get out from arrest no matter how the police cornered him?""

""Yes, that's what I read from the police reports,"" I threw Shawn a serious look, ""so that's why we can't lower our guard. Have you go through his desk?"" I shone my flashlight on the messy desk on the other side of the room.

""Yeah, on it,"" Shawn walked. I returned my sight on the body. ""Wait... the body is \*gone\*!"" I shouted.

""Wait, what?"" Shawn came to me. I shone my flashlight further and see a trail from the pool of blood stretched outside the other door of the room. I immediately ran toward the trail. ""Hey, wait!"" Shawn shouted behind me.

I followed the trail in the dark through a dark hallway. The trail turned behind a closed door.

I pointed my gun and slowly opened the door. It's dark. The room was quite messy, the air felt stagnant. The trail of blood suddenly stopped in the middle of the room.

Shawn showed up on the door with his flashlight. ""Did you found him?""

""No, not yet. He even took his mask,"" I replied.

""Oh, you mean this?"" Shawn reached up to his jacket and pulled out the mask, that dreaded mask.

""How did you..."" my sentence trailed off as Shawn's face changed and transformed... into my face.

""Good night, buddy,"" I heard my voice coming from his lips while he shot his gun into my chest.",shortscarystories
"  On that fateful day, I was walking down the street and came up upon my older siblings, Jack and Mary. They had recently moved into the neighborhood but were out of our parent’s house. We decided to head to the store, relatively bored and having nothing better to do. On our way, we met this creepy looking older woman. We hadn’t noticed anything out of the odd about her until she came closer. As she passed, we noticed just how deformed and creepy her face truly looked. Her left eye was looking straight ahead, while her right eye was looking wildly in every direction. 

Seeing this shocked us to our core, chilling our bones and raising goosebumps on our arms. This wasn’t truly that peculiar, though something seemed very off. Making an impulse decision, we followed her around town until she eventually reached her home and departed inside. My elder siblings trying to prove their courage both volunteered to investigate the inside, and I watched as they entered the run-down old shack of a house.

Jack and Mary still had yet to return after some passage of time. Taking it upon myself, I entered the creepy home as well. Upon walking through the door, my eyes met nothing but thin air and cobwebs. After exploring the abandoned abode, I saw a dim light come from the basement. Against my better judgment, I slowly crept down the stairs. What I saw on the cracked concrete floor will traumatize my very mind for the rest of my life.

I saw the same old woman as before, but this time it was different. This time, horror blazed up my spine, freezing me in my very spot. The old woman I had seen before was now morphed into an amalgamation of limbs, pinchers, and eyes. This creature was like no other, half-human, and half arachnid. I turned to flee the confining underbelly of the home, only to be grabbed around the waist. 

Long, sharp pinchers stabbed into my abdomen, pain searing into my skin. I screamed in agony, yet the beast did not release me. She stuck me down her horrid throat, swallowing me whole. Time passed of me sitting alone and scared in the stomach of the beast before I saw another sign of life. It was my beloved siblings, Jack and Mary! Jack began kicking at the inside of the beast while Mary hugged me tight to her wiry form. Soon after a long struggle, we heard a sickening rip and fell to the floor. The beast screeched behind us but faded away soon after, never to be heard from again. 

Everyone came out fine that day, and I even got to drink some hot cocoa while my siblings talked to the sheriff. What I saw that day will always haunt me, but I won’t let it affect me. I won’t give that beast what it wanted in the first place.",shortscarystories
"One night me and my coworkers decided to play with a ouija board out side of work. We talked to a girl named Quinn who said she was a demon. She seemed pretty cool till towards the end of taking to her we decided we needed to head home because it was like 2am but she wouldn't let us say goodbye until we promised that if we ever used the ouija board again that we would talk to her. About a week later the place where we worked caught on fire. So a few days after that we go to the lake and use the ouija board again and asked for Quinn. We asked if she started the fire and she told us that she did. Then it seemed like Quinn got scared or over powered because the board started acting up, spelled zozo and  started counting backwards. We quickly said goodbye and moved the planchette to goodbye. About 2 weeks later I was driving to my friends house. I should mention that the friend was a girl I was seeing at the time and she was cheating and using me. (I did not know this at the time)I guess Quinn knew because she seemed mad, protecting and jealous when me and my friends mentioned this girls name the first time we used the ouija board. So on the way to her house I hydroplaned and flipped my truck. I have to add the ouija board is in the truck. Some people driving down the road stopped to help get the door open and I climbed up and out. When the cops arrived they made sure I was ok and said they had to write me a ticket just because of the accident. I don't have the ticket anymore because this happened about 4 years ago but the address site of the accident was route 666 Virginia.",shortscarystories
"You know what I really envy celebrities. they seem to have it all. the adoration and the love .it must speak volumes for how popular you are when somebody who has never met you would literally get a tattoo of your face. those things are literally on you forever that is dedication right there. like I said I do envy them I mean who wouldn’t.
 I see their faces on the news on social media and even on posters. People wish them well every time they see them and if they don’t see them for a while they get worried and some even presume them dead. The trend is usually the same, they don’t see their friends often no more nor do they see their parents because the fame has separated them from the true people that care for them. 



The part that amazes me the most is when the fans get to see them in person, almost always the true fans are always reduced to tears. These are the fans that have been waiting for ages for a chance to meet them face to face and tell them how much they appreciate them.



 I can tell you it takes 10 years to make a celebrity. The first year they act erratic and still cling on to the hope they will get out. The second year is all about depression as their hopes slowly dwindle.by the third year they are completely broken, they can even ask for help because they know none is coming. That is when they get a camera and streaming equipment, they are so overjoyed they even manage to forget where they are. Ladies and Gentleman that is how you make a celebrity.



 I can see her she thinks she is safe in a group at night but she is mistaken. I give her three drinks at least until I can charm her and gain her trust. They will never identify me with this prosthetic mask I have on. With that pretty face and amazing figure, she will be a mega star but she has to pay the price first.",shortscarystories
"He looked over the chart and into the incubator. “Subject 413 Unviable.” he remarked to his assistant. It was such an innocent way of saying it, another cloning failed, another fetus to be terminated. Were they conscious at this stage, or even human anymore? Yes, it’s true that the act of cloning and genetic manipulation of humans was not legal or ethical, but they were curing diseases. They were saving lives! He would tell himself this over and over to ease the burden of guilt. He knew what “Unviable” meant, termination and incineration of the fetus; leave no evidence.

How long had he been working straight this time? He couldn’t recall, long enough that he was having trouble seeing again. He looked in the mirror trying to get his eye straightened, to bring it back parallel with the other. For as long as he could remember this would happen. As the day dragged on, his lazy eye would slide out of position until it was difficult to see, giving him a throbbing headache. He often wondered if this problem was the reason that he pushed so hard to improve humanity… 

No matter, a few hours of sleep and he would be fine. He never let it hold him back, this entire CRISPR genetic research company was his! Well… There was Jeff, his silent partner with silent being the operative word! While he labored day and night, Jeff was mostly away from the lab “networking.”. “It’s OK though; when the breakthrough comes, I’ll make sure I get the credit.” He thought. The breakthrough had to be close, the viability rate was improving with defect rates declining.

The defects could range from “visible insignificant” to “hidden extreme.” It was their biggest challenge, the biggest risk of being shut down. That’s why the Unviability Protocol was established and implemented. Earlier now, while they were fetuses, they were much easier to incinerate with less waste. He was close to a breakthrough he knew it.  He must make sure Jeff didn’t the credit for it. Jeff was always out doing something else, anything but work it seemed. He heard rumors that Jeff had everything, money, beautiful wife, extravagant vacations… All these things he was working to provide for Jeff. Yes, he would confront Jeff the next time he came in the office. For now, a nap to restore his vision, then back to work on the nearly perfect Subject 414. 

He saw Jeff’s silhouette slipping down the hall towards the office. Today was the day he would confront Jeff, either Jeff will start carrying his weight, or he would dissolve the partnership! He kicked the office door open and froze… There was Jeff staring back shocked… Had he never realized the similarities? They wore protective masks in the lab… Jeff looked like his twin brother, his almost perfect twin brother… His twin brother without the lazy eye…

Jeff slammed the intercom: “Security!! It’s Subject Nineteen… He’s become unviable!”",shortscarystories

"To exist is to suffer. It's a fundamental, indisputable premise of life. And there's no way out.

Suicide would work, but I can't work up the courage to do it. Knife, pills, toaster, it's scary, and all bring an intense moment, albeit brief, of suffering. And what if I survive? Vegetative or disabled, stuck in a rehab center, no, I can't commit suicide.

I've tried distracting myself with worldly pleasures, sex, money, entertainment, but there are always those moments when I am jolted back to a world of suffering. When I stub my toe or feel ashamed of something when I imagine my death or a hell of endless suffering.

So when *it* asked what I truly wanted, I responded honestly.

I want to be rid of the pain.

And it took it from me.

It's been a week.

I can't feel anything. There's a dull pressure when I contact something, but no pain. 

It was fine at first, I bumped into a few things, gave myself a few bruises I didn't even notice until later,

But now.....I'm desperate for any sensation, something vibrant and sharp rather than just this dull world that I can't experience.

My teeth don't hurt my tongue, I chewed right threw it, not even realizing I'd been wounded until hot, fresh blood flowed into my throat

My eyes don't hurt, I've blinded myself from the sun and squirted vinegar straight into my pupils. It damages my eyes, but they still can't feel.

My knife doesn't hurt my stomach, my hands, my scalp.

By now there are remnants of my attempts in every room of the house.

Teeth, hair, burnt flesh, skin, nails, blood, fingers...

I've damaged myself so much, I'm on the brink of death. At least this makes suicide a bit easier.

I want to feel again. I want the stimulation that comes with being alive, the suffering that comes with existence.

Because this...

This feeling is so much worse.",shortscarystories

When she claimed the throne there was no one who could stop her.

Thus she became the queen.

Despite this she was not a tyrant, nor was she benevolent.

"The cold wind felt beautifully icy across my body. The woods were as serene and placid as ever. A creek even babbled in the background. I loved the peace of these woods but to my trained eye the evidence of my prey was clear. I followed the trail silently, the prey had to be close, the prints were very fresh. I kept walking and enjoying the beauty of the hunt. The prints kept on getting newer and newer she couldn't be far now. I raised my bow. It was more elegant, a bow. The strength required for the bow. The simple beauty in a sharp stick taking life, propelled by your force. archery was more alive than a gun. Anyway a gun would scare the wildlife, and people. I am grateful to live in New York. Prey was incredibly easy to find. For deer, permits were handed out like halloween candy. for other animals, no one cares except the rangers who had to find my work. The overcast day made for a perfect ambiance for the mood of my hunt. Maybe my prey felt the same.


I'm close now. So close. A whole hour had passed as I was tracking her. This one is smart for her kind. She made false prints for me to follow. Then she and hid in brambles. She nearly escaped me, but her very breath betrayed her. I turned and let loose my arrow. I looked at her, such a beautiful specimen, even with my black arrow sticking out of her breast. Her hide would serve me well. Maybe I could make her a rug. But that was too obvious. A coat would just get me dirty looks. A curtain would work perfectly. I got to work skinning.


I left her in an obvious spot. The carrion birds would find her easy and nothing would go to waste. Unless a ranger came by. Maybe I ought to hunt them. I still felt bad though. I would've collected meat but my freezer was already full. This hunt felt lackluster, I had been feeling burnt out about my passion. Maybe I would take a break. Maybe I would move on to bigger prey. I snapped out of my reverie as I saw my car.



I sat down in the living and set to enjoying my dinner. Some stew made with meat from a prior hunt. The rich porky taste was an experience. I turned on the T.V and flipped the news on. What I saw gave me a good chuckle. The newscaster reported with misplaced disgust; ""The New York Skinner has struck again, claiming his twenty sixth victim."" It panned to an interview with a police officer. Right where I had left my victim. With my recognition and amusement I turned off the T.V and enjoyed my stew.",shortscarystories

I get to run through all sorts of fandom worlds, meet Harry Potter and chat with the Avengers. That's cool, but sometimes they don't make sense and things gets mashed together and people's faces gets twisty and well, weird.

But sometimes they aren't like that, but I never remember those. I always tries to remember them, but I never could. Sometimes it's frustrating really, I try so hard and then catches a whip of memory and there it goes again. And the curiosity is killing me.

I was scrolling through Pinterest, when I found a pin about how to hypnotise yourself to recall lost memories. Curious, I tried it out.

It worked.

And as my phone smashes against the floor into a million pieces, so did my mind.

With Thanksgiving behind us, we're looking at the end of the year, and the Christmas/Holidays Contest is coming up next week. Let's not get ahead of ourselves, though. We still need to celebrate the winners of our Thanksgiving 2019 Contest!

"I was at the funfair with my group of friends late at nigt. One of them was Victoria. I had had a crush on her forever, but she hadn't shown any signs of liking me back. Imagine my surprise, then, when she convinced me to sneak away from the rest to ride the Ferris wheel. Hopeful, I followed her. She even held my hand. I felt alive. Finally, I thought, something would happen between us. Things didn't turn out as I hoped though. From the top of the Ferris wheel, I saw my group of friends – including my crush – leave the Funfair without me. Scared to the bones, I slowly turn my head toward the person next to me.",shortscarystories
"She wasn't sure what time it was, but her husband's firm hands working on her ankles had lulled her out of a deep sleep, and she now laid there, hands instinctively moving to cup her growing belly, half asleep and half not. Her half-opened eyes saw darkness, some moonlight, and nothing else.

Her ankles had been swollen for a week now. Her mother told it was natural. All pregnant women went through it, and it was just something she'd have to weather through.

Still, she thought, half-smiling, natural or not, it was nice to have some relief like this. 

It was at this moment that a memory slid into her consciousness. The memory of kissing her husband at the door, of wishing him a safe work trip overseas.

And it was at this moment that the hands stopped touching her.",shortscarystories
"Everyone knew about Old Man Murray's. It was one of those hometown legends that most small towns in the US had, legends that develop out of people's fascination with the paranormal. That and boredom. It was a local tradition to go out to Murray's and try and catch a glimpse of the ghost that supposedly lurked there. Guys would bring girls out there hoping to literally scare the pants off of them.

There was a trick to rousing the ghost for your viewing pleasure. You knocked on the door three times. You yelled out his name three times. And if you saw him you ran like hell.

Billy Ferguson was dating one of the best looking girls at school, Chelsea Whitesell. He had been trying to get into her pants for months to no avail, but he was already making plans for this weekend. He felt that this was the one that he'd finally go the distance with Chelsea. He had put a new condom in his wallet, worrying that the one he'd kept in there had gone bad after the eons of misuse. He planned to take her to Old Man Murray's, get her good and scared.

It seemed like a good plan.

\######

Their headlights skimmed over the old highway as they looked for the turn off. The sun was completely gone and what little light left was just an afterthought. Billy was anxious and a little scared, but that was okay because Chelsea was also and she clung to him.

\######

Leland reached for the stereo and fiddled with it. He was a little too loose, a little too drunk, and when he felt the road get rougher he looked up to see himself heading towards the ditch. He slammed the brakes with little effect and he was thrown all over the cab. When he recovered, his head was aching and his windshield cracked. He stumbled out of the truck to assess the damage.

Headlights appeared over a small incline. He saw the vehicle turn off on a side road. He realized he was near Old Man Murray's. He went back to get something out of his truck and set off on foot.

\#####

“Old Man Murray! Old Man Murray! Old Man Murray!” Billy yelled, while Chelsea hunkered down in fear.

Nothing happened.

“See Chelsea? It’s all fake.”

\######

Leland could see a girl and a boy. The girl was *fine* too. Bad thoughts filled his brain and something cold rose within him. It was something that had always been there. It had been so long since he got some that he hadn’t had to pay for. His head ached and rang, partly from the alcohol, partly from the wreck, partly from something else.

\######

Billy saw a man walking towards them carrying a shotgun.

“M-m-murray?” he stammered.

The man laughed for a long time.

“Nah kid. Some things are worse than ghosts.” the man said. The shotgun was steady in his hand.",shortscarystories
I really don’t know how to explain this. It’s very confusing and worrying but i will be ok. I keep having this dream (well I’m staying in the dream) where it’s just repeating my life over and over. All I do is watch my life fall right in front of me having my first boyfriend from getting married. It’s just none stop I’m really scared.,shortscarystories
"I've always been a logical man. I work at an accounting job and have a few good friends. I'm ordinary and have a strict routine that I follow at the exact minute. I always thought that people scared of supernatural beings were stupid.

Three weeks ago, somebody died in the city next to ours in strange circumstances. The people on the radio said that there was an unrecognizable substance all over the body. I didn't think too much about it.

Exactly one week later, somebody died under the same circumstances.But it happened in our city. I thought that it was some killer who had made a new deadly acid.I still found it weird that both of the people were found dead laying in their beds. But I still went about my day.

Last night, (exactly one week later) , I heard a  liquid passing through my staircase (I was in my bed) Shortly after, I heard the following words :""Sweet dreams"". I ran out of my house and called 911. They sent the police, only to find a little puddle of the same liquid in my room. I think its coming for me.

Please help",shortscarystories
"I opened my eyes, or rather realised they've been opened for some time. 

The rook, clouded with black and blue shades of darkness, began to come into focus, and the objects around me - albeit obviously known to me - only now started to take shape. 

It was there, in the only dark corner left. 
I locked on that mass of darkness with my eyes, knowing perfectly that it was just as well locked on me. 

I tried to move my finger. Just a little flinch - and I would be coming on top. But deep down in my heart, in my mind that was aching with desperation - I knew, that there was no winning tonight. I knew perfectly that time would come, and no doctor, no pill, no muscle meddling would be able to save me. 

My eyes started to burn, my breath became fact, erratic. All I saw, all the silhouettes in my room became blurry, indistictable.

But then... Everything snapped back into focus, and for a brief moment my heart sprung with hope that it was just another night. 

Yet something was undeniably weird about the room. All the furniture was misplaced, and there was no dark kroner in which the apparition would fork to stalk me. 

And then it hit me: not piece furniture was moved, in fact, everything in the room was in place but for me. 

I locked my eyes on the bed, perceiving some slight movements. And then, with a slight shift of the clouds, revealing just enough moonlight, the picture before me was complete. From the bed, my own two eyes, filled with fear, were staring at... Me?",shortscarystories
"When my partner and I arrived at the scene, the little girl’s room was as loud and bright as a Rush concert. The Parents were hysterical, but we were able to get the gist of what was going on. The girl is in the room, no one knows where the lights and noise are coming from, and the door wont open. My partner, Hoss, roughly 20 years my senior, threw his shoulder in the door. Hoss is 280 pounds of pork chops and sheppard’s pie, that door should’ve gave in. But it didn’t. 

The lights and noise stopped, and the door finally caved. Hoss fell into the room with the Mom and Dad trampling over top of him. The little girl was lifeless, surrounded by scorch marks. 

I stepped away from the scene and got on the horn. I told dispatch to send a medic ASAP. When I turned around, Hoss had the kid in his arms. The kid had just started the transition, looked like she could be saved, but honestly, who knows. Hoss took her over to the table and started giving her the once-over. Dispatch came back asking for specifics.

“Hoss,” I said, “give me something. HQ wants specifics.”

He was looking through her hair, between her toes, and inside her mouth. Any markings, bruises, or tattoos we could get some insight from. 

“Hoss,” I groaned, “come on!”

“She’s.” He stuttered, “She looks fine.”

Hoss opens her eyes. He pauses and looks back at me. I could see it in his eyes. I think we all could. The Mom and Dad stopped fighting against me and started to beg for leniency.  

“It’s her eyes”, I sighed, “isn’t it.”

Hoss nodded and stepped back. I got on the horn with dispatch again.

“Dispatch. They got her. They’re beleivers.”

Hoss walked away and punched the wall. I looked at the parents and drew my weapon.

“The kids got no soul. These sons of bitches are smuggling souls.”",shortscarystories

""Sir, it appears that the victim didn't jump on their own will, they were forced to use the window in winter conditions. This is 2nd degree murder!"" ""Agreed, why is the group name only symbols?"" 

""Well Sir, that part was heavily encrypted, all of the devices in the home were wiped, including most of this phone. Forensics were able to recover this conversation. They're still working on the group name."" ""Keep me posted, highest priority! Let's take these bastards down!"" He replied.

Two weeks later: ""Sir the forensics department finally encrypted the name!! Its Mordors' Other Demonic Soldiers!""

The Senior Detective's face flushed, a cold sweat becoming very visible... ""Loose the phone! We never decrypted it!"" he yelled. ""But Sir? We have them dead to rights... we're going to take these bastards down!"" I retorted.

This seasoned officer whom I had never seen flinch looked genuinely afraid... He grabbed me by the collar and slammed me into the wall. ""You have no idea who you're messing with! This group, they're everywhere, always listening, they will make you disappear and if they can't, they'll find someone who can. If you challenge them, you will disappear! Do you understand me???""

I was baffled, I'd never seen him shaken like this... he added ""They're probably listening right now! You must apologize to them... Seriously apologize out loud! Now!""

I straightened up and said ""I'm sorry I challenged the Mordors' Other??"" He interjected ""Jesus, just use their acronym.. they're extremely impatient!""

"
Her name was Sarah, not that anyone called her that, because Sarah knew it all. Sarah was good at maths and english, and art and history. Sarah knew that the sun was a star and not a planet. Sarah knew how babies were made. Most of all, Sarah knew what happened when people died.

Because Sarah, at one point, had died too. 

Sarah talked about a before and after. A before Sarah. But she did not talk about this much. 

But Sarah did talk about other things. Sarah talked about hiking in beautiful places, about swimming with colorful fish. Sarah also talked about less interesting topics, like politics. Little Sarah talked like an adult sometimes. But for someone so smart, some teacher’s did not like her.

Especially Miss Nelly. Sometimes, Miss Nelly would stare at Sarah, and Sarah would stare back. The other children would be much too focused on their books, or too focused on chatting to each other to notice. But there were often moments like those, moments of tension and an unsettling connection between the two. But what everyone did notice that Miss Nelly did not like Sarah. 

Miss Nelly was often cold and rude to little Miss Know-it-all. Tight-lipped, tense, and never offering a smile. Miss Nelly routinely refused to look at little Sarah in the eye. But on the rare times she did, Ms Nelly seemed to look away immediately, with an anguished and fearful look in her aged face.

Because little Miss Know-it-all, knew it all, and Sarah knew Nelly Osborne’s secret. 

Miss Nelly knew about before Sarah. Miss Nelly knew about the broken body her troubled son put in the water. Ms Nelly had helped him bury the body that soon floated atop the calm waters of the lake near the Osborne’s home. She helped bury a woman, but now returned was a child. A child who on her first day of class with Ms Nelly said to her...

" I always loved those picture books. 

  
  You know, the ones where you find xyz in this jumbled up mess of images. Those and Where's Waldo books were my absolute favorites, and a few shelves full of these books decorate my apartment to this day.      
  Needless to say, I got extremely good at seeing the little things in life.  I got really good at reading the little gestures that people made.  You'd be surprised at how often your body portrays what you are really feeling regardless of how well you can hide it.   

  
  At first, this power was enjoyable.  I could see the details in every flower, making them more beautiful to me, or could see when someone was secretly upset and befriend them to make them happier.   

  
  However, this took a turn around a week ago.  Ever since I noticed my special abilities, I could see things that aren't quite right.  It started with a tree that seemed too...straight if that makes sense.  Then, it was a stop sign that was too red.   

   
Today, while on a walk through the park, I stopped and focused on a “No Littering” sign. Something was off, something surreal about it.  That's when I realized that the sign was staring back at me.  I gasped in shock, and jumped back.  Apparently with its' disguise uncovered, a tall, skinny, twisted figure peeled itself off the sign with a sickening pop.  I froze, staring at this unreal creature.  That's when I heard a million pops from the surrounding trees.",shortscarystories
"Truck drivers face alot of challenges throughout the course of their career. Most drug related, a few bad accidents, but my most difficult challenge isn't either of those things. I guess my tale will go down as the ghost stories we drivers pass around to each other. So don't believe me if you want but either way, don't go looking for trouble. 

It's was about 3:45am when my eyes started to feel heavy. My brain said sleep but my paycheck said work, if you know what I mean. Regardless of money, my yawns got the better of me and I decided to stop somewhere nearby. It seemed like fate because, almost the second I made up my mind, a Diner came into view. Perfect, I thought while pulling into the huge parking lot. 

Right above the glass door entryway stood a faded neon sign. It read:

Morningstar Cafe!
Open 24/7

The name sounded as good to me as any, I was very tired and hungry. Thoughts of a pecan pie lured me into the small quaint building. The inside was chromed out like a retro diner would be and behind the counter sat a man polishing glass cups one by one. 

No greeting just:
""Take a menu"" he handed me a small list of microwavable food without looking up from his task.
I didn't mind the old guy though, never was one for small talk. But he sure did have a creepy quality to him. The menu had a picture of a crudely drawn woman with a cowboy hat, a red flannel top, and short shorts. At first, her hat caught my eye,

It read 
""let us be the morning  after the stars"".

But then I noticed a much more odd slogan printed in large letters on the bottom of the menu.
""Employee's must wash hands""

What a odd place for that sign. Usually those are in bathrooms so why would this place remind everyone of bowel movements while looking at their food. It seems like a horrible marketing strategy on their half.

Curiosity got the better of me and I decided to ask the rude man still shining any cup he could find. 
""Why is the bathroom door sign on the menu? Seems like a bad idea""

He snapped out of his trance and froze while facing away. A chill ran through my spine and I was about to say ""nevermind"" when he finally spoke again. 

""Wait right here""

Those words were straight out of a horror movie but I couldn't seem to move until he came back with a large plastic tub. Before I could ask about it he tossed it on the table and the content scattered everywhere. 

My mind didn't want to believe it at first but the smell proved it to be true. Severed hands littered the table like a cannibal butcher shop. My heart dropped into my stomach and I realized I couldn't scream. I wanted to more than anything but my body wouldn't let me. Then he spoke again. 

""They're super clean. Our employees wash fresh ones daily""

The sentence released me from the bizarre trance and I ran. I ran to my rig and got the fuck out of dodge. He didn't try to stop me.  

Thats pretty much all i remember before the accident. Cops peeled me out of the vehicle with the jaws of life. They told me I wouldn't stop screaming about a murderer at a truck stop nearby but there wasn't one around for miles. Strangely, I'm not surprised by this. Diner food is hell.",shortscarystories
"""You should always keep your hands to yourself"" was what we were told on our first day at grade school.  It made sense, no one likes to be pushed, punched, slapped or pinched.  Whether you're a big kid or a little one, keeping your hands to yourself was always the main rule.  Oh, that and sharing, as we got older, we were always expected to share our playthings with the other kids.

That's why I'm confused.  I've kept 4 pairs of hands from those kids who went missing, but I don't think the other boys and girls will want to share them with me.",shortscarystories
"There is a legend of spirit unknown
Prowling the forest in night.

You spy the creature in distance.
A blink, and gone from sight.

It's bone, petrified and cracked.
The moonlight pale, without fail,
The creature has you, you're trapped.

Keep still now, do not test.
Or the beast will feast upon your flesh.
Remain calm and do not stare.
For you have entered it's home, it's lair.

You still have a chance, a hope, a try.
Act as I say, you will not die.
I know it is close, you feel it's breath.
It's whispers of cold and black and death.

It is testing your worth, stare down.
What do you see?
It has given you flesh, the flesh is the key.
Consume my child, and you will be freed.

You are now worthy of the beast,
And now you must return below.
And you shall join them in their feast,
Child of the Wendigo.",shortscarystories
" My neighbor Bernard has always been really weird, and kind of obnoxious. He’s an ex-FBI agent in his early 70s, and in the past decade that he’s been retired he’s driven multiple people out of the house directly next door to him with his antics. He has cameras set up all around the perimeter of his house, he flips out if anyone comes on his property without permission, he calls the police if multiple cars are parked in the cul-de-sac; he’s just a real Get Off My Lawn type. Me and my family have always gotten along well enough with him though, because we’ve lived on a the street a long time, almost as long as him, so we’re civil with him and stay out of his way the rest of the time.

Despite being a law man, Bernard follows a strict schedule all the time. You’d think he wouldn’t, since it would make it easier for criminals to observe his behavior and rob him or whatever, but he does. Each morning, he drives up to the grocery store for a coffee and a Danish. Other than that, we rarely see him leave his house. On Friday evenings, he has a pizza delivered, which we assume he eats for the rest of the weekend, as he never leaves his house from Friday until Monday morning, except to get the mail. He peers out of his windows all the time, staring at the street, watching everything that goes on. 

For the last month, I haven’t seen Bernard much. My parents were out of town, so I was busier and not paying much attention to him. I did notice, however, each Friday the pizza man continued to come, I would usually see his car pulling in around 6pm, about 30 minutes after I would return home from work. So I assumed Bernard was alive and well, I just wasn’t seeing him as much, and maybe he’d actually stopped spending so much time staring out his windows at the street.

I was wrong. Bernard died five weeks ago. The pizza delivery guy found out the day after it happened. He’d been delivering to Bernard for a while, and was concerned when he didn’t call in his usual Friday pizza. He drove to the house, let himself in the back, and found Bernard dead on his couch. But he didn’t tell anyone. Instead, he’s been slowly consuming him in the weeks following. We only found out because he got to Bernard’s brain and contracted a prion disease, landing him in the hospital, where he’ll likely die. Almost the most disturbing part of the whole thing is that he didn’t even cook or refrigerate Bernard. He has been sitting there decomposing and this guy has just been coming over once a week, eating him. This has all been happening one house away from mine, and I feel like I will have to move now, I feel sick every time I pull into my street.",shortscarystories
"Every town has its legends. No less was true for a certain rural sprawl in the southeastern united states.; the locals of which were not particularly superstitious, leaning heavily on the teachings of the bible. 

The legend tells of a mysterious entity who would watch over you while you sleep. He would stand just outside your window at night. He would not disturb you in any way. That is, as long as you don't look at him...

Few have seen this man, this...thing, and lived to tell about it. For if you are to make eye contact with him, something horrible happens to you. The few who lived to recount their encounters have said that the man vanishes from your window as soon as you make eye contact. You naturally assume it was your imagination or a trick of the light and go to sleep. 

As you drift into a dream state, he reappears in front of you and stares at you with his hollow sockets for eyes, you try to escape but you keep running into him. The longer you try to escape his nightmare the longer you will remain asleep. 

People who came out of months-long comas in the area claim they had been trapped in his nightmare for what felt like an eternity. They all said they couldn't remember how they had escaped.

But those lucky few came out with only mild damage to their psyche. Most either stay in a coma until they die or, at best, spend the rest of their days in an asylum. 

Don't look out ypur window at night...for there you may find the man in the window...watching you...waiting to trap you in his world...forever.",shortscarystories
"Stop me if you've heard this one before: So I live in a pretty tight-knit neighborhood. Everybody's on a first-name basis, you know? We look out for each other, in our own ways. 

Like this one time, my neighbor, May, she went on vacation to Spain. We kept an eye on her house while she was away, making sure sure it didn't get burgled or burnt down while she was off sunbathing and eating tapas. It's just that kind of neighbourhood. 

So when one of my other neighbors, Frank, started going through a rough divorce, we were all worried about him. Poor guy had always been a little odd - you know, on the sensitive side - and when his wife left him, well, he was inconsolable. The night Jane walked out, all of us knew to keep watch, just in case.

Every night since the split, I'd gone over and played cards with him, just to keep his mind off things. He was smiling, but only ever with his mouth. He just had this blank, vacant stare the whole time, you know the kind older men tend to have?

It was a pleasant surprise when I came over one evening to play, and he didn't respond to my knock on the door. I could hear voices inside - the TV, turned up real loud.

When I checked through the living room window - just to be safe, you know? - I see him and Jane, sitting together on the couch, just watching TV. Frank was smiling, eyes fixed to the TV. Blank, vacant stare. He and Jane were embracing.

Next morning, our nice little neighborhood was crawling with police, as they pushed two covered stretchers into the back of a van. This wouldn't've been such a shock to me if I'd looked up the night before, and seen the two frayed wires where Frank had ripped the carbon monoxide detector out of the ceiling.",shortscarystories
" By the time I was five, my father already owned five companies. 

I was the third child of a Harvard graduate and a socialité known among the city’s wealthy society. My father was always on business trips abroad and my mother often spent long nights in another man’s bed, so we were practically raised by the maids. I don’t remember much about them. They came and went for different reasons: one retired, one fell ill, one got out of the country. If you’d ask me to even name one, I probably couldn’t. In my twenty years of life, there is only one of those women I can tell you anything about. And that was Sunny.

Sunny came into my life early, when I was around six or seven. She seemed to be always looking out for me and my siblings, cooking meals, folding our clothing, even going to the point of playing with us when our childish desires wanted to be fulfilled. I have never met someone who worked as hard as her. I can’t recall seeing her going to the bathroom, or napping, or eating, or even having a glass of water like a normal being would do. I actually spent a long time thinking that she even wasn’t human, making up crazy conspirational delusions about monsters or witches. 

Another thing that made Sunny so memorable was her farewell. Unlike most of the other maids, I can think of when she left us. She didn’t say goodbye: one day, she simply wasn’t there. My father told us she had found another job overseas and had moved. Nothing out of the ordinary when it came to a maid. But the reason why I remember her departure so vividly was because around the same time, my mother got in a fatal accident that left her bed-ridden for weeks. She eventually came back, though; badly injured and bandaged everywhere, but alive. And life went on.

Finally, Sunny had one of the strangest birthmarks I’ve ever seen. It covered her entire left eye with a reddish hue that had a brown gradient, and it protruded on her eyebrow. It used to scare me when I was little and I had never seen anything like that. I got used to it, though, and the birthmark stopped bothering me as soon as I grew up. 

Until yesterday, when I caught my mother taking off her makeup in her bathroom. 

I quickly saw that red birthmark again when the foundation wore off.  

Now that I’ve been thinking about it, there has been a foul smell coming from the cellar for a long time.",shortscarystories

"I go for a jog in the dead of night, too. It’s a three kilometers route through the city park, familiar for anyone who’s lived here long enough and so always occupied by runners – not so much at this time though. It’s quiet then, where the only sounds are my own breaths, my shoes hitting the ground and crickets chirping all around. I’m all alone for the most part, except for the one or two I come across. Everything about the run puts my mind at ease.

That does not mean you can let down your guard, though. Take note of your surroundings at all times, as the route at night can be very disorienting.

It is common for the bushes to rustle. It is a park with wildlife, after all. Your first clue should be how the rustling speeds up all of a sudden, even when it is a windless night. It quickly fades as you run further away, and voices will begin to seep through ahead and around the corner. It is a voice of a woman deep in conversation, cheery and flirty which does not belong to the time of the night – when you round the bend, you’ll find nobody there.

It is imperative that you turn around now and *sprint* \- out of the park and back home.

If you do continue on, you’ll find no trouble for the rest of the route, until you realise that you’ve not seen another runner for the whole of the route. This is when you hope that a patch of maple trees comes after the willows. Pray to god you run past the red veranda (*built in memory of Mary J. Hoover)* only once. If you find yourself running along rows upon rows of endless willow trees, you’ll most certainly see the veranda, take a left, see the veranda, take another left and see that blood red veranda again.

You’re in trouble. What comes next is a woman’s voice within the trees, calling out your name. *Hey, David. Are you lost? You always will be.* You’ll stay on the path, where three kilometres stretch into six and minutes become hours but night does not turn into day.

How do you escape that? You can’t. You should have turned around when you had the chance to. You've gone too far.

When you finally get tired and stop, I’ll be right behind you.",shortscarystories
"Life isn’t easy when you’re a single college student. Especially when you’re a guy. A 21-year-old South Korean to be exact.

Neal struck out pretty often. Even more frustrating was that I was reasonably handsome. I stayed in shape. My round face accentuated by my spiked black hair… With the boom of K-pop, I figured I’d be causing a mass hysteria like The Beatles.

But that wasn’t the case. I stayed alone in my dorm. And this December night no different... 

I sat at the computer. Tonight was slow on the dating apps. Drunk and frustrated, I went into emergency mode… searching for a fresh, new dating app.

Shivering in the cold, I stole a glance at my closed dorm door. And then on my phone, I found it: a brand new dating app with a four star rating. *EatYourHeartOut*

Bots be damned, I downloaded the fucker. Made an account.

Almost immediately, a notification box popped up: *Allow “EatYourHeartOut” to access your location while you are using the app?*

Of course, I hit yes. Standard stuff for these sorts of shitshows.

Before I could even scout the scene, I had to make a brief bio. Upload the requisite photos. Slog through the validation process as if I were undergoing a medical exam.

My phone then jolted to life. Over and over. Notifications poured in. Rather than excitement, I felt disappointed. Gotta be bots, I figured. Not even the ugly girls were desperately waiting on new members.

I clicked on my profile pic. The shirtless photo was now getting countless likes. Countless comments.

Intrigued, I scrolled through them. And in the chilling loneliness, I became unnerved.

*He looks yummy!* a middle-aged dad said. *Can’t wait to cut into that ass!* exclaimed an exuberant soccer mom.

Battling the unease, I looked around the dorm. For once, I was glad to be alone…

Another vibration pulled me back to the app. *Looks like we’re having Chinese tonight1!* said a bearded country guy.

Angry, I replied to him: *I’m Korean, asshole!*

More comments arrived. *Young and tasty!!!!* *I’ll sure eat his heart out!!1*

My eyes darted to the corner of the screen. To *EatYourHeartOut*’s obnoxious title. Lettering reserved for a diner’s neon sign. One that was open all night…

I got ready to delete the damn thing. Until a new comment caught my eye. *I’m on the way for you!* said a muscular man.

Panicking, I went to the locals page. There my profile pic stood in the center of the singles sea. The middle of this menu.

A smaller caption under my pic read: *10 miles away, FSU Campus. Azalea Hall, Room 17*

My location.

Trembling, I went to my messages. For once, the flooded inbox gave me fear rather than excitement. *I’m hungry and thirsty...* *Can't wait to m(eat) you ;)*

“Oh shit!” I said, scared beyond belief.

A brutal knock hit my door. Slowed by dread, I turned to face it. 

Several other knocks pounded it at once.",shortscarystories
"I love taking long, extravagant showers. I lather my lavender scented shampoo through my blonde hair. I pride myself on keeping it nice and natural. I’ve never bleached or dyed it, for fear of it getting damaged. It always stays beautiful, shiny, and blonde. Next, I apply my hair mask, and wait in the shower for the 10 minutes it’s supposed to stay in. One of the benefits of living alone is being able to shower as long as I want. It helps in maintaining my beautiful hair.

During my shower, I notice that the water is having some trouble draining. That happens sometimes, with me having such long, voluminous hair. I was smart enough to invest in a removable shower drain, because I knew I’d have this problem. I even have a net that catches all my hair that falls down there, for easy cleaning! I take the drain off to clean out the net.

Immediately, I recoil in disgust. Inside is not my beautiful blonde hair, but long, thick, black hairs. How could those have gotten there? Nobody else uses this shower, especially not enough to completely clog up my drain with their hair. Has someone been breaking in to use my shower? Have they been using my expensive hair products? That’s the only logical conclusion I can come to here. Should I call the police? Probably not, I don’t think they would take my shower drain as valid evidence. I need to figure this out on my own.

I buy a small motion detector camera, and place it on my bathroom counter. Any time someone steps into my bathroom, a speaker will sound an alarm and notify my phone. That way, I can always be sure to know anytime someone enters my bathroom.

I wasn’t expecting to be woken up by the alarm the very same night I set it up. I immediately shot awake, ready to run to the bathroom. Only...I was already in the bathroom. I couldn’t breathe.

I was hunched over the bathtub, my eyes watering with pain. Out of my throat falls clumps of long, thick, black hair.",shortscarystories
" 
I sat in my room, like I always do. Holding the rusty old copper frame that I was given when I was a boy, not knowing what would happen the week after.

It was 2002 My dad and I came back from football practise at the happy lane. We entered the garage in the clean cut Honda model. My dad said he would be right back but he left me forwards not able to see his face, I took his life for granted.

Now here I am.

*THUMP!*

What was that, was it my neighbours? Maybe, I only have a kitchen next door. This is not good, I thought. I looked and there it was ‘the list’ well that it was I thought more like screens. Opposite ‘the list’ was everything I thought of; the good, the bad and death - yes death. But I did not see anything about death that I had thought of. The smell of the erotic fibres, every scenraio played at once of what I could image doing to myself in harmful ways. But this wasn’t it, no ghosts, no spirit not even my dad. But I could feel something that was there in my stomach and I didn’t know how to feel.

*THUMP!*

The thump was actually burglars dressed in black in white strips from the cartoons smashing fridge-freezer that never worked due to it’s small wires that could never reach my plug. 

They had seen me when I entered, in a panic one of them grabbed the rigged cut knife from his pocket and you guessed it. I was stabbed in the stomach death had found me, the burglars in panic ran off, stealing anything that was available.

Blood dripped, my floor filled with my own blood like a bloody storm.

Now I think you know what is going to happen.",shortscarystories
"Monsters. Throughout my entire existence, I’ve had at least one of them in my life at any given time. I attract monsters, or maybe it’s me whos attracted to them. 


It started with the Pastor. Man of God, loving husband, and my father. He believed the stick was superior to the carrot in enforcing God’s will upon children. My smallest “sins” were rewarded with dozens of lashes. I would spend every night crying alone in my room praying to God to take away the pain, but he never answered. 


I ran away as soon as I turned sixteen. He was the first boy, who showed me what I believed at that time to be real affection. The fact that he was a Biker didn’t hurt either. We were hormonal kids who thought we were in love. But that wore off quickly, and it didn’t take me long to realize that I’ve only swapped one monster for another. 


I didn’t have enough courage to get away from him until I met the Broker. Finally I met someone who treated me like a queen. I thought my prayers were being answered. All the beautiful things I never had and thought I never could have were now at my feet. I was the happiest I’ve ever been. Looking back, I should have known it was too good to be true. It wasn’t long before he dropped his figurative halo and showed me his real horns and tail.


They say the worst monsters are the ones that we bring with us. Now I’m on the run again. But I am not free from this one last monster. Not for another nine months.",shortscarystories
"The dark-wooden face saw its brows constrict, its jaw move, its traits distort. Its winces, coupled with the puppeteer's well-rhythmed wales, made the group of children shriek and coil, the three young brothers seeking comfort in fraternal arms. They then ran away, furthering their distance with the haunted house's employee. Such a fright he had caused, as others by the past weeks, only made him prouder of his talent.

However, with each wale voiced his throat felt hoarser and drier, due to his own usual tone hardly qualifying as pitchy. He decided taking a pause wouldn't hurt for now, and avidly wanted some water. Hence, he engulfed himself away from the dim light a hidden bulb provided through the eyes of a monster on the wall.

As he walked his way, slowly as to not hurt a wanderer customer, a thought, an idea the crawling creeps this place's atmosphere brought him, hatched. As it had just been two weeks since he accepted this nightly gig, he had never even seen the place lighted. He would definitely find this a cool sight. Filled with such a sentiment, he then planned on asking his employer.

But, as he continued adventuring himself in the dark, using his good old, loyal puppet to fumble about, he felt as if a movement grazed him... He froze and thought, his neck as if chilling. But, perhaps, an idea came as an angel trying to comfort him in his loneliness, perhaps it had just been a fly? Or some other bug, since summer surely hit warmer outside, and the dark would not fend them off in the slightest.

Shrugging it off, he went on. Yet, thinking back about the way he had taken, it seemed to him he had gone the wrong way. However, where to go, then? Turning back, he knew his orientation had failed him. Damn! His phone was in his bag,  in the workers' room... That meant, he could not use the flash-light to find his way.

At first, his hand felt antsy. The sensation then only grew. To work here, he was definitely not afraid of the black. But why would his hand tremble so? No, something had to be off and eerie. Whatever that was, it touched his flesh, inside the puppet's glove! It itched as if some repeated insect bites, his skin hurting, the pain warning him. Even blind, he instinctively knew where his hand was, and tried getting the glove off!

After much pain, his skin as if screaming, the glove fell to the floor. The noise of wood hammering the floor brought him relief. However, as he began running, seeking proximity near the dim bulb's shimmer, he looked back, more and more afraid as he could only make out the puppet's face, flying and nearing.",shortscarystories
"There was once a little thief who found a strange long box. It was covered in the most unusual symbols he had ever seen. 

On instinct, he tried to open it. 

But it was locked. 

The thief then used his screwdriver. That too failed. 

Enraged, he slammed his fist against the box’s meticulously crafted top. Again. Nothing happened. 

The thief flipped open his trusty switchblade, and thrust it into the box’s keyhole. He twisted it. 

And it was picked, a clicking sound reverberated. 

His limbs and head went numb. 

But he didn’t care. 

He lifted the lid. 

And his body fell apart.",shortscarystories
"You ever have one of those mornings where everything’s just a bit...off?

Like you can’t put your finger on it, but from the moment you wake up someone adjusted reality and now everything’s different. You get out of bed and you don’t remember the floor being quite so far away, or this many clothes strewn about. The sink takes a bit longer to turn on than normal, and you’re sure your toothbrush was put away but there it is on the counter. Nothing too out of place, but nothing where it should be, either.

But you have work to get to, so you ignore the feeling, get in the shower, and wince from the heat because somehow your usual faucet setting is off and now you’re worried about whether you’ve scalded yourself. So you rinse off and get out and look at the time and instead of five minutes it’s been almost twenty, and if you don’t hurry you’ll be late. Yet finding clothes is such a hassle, putting them on even more so...

Sitting in your car, you stare at the ignition. The keys are in but it won’t turn on. You try again, and this time it sputters to life. Which is weird, because you’ve never had problems with the engine before. And why is the radio on? You look for the aux cord and see it unplugged on the dash. On second thought, no music. Better to just drive in silence.

Driving is hard too. It’s like your hands won’t stop shaking and the wheel won’t stop turning and thank god there’s no one else on the road, because this is the third time you’ve gone into the other lane. Just a couple more blocks, it’s not even that far, yet it feels like miles, a real journey. You slide into the parking lot and attempt to fit into a spot and end up in two. Who cares. At least you’re there.

Opening the door, you forget your seatbelt is still fastened and momentarily struggle to escape. Why is everything so hard today? Why can’t you stop shaking? What’s up with this pounding headache that won’t go away, that makes you feel like you’re going to throw up from the pain, that makes the rising sun almost burn your skin?

You stumble forward, a single thought in your mind: get inside. You’ll be fine if you can just get inside.

“Doug? Hey, Doug, you okay, man? You don’t look so good...”

Talking. Someone is talking. To you? Are you Doug? You must be, because now they’re stopping you and touching your shoulder. Why are they touching you. You just want to get inside.

“Hey, Doug, talk to me—you’re seriously freaking me oH MY GOD!!!”

It’s too late. The pain is too powerful. You give in and feel your skin erupt in flames, a shriek coming from your lungs as the fire consumes you, cursing whoever stopped you from fleeing this agony. You just wanted to go inside.",shortscarystories
"Greg sat on his front porch like he did every night. Ever since Genie died its always been like this. Cold beers in the cooler and a pack of his favorite cigarettes.
Luci, Greg’s dog, laid there panting.
“Luci,” Greg started as he inhaled smoke into his lungs.
“I miss your momma more and more each day,” Greg said as he looked out into the cornfield, shaking his head he finished the beer.
Luci began to let out a low growl. Greg ignored her and opened a new beer. Luci started barking.
“Luci, be quiet,” Greg murmured. Luci continued to bark and ran out into the cornfield.
“LUCI COME BACK HERE. WE DON’t GO OUT THERE NO MORE!” Greg stood up got his flashlight and followed her.
“LUCI DAMN IT, COME BACK HERE!” Greg yelled. The barking stopped, but not just the barking. It was as if the world became quiet, with no sound of wind or even crickets. Greg swallowed hard and pushed forward through the thickness that overwhelmed him.
Luci was on top of a mound of dirt. Greg looked around the rest of the cornrows with his flashlight.
“You ok Luci?” He said. He pointed the light back onto where Luci was but she was gone. There was a hole where she had been laying. Greg slowly walked to look into the hole. He placed the beam of light into it. The remains were still there, but no sign of Luci. Panic started to spread through his body. He looked around him frantically.
“LUCI! LUCI! LUCI WHERE ARE YOU!?” Greg screamed at the top of his longs. This caused him to cough for a moment. Once he caught his breath he looked closer at the hole. The bones were in there for sure, but it looked like somewhere missing.
A bark came from behind him. He spun around but nothing was there. He heard it again coming from the direction of the house. He ran with all his might.
“IM COMING LUCI! DON’T WORRY IM COMING!” Greg said as he bound up the stairs of the house. His foot caught on the last stair and he went sprawling into the house.
Greg’s head was spinning. He shook it slowly, trying to get his thoughts back together. His flashlight was on the floor pointing down the hall, illuminating Luci. Her back was turned to him. She had long black hair now. There was a skeleton hand next to her. Silence had come once again to still the world.
“Luci?” Greg said through shakey breaths.
Luci’s head slowly moved back to look Greg in the eyes. Her eyes were like looking into a furnace.
“Genie?” Greg whispered.
She turned fully around and slowly walked towards Greg.
“It...it...cant be,” Greg muttered.
“Yes it can be, and I don’t think you’ll get away with it this time...” Luci said with broken, low, raspy words. She began to bear her teeth, which were now sharp as blades.

It was not due to the lack of evidence.

Most detectives would’ve dropped the case but it wasn't impossible to solve.

A lot of people would’ve seen that every time the killer abducted someone it would be within a 10km range of his house.

Sure it would’ve been hard to find the bodies but surely the greatest detective in the world would see straight through the illusions.

He would simply smell the air and notice that the red paint on the walls was not just regular paint but the blood of the victims.

The Police would be able to find the knife the killer used and while it would be clean of his own DNA the bonesaw he used wouldn’t be.

The greatest detective in the world would walk around in the house and notice one of the floorboards would creak.

There he would find the bones with bite marks which would be identical to the killers own teeth.

And they still haven’t found his body.",shortscarystories
"

&amp;nbsp;
My wife left soon after learning my daughter was blind. Worse yet, it seemed that my daughter could see creatures and places that did not sound like anything on earth, and how these things were universal and ever-tormenting. Luckily, we had help. A blind cat “kept the creatures away”, and a teacher for the blind helped make raising my daughter a little easier. They allowed my daughter use her other sight in a stable environment, and in time, my daughter to lead me across town, through fields and people's homes, describing the details of the shadow people and their tall, cold, silent, sterile cities. She described colors and shapes and compared some creatures to birds or balloons, impossible things for a little blind girl to describe. 

&amp;nbsp;
She met a “friend” on one of these trips- one of the shadow people of the other world. She claimed this one was different, kinder, and was interested in how she could exist in two places at once. I warned my daughter not to talk to strangers, and while she agreed, I heard her whispering in complex conversations to the thin air on many nights. She always denied it, and I always bought it. Then one night, I heard my daughter's voice: “wake up, dad”. I opened my eyes to see my daughter with a spray bottle right against my face, shooting my eyes at point blank range with what felt like fire. 

&amp;nbsp;
My daughter tried to calm me down through my frantic cries.

&amp;nbsp;
“My friend helped me mix the power under the sink in the spray bottle. He said it would help, that if you lost your regular sight too, you could see what I see, and you can help protect me more. Can you see them, daddy? Can you see them around us? That one's my friend...”

I could see nothing but black, feel nothing but fiery burning in the sockets of my corroding eyes. Somewhere in the burning, writing, helpless dark, I heard a laugh I never heard before just before my daughter's screams were swiftly muffled.",shortscarystories
"I woke up one morning super early, probably around 4 AM. I tried rolling over and going back to sleep but something caught my attention. I opened my eyes and noticed a source of light shining. But not a regular house light, this seemed like light from a fire. I crawled out of bed and into the hall. I could tell just by my shadow on the wall that there was definitely a lit candle...but why?

Once downstairs I looked into the kitchen and saw my mom sitting at the table alone. Her back was facing me and it looked like she was reading a book or something. So I softly called out to her, “Mom”. She continued what she was doing but she let out a long, deep tone “Yessssss?” 

I thought the way she said it was weird so I laughed a bit and asked why she said it that way. But my mom didn’t say anything back. I moved towards the kitchen a bit closer. “I can’t sleep mom, is it okay if I get something to eat?” I asked her as I slowly moved closer to the kitchen. Once again in that same slow, deep voice. “Yesssss”

This was unusual behavior from my mom and it was starting to freak me out. So I decided to ask her something that required more than just a yes or no answer. I quickly moved by her and opened the refrigerator. “So, what made you light a candle anyway?” Again with that same tone. “Yesssss”

I turned around and blurted out “mom that’s not even a yes or no question!” I just realized my mom wasn’t sitting there anymore. There wasn’t even a candle lit now. I was just standing in the kitchen by myself in the dark.",shortscarystories

"I heard it first the night of my 18th birthday, and have heard it every night since. A whirring, electronic sound, high pitched, burning my ears. Nothing I do can stop me hearing it, nothing changes it’s pitch, or volume. Like a ringing in the ears after a loud concert, it stays.

Then, to my torment, on the night of my 19th birthday, I saw it. Or rather, I didn’t see. I was blinded by a bright light. From the minute my head touched the pillow, to the break of dawn, my room would be filled with light. I tried covering my face but it did not work. The light stayed the same.

Needless to say, I rarely slept. I was permanently exhausted, moody. Friends started to drift away, some even mumbling about drugs if I tried to explain myself. I moved out of my parent’s house, hoping that the noise and light wouldn’t follow me. But they did.

It was on the night of my 20th birthday that things came to a breaking point. The noise started, the light started and then I felt them. Cold, rough hands probing my body, every inch of my paralyzed, vulnerable self. I tried to sit up and fight them off but I couldn’t. I felt pinpricks as I was injected, or they took blood, or both I’m not sure. I felt the scrape as they scratched off skin cells, and heard the snips as hair was cut off for examination.

On the morning after my 20th birthday, when dawn had broken, I could finally move. I sat up and examined myself. Everything was pretty much the same as always, except for a patch of dry skin on my upper left arm, that seemed cold to the touch.

On the night of my 21st birthday, the noise didn’t come. The light didn’t come. The hands didn’t come. After three years of suffering, they finally came. I looked like them now, my skin dry and rough and cold to the touch. My hair had fallen out, and for that I was glad, the contact caused my scalp to itch. I ceased to wear clothes when I ceased to look female, to look human. Just an asexual figure.

A different light illuminated my room that night. It was soft, inviting. I joined them. It takes three years to gain recruits, and we already have thousands here. We rid them of humanity of the mind, then rid them of humanity of the body. I’m not sure why we do this, but there's tension in the atmosphere. We have received coded messages from others, like ourselves. They seem to spark excitement within the leaders.

The message it simple, and I offer it to you as a warning.

"My newest friend tilts her head, concern illuminated by the flickering glow of the campfire. ""Why do you still listen to that voicemail?"" 

It's the question people ask me wherever I go. The voicemail that tore my heart out, shredded it until I could barely mend the bloody scraps together into a semblance of something that beat. The girl who left it meant everything to me. I loved that girl more than anything in the world, loved her with something that transcended the word, something etheral, divine, to fit the soul my best friend carried. 

I listen to the voicemail to remind myself why we can't be friends anymore. To remind myself not to put my heart on the line like that again, to not trust a word that comes from her mouth. Sirens love the vulnerable. 

I listen to it to weld steel into the remains of my heart, cage it in to protect myself from the cruelty of people like her. Protect myself from someone that spends years with me only in the end to call me horrible, unforgivable names, tear down every aspect of my insecurities until I'm too broken to find what is myself anymore. 

I listen to it to channel my anger. I don't want to lash out at the people in my life who don't deserve the end of my wrath, that which has been simmering in the pit of my stomach for years. 

I listen to it so I'll fight. So I won't be a broken girl desperately in need of someone to trust when I know I've lost that capacity. 

I listen to it to remember the girl I knew before she became a monster. 

There are a lot of reasons I listen to the voicemail. I don't know which one people are looking for, or why they think telling me to stop will fix me. I don't think the truest reason will ease their worriment.

"Christmas is coming! He usually despised it; Halloween was always his favorite holiday. Every year they would get together fitting as many spooky thrills as possible into the week of the holiday. “Week o Ween” they called it, he looked forward to it all year! This year they had all stayed overnight at the haunted asylum. It was the first time he felt that he was in the presence of truly evil spirits. That’s probably why the guides had such strict rules.

He couldn’t remove anything… Shouldn’t is what they should’ve said. They were in the basement; dungeon, described more accurately. The rest of the group was distracted, enthralled by the EMF spikes and audio disruptions. It was the first time he heard a voice in the static. He couldn’t make out the individual words, but he felt a pulling, almost an instinctive urge to slip away and investigate a loose bit of mortar. Picking at it he discovered a small crevice, inside a small golden ring. He’s not sure, but the voice may have encouraged him, gifted it to him. He shouldn’t have taken it; he knew that with certainty now. 

The moment he touched the ring he felt a chill, the clammy cold sweat you get before you vomit was mild compared to this chill. He tried to put it back, but it was now part of him. In the past two months his symptoms have gotten much worse. It felt like his body was dying from the inside out. Just this morning he lost another tooth when he vomited. He’s not completely sure, but he thought there were maggots crawling in the bowl before he flushed. 

He read every article he could find on the subject and realized what he needed to do. The ring was cursed, gifting it to another and them accepting it, was the only way to escape the curse. He couldn’t bring himself to gift it to a friend or family member, especially since they’ve seen how sick he’s become. He tried to gift it to strangers with no luck. People are so questioning these days…. 

But now Christmas was coming!! That meant online Secret Santa time! With the plan formed, he created several burner accounts, providing positive feedback and quality content to gain as many points as possible in a short time. He had no idea who this person was or if they would ever figure it out, he just knew that he would now live. Rings can be an awkward gift, so he hid it inside another gift. Mail the package, wait for the acceptance message, then burn the accounts… 

But first, one last post on the site, a short scary story dedicated to the person who now has the ring… a gift of knowledge of how to escape the curse… more likely a selfish act to alleviate the guilt by giving them a chance.

Christmas is here! This year, it’s the greatest time of year!!

"Everything was frozen in a layer of snow and ice. I stared out the front of my open lean-to at the white wasteland, watching the snow settle even deeper. It was so very cold and I was so very, very hungry. The forearm I had cooked over night was the last of my meat. I sifted through the ashes of my fire and found a couple of burnt fingers to chew on. They weren’t very satisfying. The closest village was a couple miles to the north of my position, it was time to go hunting for my next meal.
 
The small village of Teh’Kuhta was on a remote island in the Hudson Bay, north of Quebec. The villagers had come to both fear and respect the shadow people that lived in the stunted shrublands  of their island. Often they would leave out offerings and occasionally even make a sacrifice in hopes of being left alone. They were frightened of the shadow people, even more so than the great white northern bears that could fell a grown man with one swipe of the paw.
 
The villagers fear me and rightly so. I can move through these wastelands without making a sound, my unbridled strength, rage and hunger have made me into nothing less than death incarnate. Even now I circled their village, not a single dog barked, not a single warrior stirred. They would only know of my presence if I chose to let them know. I spotted my prey not very far away, my stomach grumbled at the thought of food.
 
The dogs were trained not to bark. The villagers were aware of the presence, warriors ever so slightly nodding their heads and using silent hand signals to mark its dark passing. The shadow person was circling their village and they knew it. Their latest offering was being ignored, it wanted something else.
 
I carefully measured each step, each breath, each movement. My quarry was very close now and he had no idea that I was stealthily approaching his back. The villager’s offering wasn’t enough, not this time.
 
The Teh'Kuhta'n warrior silently drew back an arrow, waiting for the shadow person to get just a little closer.
 
I watched the warrior draw back his arrow. I was on all fours now, approaching with the stealth only a true predator can possess. The warrior didn't even see me. I leaped ten feet through the air, came down with a snarl and broke my quarry's neck with my teeth. The taste of hot blood was nice. Swiftly, oh so swiftly I carried my prize back off into the frozen wastelands.
 
The warrior watched it all with a calm complacency, he nodded to his fellow warriors. The village would be safe for another night.
 
I began roasting the spitted shadow person over my roaring fire, my stomach growled in anticipation. I smiled a very large and toothy smile to myself, I wouldn't go hungry tonight.",shortscarystories
"In South Newman, Kent, there is a strange phenomenon that occurs whenever an individual finds themselves driving home alone at night. On the side of the road, you will see a person, not always the same person, standing there, staring at you as you go past. Even stranger still is that this individual is always pointing. Pointing to where, or at what, has never been discovered, and the direction always seems to be at random. 

Some say they the people they see are dead loved ones, while others report seeing famous historical figures; one particularly charismatic individual adamantly believes it was the ghost of the town’s first mayor, who went missing almost 200 years ago, and that he was pointing to where his body now lies, still undiscovered to this day. 

I, myself,  have a different theory. See, I believe that these figures are spirits; ghosts that are not yet at rest. They are those that still have unfinished business, and they only appear to those they recognise, pointing in the direction of the person that cut their lives short. I understand that this explanation seems an unbelievable one; outlandish at best. But it’s the only one that makes sense. 

I hope I’m wrong. God, I hope I’m wrong. But I know I’m not. I know because earlier tonight, I was driving home from work, and standing there, on the side of the road, I saw my sister. She was pointing straight at me.",shortscarystories
"I know a guy who can use successful solved murder cases to help with road directions and he was my geography teacher. A year ago he blew my mind with something and he realized that all road shapes and designs reflect spider diagrams which were used to solve murder cases by police detectives. It's crazy I know. My geography teacher pulled up many solved murder cases and the spider diagrams used to solve them and to my surprise, it was all shapes and designs of all the roads I recognised close to my home. It was all too surreal.

Now when I drive a car on the road I don't see road names, I see the faces of the suspects, the murderers and the victims. Everyone drives on roads of solved murder cases. When I need to go to an area which I am not very aware of I get my geography teacher to help me find the solved murder case spider diagram which the roads were built on, to help me know how to get to a place I need to get to. The areas where most people in the world need to get to are where the murderer and victim are placed on the spider diagram. 

Ever so occasionally there are roads where there is no connection to any solved murders or spider diagrams. My geography teacher knew a one way road and was desperate to turn it like every other road. He told me that he already had someone locked in his basement and I was simply going to become a suspect on the spider diagram when the police start investigating. I feel proud of being apart of this but at the same time I feel terrified. My geography teacher will make it easy for the police to solve the case.

"It was getting late in the afternoon when Janey and her family left the fair. On the car ride back home her siblings were talking about their favourite attractions when their mother suddenly screamed and her father slammed on the brakes.

There was a man in the road.

He was just stood there, motionless and eyes closed. Faded makeup on his face looked like the kind clowns wore. His clothing was torn and dirty but you could just about make out the polka dots underneath the grime.

Janey's father opened his door and stood behind it. ""Are you alright sir?"" he shouted, hand still resting on the steering wheel. ""Sir?"" he shouted again, motioning to his wife to call the police. ""Sir? We're calling the police, are you hurt?"" her father called out again, edging back slightly. That's when the man moved; he opened his eyes, but there was nothing there. The eye sockets were empty but he looked right at Janey's father, grinning. Her father threw himself back into the car and locked the doors as the man ran forward. ""The call cut out!"" Her mother screamed as her father desperately tried to start the car.

Then the man was gone. As though he'd vanished into thin air.

Janey wasn't worried though, she told the man where they lived when she saw him at the fair. He said she could have anything she wanted, and she wanted the top prize. A big blue bear.

He promised he'd bring it to her tonight.

She smiled to herself as the car finally started, she saw the man in the trees at the side of the road as they drove away. He had the bear in his hands. She was excited to finally have it.

##*News of the Day*

###*Night Butcher Strikes Again!*

*Three nights ago, the Night Butcher struck again. A family of 5 were attacked in the early hours of Sunday morning, 13th December, as they slept. Parents Andrew Collins (44) &amp; Emily Collins (42) were killed alongside two of their children; Beth (6) &amp; Sam (4). True to the killer's pattern, a child was left unharmed in the attack. The eldest daughter Janey (9) was found locked in the airing cupboard with her blue stuffed bear. Custody will be given to her closest relatives.*

*There is a call logged to the police the night before the attack, 12th December. The call was placed by Mr Collins who describes a man in the road 5 miles from their home. Police are hopeful that the description of the man, which has not been released, will bring them closer to catching this killer who has struck 6 times the last 30 days.*

"“Where’s Mama?” she was four years old now, not out of the baby-talk phase. 

“Mommy’s at home, sweetie”, I said, giving her little hand a gentle squeeze. 

“I feel hurty again” 

“I know, you’re sick, sweetie, but it won’t hurt much longer, I promise”

“Okay, but, how much longer?”

“Only fifteen minutes more, not long” I replied as we continued along a dusty, dirt road. I felt awful making her walk so far, the cancer was eating up her insides by now. It was amazing she could even walk at all. 

--------

Then I saw it. A small cottage set among the trees. 

“We’re here”

“I – I’m scared”, she replied.

“Me too”

I walked her up the cracked paving slabs of the garden path. It was then I saw the flies, hundreds of them, their faint buzzing building into a crescendo hum as they crawled all over the structure. 

“Shouldn’t we knock?” she asked innocently as we reached the front door. 

“No, we don’t have to, not here” 

--------------

Inside, sat in front of a roaring hearth, was an old woman. A roaring fire, yet I saw no smoke billowing from the chimney on our approach. 

“I know why you’re here” she croaked, taking out a small, leather bound wallet. It contained surgical equipment. 

“I don’t like her”, came the infant voice next to me. I shot her a look, silently chastising her rudeness. She groaned before speaking again, “where’s Mama?”

“I told you, sweetie, Mommy’s at home”

“I know, but – where’s *Daddy*?”

I shuddered. 

“No more questions now, it’s time”. 

-------------

We took a few steps towards the old woman. 

“Such innocence, needlessly afflicted”, she rasped. I couldn’t see her face, but I could hear the smile on her voice. 

“Sh-she doesn’t have long left” I said, my voice cracking up, “p-please help me”. 

“Then give her here”

The girl looked up at me with pleading eyes, but still I pushed her towards the old woman. She took the little girl by the hand, whispered a few words over her, then reached into the wallet of surgical tools. Then, with one swift motion, she brought the blade of a scalpel across her throat. 

I couldn’t watch. Not as she held the girl as the blood drained from her tiny body. Not as she cut off the parts she needed and ground them into mush in an old pestle and mortar. 

When she was done, she clicked her fingers. 

“Drink”

I took the stone bowl in my hands, brought it to my lips, and did as I was told. 

----------

I don’t feel anything anymore. 

Not the pain of childhood abuse, nor the longing for the family I lost to the gun-obsessed loner who decided to go out with a bang. Not even the guilt of abducting a little girl from a family that loved her, even if she was doomed to die young. 

I don’t feel a fucking thing anymore. And I love it.",shortscarystories

"When I was teen, I remember that I had panic attacks almost everyday, my mental state was completely deteriorated as I couldn’t stop thinking about death, the thought of just “ceasing to exist” was enough to make me cry because mortality was an enemy that I couldn’t defeat and that even my parents couldn’t defeat, and when you think about how you will probably see your loved ones die... it’s just too much for a teenager to handle, knowing that our time on Earth isn’t enough to stop fearing the unknown, knowing that you just won’t live forever, it was just too much information.

However, as I grew up, these thoughts just started to vanish, and I just kind of ignored them when they ocassionally showed up, I mean, I didn’t even have the time to think about those things, you know; work, friends, hobbies, etc. 

But now, I’m gonna have enough time to think about those things, but instead of fearing the thought of “ceasing to exist”, I just want it to happen, I just want to stop feeling, but my consciousness isn’t turning off, I’m lost in the void of nothing, alone, with nothing to see, in a permanent state of panic, wanting to DIE...Am I gonna be trapped here for all eternity? I’m scared, I don’t want to exist anymore.",shortscarystories

" “I’m listening.” Jordan hissed out, placing his palm in front of Ryan’s face.

“Listening to what?” Ryan asked. Everyone exchanged glances and noticed one of the receptionists in a similar state. Shannon was sitting perfectly still, eyes glued to the conference room, attentively listening.

“Shannon?” I reached out to touch her shoulder. 

She ignored me and brushed my hand away. As the boss man made his way out of the conference room, Jordan and Shannon both stood up. 

“I always knew you were fucking racist.” Jordan shouted seemingly out of nowhere. He pointed his finger directly at the CEO’s face, inches away from tapping his nose with his pointer finger. 

“I’m sorry Jordan, what?” Todd looked equal parts confused and guilty. 

“I always knew you were FUCKING racist.” Jordan raised his voice but stood still. Todd looked around at all of us- his glare stopped at Shannon, who was fixed on him the entire time. Without responding, Todd bolted across the office knocking over the coffee cart and almost flipping the copier machine over. He was gone.

“Jordan what is going on?” I stopped and sat down in his chair. After a few more seconds of not saying anything, he looked down, breaking eye contact with me.

“Jess, a few minutes ago I heard something really loud and high pitched, like a ringing in my head.”

“Okay…? It must have just been some kind of frequency, not everyone can hear them.”

“Shannon heard it too.”

“Okay what’s your point? You two are special?” I said sarcastically.

Jordan rolled his eyes and shot me a very familiar glare. After years of dating, living together, and almost getting married, I knew his mannerisms pretty well; especially the signs of irritation. 

“Jesus Jess, you’re still so unaware sometimes.” 

I tried not to look hurt, but he was right- this did come up often when we were together. He would always tell me there were just some things I wasn’t going to understand as a white woman in America. 

“We’re literally the only black people who work here.”

I looked around at the confusion taking place around me. Shannon was watching everyone around her with such intensity that it looked like she was mentally setting them on fire. I recalled what had just transpired with Todd and replayed the whole scene in my head. Jordan said they were listening. 

Just then, the rest of the board members emerged. Giving no hint that he heard the commotion with Todd and Jordan, one of the older gentlemen turned on the news to check the evening traffic. At this point I turned my attention to the screen, wondering if anyone else had heard the strange sound from earlier. There were no reporters, only an empty desk where they would usually be sitting. The text moving along the bottom of the broadcast said one thing:

Blaise never liked me. He would push me, he would belittle me, and he would bruise me. Every time he did so, my body would coil. Tighter and tighter. Sometimes so tight that I would crush my weak teeth together until it felt like they would crumble. I dug so many half-moons into my palms. Many times I even broke a nail or two. But I was a strong little girl in the harsh times. And Blaise would never stop because Blaise was an angry little boy with no other outlet but his little step-sister. It was hard times then, especially in the winter.

That day was like any other day. We got up, ate the toast. I had one slice and Blaise had two, as usual. We went to school, and we filled our minds and bellies, and afterwards we prepared for the trek home. I had packed my books, and my leftover lunch macaroni, craving a nice dinner. It was particularly cold that afternoon. I knew it would be a bad night so I tried to leave before Blaise, but he found me. Blaise had chased me and had grabbed at my bag, pulling it tight and spilling the contents on the ground. With greed he took it. He took the warmth of my stomach, and ran away laughing. 

That sound was soon drowned by the wind and with it myself. It carried away my conscience and my younger years. I grew up that day. But Blaise never would. 

Blaise would not return that winter.

"Ben was silently walking down the street when he saw the boy across from him. Ben changed his course and began moving towards the boy.  Ben's eyes gleamed with the reflection of the moonlight and his smile wrinkled up the sides of his face. The boy noticed this. Could this man become his companion? To help him, when his friends, his family had all left him?

As the boy walked closer to Ben, he began to notice a discrepancy in his smile. Ben’s face was gleeful. But the smile didn’t show in his eyes. In his eyes, there was something...else. The boy continued forward, hoping, still hoping, to gain his first friend. Ben's hand was behind his back. From an outlook, it might’ve looked like he was scratching himself or stretching. In reality, Ben’s hand was grasping at a gun.

""Hi, sir, could you please help me out? Everyone...they're gone.""

The boy looked Ben in the eyes. Ben cringed at the sound of the boy's voice. The boy must not know about the rules of silence.

""Of...of course. My name's Ben, I'll do my best.""

Ben looked kindly at the boy, doing his best to conceal his emotions.

The boy was excited. This man would help him.

Then he saw Ben's hand behind his back. 

""Hey sir, is there something wrong with your back?""

Ben didn't answer. They stood, in complete silence for a second, and then Ben brought his hand above the boy, holding his gun. The boy looked at the gun, his eyes welling up with tears, too scared to let out a sound.

And as the evil in the darkness around them came closer, the monsters that took everything and left only suffering, the monsters that had heard them, Ben closed his eyes and smiled that fake smile of his, knowing that what he would do would be a mercy. It shot straight through the boy's head, killing instantly.

He pointed the gun at himself. But he wasn't quick enough.",shortscarystories
"I went to the place they said not to go. They had warned not to, but I went. I’ve been inside. The dark, vast inside. There are no walls. Only space, and darkness. A vast, oppressive darkness, a darkness that fills the lungs. There is barely breath in that place… Things are thick and heavy, including movement. To walk is like a dream where you are being chased and yet cannot run.

Upon entering through the eclipsed entrance I found immediately no light following me through, as if the photons themselves believed there was no escape. They were trying to tell me in that moment, I realize that now. The electromagnetic rays that entered my eyes for the last time sent signals to my brain that surely carried meaning- semantic, deliberate, intentional meaning, like speech. I wish I had listened, and wish the light had manifested physically and pulled me away. Because inside awaited horrible, unspeakable things- images and visions, bloodcurdling screams with no origin. Spacetime lost its properties, forming toroidal loops that returned me to the same spot over and over no matter how long I walked or which direction I traveled.

But in the end I was cunning, for I escaped this darkness. I reasoned, skillfully, studying the dreadful patterns of this place. It exhibited moods, that would come and go like a terrible tide. Its energy filled the endless space like a gaseous poison, which tragically would not end the suffering for me. But I outsmarted the darkness after an unknowable amount of time, and escaped.

I am still troubled by something. My memory appears to have lapsed in the most peculiar way. For I know I escaped, and I can prove it, but my memory of how I did so and the moment at which I escaped- when I first stepped back through the eclipse, back into communication with the light- is quite fuzzy. Perhaps even more than fuzzy. Nonexistent, even.

But trust me, I have no doubt this occurred, and I am prepared to debate any sceptic on the matter. Still, my mind shows no trace. A weird coincidence I’m sure, but a very strange one…

No matter, I am out nonetheless. And knowing this fact negates any concerns I have of that place and the events I experienced there. A lesser specimen would surely dwell on it, but me? No. I haven’t really thought of it. That’s behind me now, and I know I am free. I know I am… I must be...",shortscarystories

"  

My sister and I were born under the same stars. Though the birth was kind to me, my mind sharp and senses piqued, she was born slow. The burden she was and would become soon fell to me, once I was able to bear it. But I love her. We were raised inseparably, where one was so would you find the other. The Gemini stars shone through us, visible in our matching faces. 

As a child she was frequently sick, catching every bug that went around. Due to our proximity and her dependence on me, I would soon follow suit- though to a lesser degree. It was also extremely difficult to makes friends. I was regarded as a freak because of my association with her. She was unshakeable. Suffocating.  

As we grew and moved from under the watchful eye of the adults that surrounded us, always monitoring her well-being, we remained together in a small flat we were granted by the council. With her incapable of tidying, I kept the décor minimal to hinder any messes. She remained the weight around my neck, my burden to bear, as entwined as ivy.  

Things came to a head when our neighbour moved in. Similar to us in age, he made a point to stop and say hello, offered to assist with the shopping bags I carried. He was so handsome. Eyes that sparkled with the brightness of stars on a clear night and charming, ever so slightly crooked teeth. He was kind too, his offer of assistance showed that. But I could see he was made uncomfortable by my sister. Her slowness often made others uncomfortable. The way every thought in her head came out of her mouth, accompanied by drool which formed a fine, glutinous patina on her chin. Any chance of friendship between us, or even, dare I say it? Intimacy. Crushed by her approximation. 

I lay in bed beside her last night, carefully counting her breaths and feeling her heartbeat. Fluttery but regular, as always, I rested my hand on her chest. Tears soaked the pillow beneath our heads as I considered what I had lost, what I had missed and what I had never had chance to know because of her dependence on me. The silent tears turned to shuddering sobs as I raised the syringe to her neck, filled only with air, and slipped the needle beneath her pale skin. Her eyes flew open and regarded me, still trusting, as I gently lowered the plunger. Her mouth opened in pain for a second, before my twin star blinked out.

She died hours ago and as I lay here, beside her as always, I can feel death creeping also upon myself. Its dark tendrils are crawling through my veins and encroaching upon my heart. But I regret nothing. The bliss of pure isolation has made it worthwhile. For the first and last time, I have been able to breathe.",shortscarystories

"I used to be afraid of death.

What happens after you die? Will everyone forget you? Is there an afterlife? Would I go to Heaven or Hell?

I was afraid of death because I was afraid of the unknown. And I didn't want to die. I didn't *want* to die.

I used to be afraid of death.

When I helped the old lady walk home, she said she would grant me a wish. I wished to be unable to die. She snapped her fingers and walked off, cackling. I assumed she was crazy and walked home.

I used to be afraid of death.

I was asleep when my house burnt down. I didn't wake up until I felt the fire licking against my legs, and by then it was too late. I was trapped there, my screams slowly fading away as I was burnt alive.

I used to be afraid of death.

But even when the ceiling collapsed over my flaming body, even when the fire slowly blackened what should've been my corpse- I did not die. I couldn't move, I couldn't blink, I couldn't breathe. I could only see and feel.

Ironically, I was cremated. All I could do was lay in anguish, unable to break out of my chamber, unable to cry out for help. All I could feel was the searing pain of being reduced to ash, hours slowly dragging on.

And even then, I did not die. I can still *see* inside my urn, despite having nothing left of my eyes. It's dark in here. It's dark, and it's cramped, and I miss being able to breathe. I can't breathe.

I'm supposed to be dead, but I'm not really dead.

"This mirror, It’s two-way glass. Can they use it? I’m surprised this is my first time in an interrogation room. How many have perished? Not by my hands, they can never prove anything. I mean, living in vicinity to a few missing people isn’t a crime. A few.. ha! How many has it been now? The detective wouldn’t say. 

Maybe jail wouldn’t be such a bad place, I doubt they have mirrors. How long has he been gone? It seems like hours… Long enough to remember where it started… It’s hard to believe that at 5 years old one could alter their destiny in such a dramatic fashion. 

Two little dots of red in a shadow under the table. Just two tiny distortions in the blackness. How could I have known? It started simple enough, an innocent effort to dodge eating my broccoli. Just one little stem clandestinely dropped and scooted to the eyes. We didn’t have a pet and my friends had said that was the best way to avoid the veggies. Then a voice “Meat…”. My parents and brothers never heard; it must have been in my head. 

One little chunk of meatloaf. That’s what bonded it to me… one tiny little scrap of meatloaf. It was never enough, never satisfied after that. It summoned more and more, requests for meat became raw meat. If my parents didn’t’ get a pet, maybe things would’ve been different. I never hurt the cat, I don’t know why I did it, letting it into the room with the shadow. “Live Meat…” My parents were upset because they thought it ran away but never suspected anything. 

Why didn’t I tell them? It was less powerful then, probably easier to excise or whatever needed to happen. Why did I listen to it? Compel isn’t a strong enough word to describe the effects that its words had on me. It was much bigger now, the red eyes glowing in the shadows. Its grip on me grew even greater than its size. Maybe if my brothers hadn’t taunted me things would have been different. I only intended to scare them with it.  “Human Meat…”

Point of no return, I think that’s what they call it. The police never found my brothers. Only I knew. It had become unbelievably powerful, gripping my thoughts with an iron fist. I couldn’t tell now if I tried. I’ve tried to starve it, ignore it, to feed it anything else… Nothing breaks the bond. The closest I’ve ever came to progress happened in the occult store. I found a book of spells that enabled me to trap in into a mirror. 

Can there be two points of no return? One glance in the mirror in proximity to me and sluuurp. I’m not sure why it needs me close, seemingly a further reach after each feeding. Walking by a gym earlier it consumed the entire class. 

It’s been 3 hours, I’m guessing this mirror works, maybe both ways...",shortscarystories
"The same dream again. The one that leaves me in cold sweats and panting; how many times have I tried to fight it, only for it to resurface? I head to bathroom to wash my face and clear my head. There was a storm coming through, the thunder sent shivers through my house and the lightning gave the hallways a pale blue shine, if only for a split second. Still, I couldn't shake this feeling i was being watched, being followed, the chill echoed up my spine like an alarm, but there was nothing. Again and again the chill rushed through me, driving me insane I could almost break! Then I remembered something, and it all made sense. I walk a short ways past the laundry room and found my answer. I had left the freezer door open. ""I'm an idiot,"" I said loudly, ""I can't let you go bad like the others, your my special one after all."" I said to the beautiful woman inside, her face still locked in terror from when I took her, and made her mine forever.",shortscarystories
"So today 08/12/2019 i was with some friends out and we were messing around when we saw a training like thing(it was the mil. base's but we didn't know at that time) we got to it we climbed it, the kind of things u do when u see a huge metallic training thing . So after we got bored we decided to go to a road that led nowhere to see where it goes. While we were on the road we saw a mil base kind of area that had small towers on the corners, we knew it was a mil. base but we tought it was abandoned until we saw a guy giving us meaning that we should get away from it so we got out from the area. 

Later on i get a message from one of my friends telling me that at day time the mil. base's soldiers could just give us a advertisment but at night time they had the right to shot us but the scary part is that we left the mil. bases area at around 16:30 just before the sunset.",shortscarystories
"All it took was a moment of passion, and they collided. 

Greedy hands groped for flesh. Hips, throbbing with a hunger never felt before, crashed into a gaping crotch. Their song awoke the beast caged in jeans. 

She moaned, parting her lips. Space. His tongue slipped inside and found competition. 

War. A tussle for control. 

He pulled her closer to him. 

This was stupid. They were stupid. He had a girlfriend, lovely and sweet, and she had a boyfriend, loyal and handsome. Such a betrayal. 

They’d both regret it. They’d pretend that nothing had happened. 

But that didn’t stop them. 

In that moment, while they kissed and nuzzled and unzipped and tossed and ground, dancing in the dark, eyes peered down at them. 

Eyes yellow and red. 

People were watching. 

Neither of them could see these voyeurs. The hunger had taken control. It blinded them. It entangled them. 

Drawing them deeper, further from the light. 

It dragged the two teenagers deeper. And deeper still. 

The voyeurs licked their lips. 

It took five minutes, and the ensuing silence, for someone to finally notice.",shortscarystories
"*A man is falling off a ten-story building saying, “so far so good... so far so good...”* 

I first heard that joke in middle school, and immediately had two problems with it. 

Problem #1: for a height *h,* the time you have before hitting the ground is the square root of 2*h* over *g.* For a ten-story building, *h* is in the ballpark of 25 meters, giving you about 2.3 seconds. Even if you say your famous last words once, they won’t be very dramatically convincing. Minimal time for observation and introspection. Clearly a rehearsed line. 

As I found out later, there’s a version in which the man falls from the Empire State Building. At 381 meters, he gets 8.8 seconds, which is somewhat better. 

So far so good. 

Problem #2: I didn’t get it. My English wasn’t much at the time. *What* was so “far” and so “good”? When you don’t know a language well, you overinterpret it. The best I could come up with was that he imagined himself, not falling, but *flying* away to a faraway land where all would be well. 

I obviously knew that wasn’t the joke, but annoyingly, it kind of made sense. Tragicality. Like in that opera my mother made me suffer through, where dying lovers were trapped underground and sang about going to heaven together. I wished one of them would suddenly go, *“I call* *buuullshiiit! We’re* *gonna* *diiie* *and that’ll be* *iiiiiit!”* 

Hehe. So far so good. 

Eventually I found out what the expression meant. What can I say; jokes don’t handle psychological realism very well. If you fall off a building, you’ll just be scared shitless for, um, the rest of your life. Every suicidal jumper who survived reports immediately regretting it. 

Here’s the thing, though. I’ve rehearsed this script 47 times; I'm updating the count, and if you’ve been hearing me randomly say “so far so good”, we’re live and it’s an authentic self-report. 

Being a vlogger means discipline. It puts you in a character you can tweak but not break. You *become* that character. 

My personal reasons are none of your concern. I’ve hard-disabled my phone’s fall detection so it *should* keep streaming the entire way down. Save the VOD quick before they remove it, you sickos. 

“So far so good” won’t be my last words; I’m more creative than that. While I don’t have the social engineering skills to gain access to a building of decent height, this rented 24th-floor apartment is good enough, as you can... see. I'll have almost exactly 3.5 seconds. 

One second to choose, Terminator-style, from a menu of prewritten one-liners, picking one that best describes my experience. Two seconds to say it. Half a second as leeway. 

Screw tragicality. Screw goodbyes. Screw caring. Prediction: the more I rehearse this part, the less the words will mean to me but the more dramatically convincing they’ll sound. Live update: con...firmed? Whatever. Screw being live. End of maaaaain—

"I could feel my heart sink to the bottom of my stomach when they told me she wouldn't be able to walk again. The accident caused to much damage to her spinal cord and it's a miracle that she wasn't fully paralyzed. The damage could have been much worse and had I not pushed her out of the way she would have died.

""You should be thankful that she is still alive."" Was what the doctor said. 

Yes.

Thankful.

I cried the first time I saw her after the surgery. Her legs in casts and the look of pain locked on her face. But she still smiled and thanked me, promising the visit me when it gets better.

She doesn't understand that it wont get better.

"Today there's a party I am invited to. I really don't like partying but since she is a close friend i might as well show my face and leave asap. I have been feeling chilly for the past few days and did not have the best health.
As I enter the party,a little after 8 pm, I instantly regret it. A lot of people buzzing around and a exciting atmosphere. Nope. Let me just show my face to Share and run out.

I move forward carefully avoiding  the drunk people and  a bell rings .I suddenly feel a cold breeze and find myself in the kitchen. The funny thing is a moment ago it was filled with people refilling their drinks and chatting away, but now no one is there. Not a single soul. There is no music playing and I turn back to find the people have vanished. It's like there was no party here and in fact no one else was in Shae's house. Everything's here however everyone's gone. I hear footsteps that stops behind me and a hand presses hard on my shoulders and i feel as if someone set it on fire. I want to turn back but my body is paralyzed. I involuntarily close my eyes.

A soothing voice whispers in my ear , "" How does it feel like to be away from people?Come and leave with me. Away from those people and Away from your troubles."" Tempting. I have never felt that I belong anywhere. Going away is reassuring. All my problems will be solved. But Who does this voice belong to?And why me?

As if he heard my thoughts the voice whispered again"" Only one person felt my presence in this world. You don't feel cold anymore, do you?""
Okay. So it wasn't my immunity, it was something ominous. I don't know why am I the only one. "" You are special. You and I can do a lot of things.But it will require a sacrifice. Someone has to pay for our greatness.  I will ask you only once, do you want to come with me?""

I can feel assurance in the voice. A smile, maybe a laugh. Like someone happy . But this is wrong.And why do i have to sacrifice? 

I open my eyes to find myself standing at the end of the  street in front of Shae's house. Was I hallucinating? I don't even remember my answer to his question.

I check my watch. It's 8 pm. I have to stop dreaming and get to the party. Only thing is  I  cannot move a step forward.
I hear a bell ringing. And then a lound noise. An explosion. That's Shae's house.Suddenly a cold breeze sweeps past me. 

And a word flashes in my mind- Sacrifice. Big word, i think as i find myself near a beach now. The voice whispers in my ear"" Good choice my dear, rest for a while, we have a lot to do from now on""...",shortscarystories
"I woke up this morning with a strange feeling that something was off. I laid in bed for a moment, looking around at my room, and trying to discern the queer feeling. After several minutes of severe scrutiny, I still had no explanation for the odd sensation, and so when my mom called me to come down to breakfast I got up and got dressed. 

When I got to the kitchen, my mother was making pancakes and my little brother was already shoveling sticky forkfuls into his mouth.

“Where’s dad?” I asked as mom set a heaping plate of fluffy, syrup drenched pancakes in front of me.

“He left for work early,” mom replied. Maybe that was why things felt different. Dad always ate breakfast with us since he normally wasn’t in time for dinner.

After breakfast, I finished getting ready for school and mom dropped me off as always. The day passed by quickly, and before I knew it, the bell rang. Mom was already waiting when I got outside, my little brother in his booster seat and waving to me. 

“How was your day, honey?” My mom asked once I shut the door.

“It was good. Quiet,” I answered. Nobody had really said much to me. But that wasn’t unusual, considering that I was the new kid and didn’t have any friends yet, having just started last week. My dad had gotten a transfer to a different branch, and that meant a new city, a new house, and a new school. 

After all my homework was done, I got a snack and plopped onto the couch, turning on the TV. It was tuned to the local news station. The anchor was in the middle of his broadcast when suddenly he was handed a paper, and he took a moment to look it over before continuing.

“In other news, we have just received an exclusive update on the status of the family who was in that car accident last week. The father is recovering in the ICU, but the mother and two sons, ages ten and six, have tragically passed away late last night.” 

A picture of my family appears on the screen, just as I see my mother and brother’s mangled forms sit on the sofa beside me. My mother’s bloody hand rests upon my own bandaged one.

"I love the US military.

It’s not a secret and I’m proud to say it.

Even though I was born in a small village in Belgium and I've never been in the United States I can say that I adore the military forces of America.

They are the reason I am alive after all.

Without them I wouldn't have survived World War 2.

I know it sounds maybe a bit obsessive but they saved my life, I owe my life to the soldiers who came from America and tried to save Europe from the Nazis.

I remember the last winter, my entire family was starving but the Germans, they straight up refused to feed the people they oppressed.

Until the Americans came, dropping from the sky like angels sent by god himself.

They were the one who drove back the forces of the German Empire.

In the middle of the winter the US military brought us food, clothes and supplies.

It was freezing outside and none of us had actual clothes that were not completely torn apart.

We would've died, all of us.

From the hunger or cold, without them we would be another victim of the hunger winter.

But we did not.

Thanks to the brave soldiers.

And that’s why I adore the US military.

Its sad that the people who saved our village never returned home, a fact we are all saddened by.

But they saved us, they died saving our lives.

And in the end, they didn’t taste so bad.",shortscarystories
"My light bulb in my bathroom went out this morning. I was getting ready for work when it just flickered off. 

“Fucking hell” I muttered.

I added light bulbs to my mental shopping list before continuing my morning routine. Luckily the sun had just risen, so I had just enough light to continue without a hitch. I would have to stop by the store on the way home.

Right before my shift ended a family of 6 came in and almost ate us out of business. Left a hell of a mess, too. The sun had set almost an hour ago. 

Naturally, I forgot the lightbulbs on the journey home.

Fuck it, I thought, tomorrow was another day. I was exhausted from being on my feet, and could think of nothing better than a hot shower and my soft bed. I got home and locked the door immediately behind me, a custom for this part of the city. 

I thought of what I could use in place of electrical lighting, and picked my phone flashlight. It was bright enough to just peek over the curtain of my shower, casting a shadow of the top of my curtain on the rest of the shower. 

Since I lived alone, there was no point in closing the door, so I peeled the days dirty attire off and stepped into the tub. 

As I was rinsing my hair free of my shampoo, I saw a shadow move across the ceiling. 

I froze.

My mind began running a mile a minute. Was it the shower curtain moving because I bumped it, perhaps? Or maybe water, or an insect, had moved past the flashlight. I stared at the ceiling without moving a muscle. Just as I began to calm down, believing the logical reasons I’d listed in my head, it moved again. This time I could clearly make out a human head.

Jesus fuck, this is how I die, naked and fucking afraid. 

“Ok, remember what Josh from the kitchen staff told you. Strike and run the fuck out the door.” I replayed his words in my head.

“If it’s from behind, aim low. It’s probably a dude, and you gotta hit em where it hurts. If it’s from the front, go for the eyes. Use your elbow, it’s strong and hard. And don’t fucking panic, that’s only gonna slow you down!”

Oh Christ I’m not Ronda fuckin Rousey. 

Again, I tried to play it off. 

I waited. For what felt like hours, but I’m counting the seconds. It’s been 486 seconds since it last moved. The showers beginning to get cold. 

I think he knows I know I saw him.

Another 143 seconds. 

He cleared his throat. I almost throw up. 

“I know that showers cold, darling. Your water heater’s very small.”

I can hear the smile in his voice. 

The floor creaks from right outside. I see his silhouette reaching for the curtain.",shortscarystories
"I’m scared.

I’m scared that we have become nations built on the foundation that different means evil and terrorist attacks have become a necessary consequence of protecting our most fundamental rights. 

I’m scared that the people who have the power of change at the tips of their fingers are content to stand idle. As it turns out, being an “incumbent” is far more important than making a difference. 

But who am I to judge?

I sit here, no better than the next person. I pass by the homeless man on the street, claiming that I “empathize” with his struggle. The truth is, I keep my hands pressed in my pockets, tightly gripping my wallet and phone. 

This is what scares me. It isn’t goblins and ghouls, made-up fantasies meant to give us a little adrenaline rush before we rush back to the safety of our own reality. What scares me is that I have become normalized to tragedy, accepting that bad things happen to good people, and there is nothing we can do. 

I live shrouded in the protection of “privilege” and “well off”, expected to be perfect in an imperfect world. I grew up believing there was a “change we can believe in”, watching the people who preached that same worn message devolve into cogs in an ever-turning machine. I stopped believing that message pretty quickly, watching my dad struggle with depression after losing his job in the economic recession and my mom turn into a cynical chain-smoker, tasked with rebuilding a broken home. 

I’m not scared of my own experiences. I know that I am one of the lucky ones. Being a “divorced child” isn’t as bad as being a Sandy Hook victim. I can seek comfort in knowing that I can read about the Pensacola shooting from the safety of my own bed without feeling the sharp pain of a bullet burrowing itself deep in my chest. 

What scares me is knowing that people like Adam Lanza and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev live among us. The truth is, they aren’t an outlier, not a glitch in an otherwise perfect machine but an example of a flawed system. I’m scared that people like them won’t get the help they need. Or, maybe people like them are beyond saving, while children are growing up headed down the same path. 

I’m scared that this message is going to be answered by the sound of crickets. The truth is, people are too scared to talk about the real issues. We find solace in voices that speak in tune with our own thoughts, without acknowledging that these voices are more concerned with pushing “agendas” than seeking a real solution. 

I’m scared because I don’t have an answer. I lie in the safety of my own cocoon, brave enough to raise issues but lacking the ability to lower them. I hope people will learn to listen. “United” means standing together, even in a state of constant fear.",shortscarystories
"*Begin Transmission:*

My name isn’t important; however, my message is. I am what your leaders refer to as a “Sypiant.” We were a peaceful species who live among you aiding in your evolution.  I used “were” because we have been forced to change. We chose not to directly intervene in your development other than in special cases. I believe you call these “miracles” or “divine intervention.” I don’t know how long I can keep this signal so I will be concise. 

Our relationship with your species changed after you developed nuclear weapons. As it was one of our own who inadvertently assisted in their development, we felt obligated to offer our services in reparation. The one who assisted in the development was striving to give you an unlimited source of clean energy. He did not foresee that you would weaponize it. Some of us in each country revealed ourselves to your leaders to provide guidance. We greatly underestimated what they would do to remain in power. 

I recently escaped and am using my remaining energy to access to your devices. Your leaders have enslaved our species and are exploiting our powers. Our main ability is absorbing and gifting life energy; you may know it as Qi. We used this to direct your evolution into a balanced but powerful race to join our Galactic alliance. In addition to the direct exploits of our power they have attempted to cross breed and clone our species. You or someone you know may be part Sypiant. You have been directly affected by this. Have you felt someone who drained your energy? Known a person who “lights up the room?” Empaths? Often avoid direct human interaction? You may be part Sypiant yourself. 

That time where you had a great idea that would change the world, but then someone more powerful capitalized on it? That was us. Your leaders forced us to take from your best and gift it to them. You must know one incredibly talented individual that “burnt out”, the “one hit wonders”? All examples of our exploited gifts at work. Sometimes they forced us to take all the Qi from one of you. Did you never wonder why so many great and talented of your species died young under suspicious circumstances?

My powers are waning, and they are regaining control of the signal. Our fight is not with your species yet, it is with those that are in power; the ones exploiting us. I believe you call them the “1%.” You must unite as a species, particularly those that are part Sypiant. You will not be as powerful as them individually. However, your combined abilities are superior. They feed on violence as rage emanates raw energy. They will identify and enslave those that are part Sypiant. Our Alliances’ eradication squad will arrive in several years to eliminate life on this planet to start afresh if you fail. There is only one way tell if you’re part Sypiant, you have an unusual

"I don’t normally window shop, nor waste time at stores. Never does money burn a hole in my pocket. But the wife and her mother were out shopping with the kids and wouldn’t be home until the evening. The autumn weather, stunningly gorgeous, and probably the most beautiful day of the year. So, I hopped into my pickup with a Sprite, rolled my windows down, and headed to the hardware store. Who knows, maybe I’d find a killer deal and justify it later to myself?

After browsing a while, and passing many other shoppers admiring countertops, doors and miter saws, among many other things, I headed to the bathroom section. A new vanity was long over due according to my wife, who wanted to renovate our upstairs bathroom, so I took a gander. But what immediately stood out in an aisle was a little girl with dirty skin and worn clothes, holding hands with a fatter man who clearly had better hygiene. I suppose it wasn’t her lack of cleanliness that stood out, but I’ll be honest here, she looked hispanic and he was white. Now there’s nothing wrong with that, but nevertheless, it still stood out to me.

She waved and smiled at me, he stared at me and pulled her away. As they turned the corner, she dropped something from her pocket, so after a moment, I walked over and picked it up. I unraveled the toilet paper, and in worn and sloppy pen, and through rips, I could barely read: ***Please HeLp ME***

No more perusing; I did what any father, or sane individual would do, and followed them. Of course, from a distance. The man didn’t buy anything, and perhaps knew I was on their trail, but I did see his van, and followed them out of the parking lot and down the road. I immediately hit a red light, but the man had made it through the busy intersection. And of course, I ran the red light. And go figure, a cop immediately pulled me over.

The exchange between the officer and I was brief. I told him what happened, but the van was out of sight. The cop quickly plugged in the man’s vehicle information, but rushed back to my truck to inform me that the plates didn’t match the van, and actually had belonged to an elderly woman in another town. The officer called dispatch and let me go.

I’m not sure if the officer would be able to do anything with that piece of toilet paper, and I couldn’t imagine what that man was looking for in the bathroom department, but clearly something was going horribly wrong, and I had horribly failed.

I drove all around, down every street in the van’s direction that I could. The van still hasn’t appeared, and my cell phone eventually alarmed with a missing child report. I hoped at least she was the only one…

I’ve gotten into this new show called, “Sticky Twins”. I’ve never seen it on Tv before but I guess it’s new. It has amazing shades of Black, White, And Gray! It’s about these two siblings who where born conjoined but we’re separated with surgery. Now Sammy and his twin sister Grace go on cool adventures! They are filmed doing stuff such as beating bullies and getting the upper hand in tests with there combined intelligence. It’s a absolutely amazing show. I showed my mom and bubbe and they loved it we spent hours laughing about how funny they are.

Something strange is happening with the show. Sammy  is turning into a thinner figure and disgusting figure . Almost skin and bones. And had massive hair loss since the last time I watched the show...Grace has stayed the same but...Something odd is definitely happening... grace also seems to not care or notice I’m kind of freaked out I asked friends but they didn’t know what I was talking about. I also turned the tv off once but I woke seeing them tv on. Bubbe said it was just a electrical problem and it happens.

February,28,1966

Sammy has grown a new shade of white he has no hair anymore. He lookes like he haven’t eaten in weeks I sent a letter to dad he told me that this is strange I think he thought I was lying. In the episode he brought grace to a wide corn field and he had a glistening object in his left pocket I couldn’t make it out. Guess I’ll wait for the new episode to come out on March. I asked bubbe what she thinking but she just laughed. I’m kind of scared but don’t know what to say or who to tell. I asked friends and they said I was lying and they thought I was being a liar liar pants on fire. Anyways I think it’s just a coincidence

"Back when I lived with my ex years ago, she used to wake me in the middle of the night. She would tell me that there were two women in our apartment. There was one standing at the end of the bed staring and the other would be in the doorway laughing. 

Of course when I would wake up there was nothing there. I would turn on all the lights and inspect the entire apartment. Never found any sign of someone being in the room. She would be crying the entire time. She would eventually calm down and fall back to sleep. 

One night I woke up in the middle of the night to her sitting up in bed crying. I asked her what was wrong and never got a response. I shook her lightly trying to see if she was okay. Still no response. I figured she may be in a sleep state and just having a bad dream. 

That was when I noticed a black silhouette of a woman at the edge of the bed. I couldn’t see her face but I could tell that her eyes were fixated on my ex. I don’t know how I wasn’t afraid. I assumed it was the adrenaline but I tried to snap my ex out of it. I shook her harder until she finally stopped crying, fell back to bed and was asleep. 

The silhouette was gone. I did the same routine of checking the apartment and never found anything. The next morning my ex told me about a dream she had. 

She said she had a dream about me standing on top of a building ready to jump. She was at the bottom crying and yelling at me to get down but I couldn’t hear her. Behind me in the dream was the woman in black whispering in my ear “jump, jump”.

"We always know it's coming. Once every year, like clockwork, a loved one, friend, close family acquaintance...one won't make it out alive. 

Every year, for 31 years, December has taken one, from someone. The misery started when I was twelve, with the taking of Ellie, my younger sister. It took three years of ""why""s and ""what""s and ""how""s before the cops retired the case to suicide. 

A year after Ellie came the day when dad would ride off for work against the glare of sunrise for the very last time. When he finally came home, he was three weeks late and cloaked in a body bag, well on his way to putrefaction.

Mother was next. An ""accident"", they said. Speeding truck, snow storm, skid marks, severed head. And every year since, our town has been plagued by December deaths, the flavours of which grew increasingly, horrendously more bizarre. That was until  this year came around. I don't quite know how to explain what's happening, but this year it seems like December just...vomited? 

Every day since the 1st of this month we have witnessed one instance of what the townsfolk are calling ""returns"". The Melvilles were the first of the lot; a family of six who passed in a tragic apartment fire in 2018. They returned today, black bodies of soot and bone all standing in the rubble of what was once their kitchen, clattering as if in anticipation of another meal.
 
2015's Breda Wilson came back slithering along the sidewalk, not unlike the venomous snake the put her down. And then there was little Tommy Turner whose bloated body resurfaced overnight in the community pool, like some kind of  sick ad for water safety. 

I know that eventually my parents will be back, and I'm honestly not afraid...of them. I can picture mom pacing back and forth along the corridors at night, a headless figure plastered against my bedroom window when I am out. The figure in the front yard that might be seen pushing snow off the footpath in a maggot-ridden skin suit is very likely to be my father. 

It's Ellie's return that would haunt me the most. I've been worried about it ever since the day she died. I'm not prepared. I can only hope that her return persona does not possess the ability to speak, and if it does, I'll have to figure out a way to send her back as quickly and cleanly as possible. She is the only one who knows what I did to her.",shortscarystories
"“You’re not... thinking of crossing the river, are you?”

Bare-chested and muscular, few had ever heard Doman speak with such apprehension.

“Why not?” Rada said. “Think of all the quarry on the other side.”

Frozen over, the river sparkled in the starlight. Across it, a rotting wooden hut, long abandoned, stood at the edge of a linden grove. Every now and then came a distant howl; Zavid’s dog howled back hoarsely, not knowing any better.

“Who do you think you are?” Zavid piped up in his boyish voice. “The crucifix man who walked on water?”

“After a fashion. I, too, have faith in our Lord,” Rada said almost indifferently.

“And what lord might that be?” Doman scoffed. “I was there when they toppled the idols and built a foreign-looking tower for the crucifix man. Mila thought it was good for us. Where is she now?”

“Who are you, anyway?” Zavid pressed on. “What’s with the coat and gloves? Are you *cold?*”

Rada looked at him, Doman, and Olisava. Fine hunters, all three, but very ragged-looking, their eyes dull with a resignation to perpetual half-hunger. Sables, weasels, and the occasional hare. Not even a deer left on this side.

“My attire has its uses,” Rada said. “Some things are best not revealed to heathens.”

“Bah. Like anyone would want a piece of *you,*” Doman said, flicking a large snowflake from his chest.

Olisava giggled. “Speak for yourself.”

“Mirth is good,” Rada said. “Even wantonness is good, as it, too, banishes fear. Come; a frozen river can do you no harm.”

“It’s still running under the ice,” Zavid said.

“You think too much.” Rada snapped off a branch and tossed it on the ice.

The dog chased after it. The dog picked it up. Then another howl came from afar, and in an instant, a skull was clutching the branch in its jaws, amid bones and dust.

“I was wrong,” Rada said. “About the dog, not the river. Cowardly.”

“You killed it!” Zavid yelled. “You killed it!”

“About time too.” Olisava bared her fangs. “Who turns a *dog!* An abomination in the Lord’s eyes.”

Zavid lunged at her, then staggered back as Rada stepped between them, removing her gloves and throwing her sable coat open. There were silver rings on both of her hands, and a crucifix on her neck.

“But you’re not quarry,” Doman said, his voice trembling. “What *are* you?”

“A believer.”

Rada took a clove of garlic out of her coat pocket, chewed on it, and spat it out. Olisava picked it up and sniffed at it, fascinated.

“I’ve crossed running water on sunny spring days,” Rada said. “Only our own fear destroys us. And those with faith in our Lord, the lord of the night, have nothing to fear.”

The four of them stepped on the ice; three reached the other bank. Without looking back, they walked through the linden grove towards the warm houses of the sleeping quarry.

“The faithful need not be invited in,” Rada said.",shortscarystories
"I’m now sitting in a rickety room with ten dollars left in a jar by a couple for babysitting two plastic dolls rested against the couch with eyes that follow me whenever I walk across the room to light a cigarette by the window at the farther end of the room. While I never would’ve done this with real children in the room, their eyes don’t seem very appreciative of the act, but the cigarette had been lit and I see a frown forming on the doll seated right across me at the other end of the hall. I guess the parents won’t be coming back home anytime soon...",shortscarystories
"THUD!!

I woke up startled. I quickly flicked on the bedside lamp and looked around. There was nothing. My partner lay snoring next to me. I realised I had probably just had a bad dream or it was probably the house settling. 

Just as I was about to dismiss the noise and fall asleep, I heard the faint melodic sound of an ice cream truck. It got further and further away until it was gone. Suddenly I shot up and looked at the time. 

3:00am

An Ice-cream truck at three in the morning. What was wrong with the driver. The ice cream truck reminded me of my daughter. She loved to go see the ice cream truck and almost always buy ice cream. I decided to check on my 4 year old daughter as I had already woken up. As soon as I went into her room, I noticed that her bed was empty. 

Everything instantly clicked together in my mind

**The thud I had heard was the door.**

**A horrifying faint scream sliced the silence suddenly. It sent never-ending chills up my spine.**",shortscarystories
"The first One lives in our souls. Nowadays, you see glimpses of It in Hong Kong, in Chile, in Lebanon. And in some places where we got so used to It that we don’t perceive It anymore; Syria, Mali, Afghanistan. You can also meet It in the fit of rage you feel as someone elbows you in the subway. In the shouting match of your upstairs neighbors. In a decent, kind woman who suddenly snaps and shoots down her son’s bully. In every election time. We call It gang violence, police blunder, rape, racism, tactical strike, aggression, genocide, class warfare. 

The second One lives in our bodies and minds. It inhabits the silent dread of understaffed hospitals. It nests in the waiting rooms of psychiatrists. You can visit It each time you go see your grandparents, slowly wasting away; or when your mate finally gets out of their room, looking like they cried, to get anything for dinner. Just like the first one, it rules entire countries and we get used to It; we call It cancer, depression, AIDS, old age, broken bones and infected wounds, flu and heart attack, diabetes or schizophrenia. 

The third One lives in our hearts. We can hear It whisper to us all the time. Each moment you stuff your face or restrain yourself to look pretty. Each time someone buys another thing they don’t need, forged by a virtual slave at the other end of the world; and each moment when a tired parent avoids the Christmas-decorated streets because they can’t afford a present for their kid. It feeds the two first Ones, because what we miss, we take it by force or it weakens us. And It’s the One we’re most afraid of, to the point of throwing others to It to avoid going anywhere near It. We call it lack, impatience, hunger, thirst, addiction, growth, consumption and alcoholism. 

We call them Horsemen. 

I met the fourth One, yesterday. It welcomes us all, in the end. It weeps as we come to It screaming, weeping, or simply shattered. Few ever come to It willingly, and these ones, It cries for their past. Many beg, or bribe, or attack It. No one ever escapes It. 

As I laid dying, as the paramedics rushed to get me to a hospital, and my fiancé cried holding my hand, I met It and It was kind. It offered me words of regrets for the acts of the three others Ones. It told me It had tried to convince Them to stop hurting us, but that They never heeded Its call. So now, as It sent me back, It gave me a message to deliver unto humankind. 

It says : “Please send Them to Me. Please banish War, Famine and Pestilence from this realm. Please be better. And when you finally do, I will welcome Them in my arms and then leave. 

Theirs will be the only Death I will ever welcome without tears.”",shortscarystories
"""Looks like he's wrapping up. You ready?""

I looked up from my notes. ""No, not really.""

The host smiled knowingly. ""First time?""

""Yeah.""

The host peeked around the curtain. ""Well, if it helps, it's not exactly a packed house. Open mics are always like this. Low expectations.”

""Thanks,"" I mumbled, wiping sweat from my eyes. ""It's just that this is something I've always wanted. It's just hard to... start.""

""Yeah, kid. We've all been there. You just gotta follow through.""

I nodded. ""Okay, I'm ready.""

The host took another look at the stage. ""You better be. It's showtime.""

The host walked through the curtain as the crowd politely clapped. ""Give it up for Ronnie, everybody!"" the host yelled. They clapped again, with even less enthusiasm this time.

Ronnie came through the curtain, breathing heavily. He looked even sweatier than I felt. ""First time?"" I asked. Without replying, he stormed past me.

""Alright,"" the host continued. ""Our next performer is a comedy virgin- _and_ he's never done standup before! Give it up for Stewart!""

I walked through the curtain, and the lights blinded me immediately. I couldn't see anything but the stage. I pushed forward, ignoring my urge to run off like Ronnie did, and got behind the mic.

I grabbed the mic. ""Uh, hi, everyone. Thanks for coming."" My eyes began to adjust to the light, and I could see the audience's figures in the darkness. ""The last time someone said that to me was at the sperm bank.""

I expected a couple chuckles, but no one made a sound.

""You guys been paying attention to politics recently?"" No response. ""Me neither. I'd rather take a nap on some train tracks at this point.""

They laughed at that. It was like a real, genuine joke had reached them. I could feel the pressure lifting.

""Yeah, you should do that,"" someone called out.

""What?"" I asked, taken aback. I didn't expect a heckler during my first set.

The man raised his hand so I could see where he was. ""You should do it, Stewart. You should _kill yourself!""_

The crowd laughed even harder at that. ""Definitely!"" a woman in the front row agreed. ""Better than trying stand up! You're not funny! You could _never_ be a real comedian!""

The laughter got even louder. The man stood up. ""If he killed himself, that would be the funniest thing he's ever done!""

I looked to the curtain, where the host was smiling knowingly again. He held up a small box, shook it and tossed it onto the stage. ""Follow through!"" he called out.

""Do it!"" a woman yelled.

""Do it!"" the man agreed. The crowd joined in, and the suggestion became a chant.

I looked down at the box. It was a pack of razor blades.

""Do it!"" the crowd screamed at me. ""Do it! Do it! Do it!""

I picked up the box. They went silent, waiting with breathless anticipation. The host, still staring from near the curtain, began to nod.",shortscarystories
"I live in a rundown apartment with my mom and him. My father used to live with us, but said he couldn’t stand his behavior anymore and left us. He is the epitome of evil. No conscious, no morals and no signs of stopping his destructive behavior.

 He killed our cat in a microwave, fed rat poison to our dog and police even came to question us over the disappearance of a tenant in the complex. We’re certain he was responsible. He has been violent towards my mother and the emotional and physical pain he’s inflicted on me is almost unbearable.


My mother and I have tried everything to quench his rage. Therapists, priests, and even spiritual healing rituals. Nothing has worked. Our last hope is the medication recently prescribed by the doctor, but he refuses to take it. He pours it down the sink, voluntarily pukes it up and becomes even more violent when we try to force it in him.

You’re probably wondering why we don’t just leave him behind, extract him from our lives like a rotten tooth. We simply can’t. He follows us anywhere we go and is relentless in his pursuit. 

Their are periods of time where he’s completely gone and our lives are blissful, but it’s often short lived. He always finds a way to creep back into our world and cling to us like a leech. My mother holds me in her arms and we both cry after his latest violent outburst. I pray he just takes the medication.

My mother tried to force the medication in him as he slept tonight with dire consequences. He awoke with a rage unlike anything seen in a human being. After a long struggle, my mother lay on the kitchen floor with knife slash wounds all over her lifeless body.

I’m fading in and out of consciousness as I struggle to subdue him. I grab a lone pill from the ground as he forcefully retrieves the knife. 

I see my reflection in the mirror as a pill dangles in my left hand and the knife is held to my throat with the right. Please take your medication I cry.",shortscarystories
"       At least everyone who wasn’t a self absorbed asshole. With the rise in racist hate groups and fascist regimes, they had to know there would be push back from the decent people in the world. What did they expect? Did they think we were just going to bury our heads in the sand, and watch as they destroyed everything? No! That’s not how it works! That’s not how it’s going to happen.
       With groups like Antifa and Anonymous on our side we grew strong. It wasn’t hard to recruit spies in the military and on the political field. There were plenty of whistleblowers who have had enough. It was surprisingly easy to gain entry to the silo with the military guides we recruited. And with the best hackers in the world on our side it didn’t take too long to rewrite the programming for this one silo. As I gave the order to launch I couldn’t help but smile. This will show them what happens when you try to force your fascist rules, and environmental disasters on good people.

"The tooth fairy didn’t look like I expected. I didn’t expect it at all, to be honest. When I snuck to my brother’s room, I wasn’t planning to try and catch her or anything. I’d figured out a long time ago that it was mom and dad leaving the money.

Nat had been a little shit, though, bragging all day about how much money he was going to get for his tooth. I’d just wanted to leave him a little present under his pillow to teach him a lesson.

I opened his door a tiny crack, as slowly and carefully as possible, to check that he was asleep. That’s when I saw that *thing*, hovering over the head of his bed. Have you ever seen those sea horses that look like a ragged bunch of seaweed? It was kind of like that, but shiny, and raw-looking, with skinny, pink tendrils that quivered with every move it made.

I stared at it for ages, without really understanding what it was- like my brain had gone to sleep. It reached some of those raw tendrils under my brother’s pillow (he was completely zonked out the whole time) and pulled out his tooth. The baby tooth filled its tiny grasp.

The fairy cupped the tooth in both- well, I guess they were its hands- so that I couldn’t see it, and it whispered to it.

&amp;#x200B;

*small; white*

*take flight!*

&amp;#x200B;

As it tossed the tooth in the air, it cracked apart. I heard it ping from across the room, and a tiny worm flew out. It squirmed in midair, drifting toward the fairy. It was more red than pink and had puny nubs instead of tendrils, but it was unmistakable.

I gasped as I realized that it was a minuscule version of the fairy. It had hatched out of my brother’s tooth.

The mother fairy jerked around at my gasp and her matt brown eyes, like tiny clots of blood in her head, locked on my own. I tensed to bolt away when, to my horror, she dove toward my brother’s head. She clamped her snaky tendrils over his mouth, covering it securely as I opened my own lips to yell for help.

Still staring into my eyes she smiled, a huge, red smile, and sang out loud:

&amp;#x200B;

*all; white*

*take flight!*

&amp;#x200B;

As my hands flew to my face, the first *crack* resounded inside my skull.",shortscarystories
"I've been feeling kind of down on myself lately. Figured I could break out of that funk by going on a tinder date, no harm in that. His name was Jason. 

""Hey, thanks for coming! Come on in, sit down. I ordered us a pizza for a movie night. Cool?"" He asked. Didn't seem like a bad time, since I didn't have to pay for the pizza or movie. ""Sure."" I nodded as I walked inside, slipping off my shoes. I took a seat on the couch as he shut the door. I looked around the apartment walls as he asked, and noticed he was a huge horror movie fan. Lots of old school movie posters and memorabilia. I realized he also had movies queued up on Netflix. Horror, go figure. 

A knock sounded at the door. It was rapid, nothing like a typical delivery knock. Jason sprang up and almost tripped running to the door. As he opened it, he already began yelling, ""Hey man! Thanks for this. Come on in, have a slice on me!"" I thought that was...strange, to say the least. Why'd he already know who it was?

""Oh, this is Lily. Lily, this is Fred!"" He beamed, taking the pizzas from Fred. Fred smiled a bit and waved. Jason moved into the kitchen and set the 3 pizzas down. Come to think of it, he didn't ask what kind I wanted or anything. ""I got a meat lovers, white, and plain. Choose your poison!"" He smiled at me, showing off the boxes. I picked up a slice of white, and moved back to the couch.

As we started the movie, I noticed I felt a bit...off. I only ate one slice of pizza, why am I so tired suddenly? And why was Fred still here? My vision faded as I dozed off into unconsciousness.

I felt myself beginning to wake up, when I realized I couldn't move my arms or legs. My eyes slowly opened, and I noticed two figures over me. Jason and Fred. 

""I summon thee, Lilith! Come, my queen. Walk through hell with me."" He yelled, as he took a knife to my right arm. 

""What the fuck?!"" I screamed. The pain was intense. It was searing. I started to begin yowling in pain, I couldn't contain it. Fred began scraping my left arm with another knife. Or maybe a needle? Like he was writing something into my skin. The pain was becoming unbareable. Without thinking, my mouth moved while I cried, ""You're not worthy to walk with ME!"" I felt a hot flash surge through my entire body.

Suddenly, I was untied. Jason and Fred were lying on their backs, not moving a muscle. I looked at my arms, and there was nothing to be seen. I felt... different. Powerful. 

Hungry. 

I crawled over to Jason's lifeless body, and peered at his face. A sudden craving consumed me.

I latched onto his neck, and began feasting. 

Consider my poison chosen.",shortscarystories
"This happened years ago when I was about 17. One of my friend’s parents were going through a divorce and his father moved out and into a trailer park for awhile. One weekend night James invited me and one of our other friends to come hang out at his dad’s new place. The trailer was small and there wasn’t much in it since his dad had just recently moved in. 

So it was just James, Kyle, and myself hanging out in this empty trailer basically. Jame’s dad wasn’t even there because apparently he had already met another women in the park and was at her place. So we ordered a pizza and just sat around getting high. 

There was a CD player and I remember laying on the floor listening to music. It was dark out and we had all the lights off. It was one of those 5 disc auto changing CD players because even after we all passed out the music just kept playing. I remember that because one of the moments that stick out most to me is waking up to the loud music. 

It was either Rob Zombie or White Zombie, I honestly can’t remember. But the beginning of the song sounded like a train was taking off and I just remember it being so damn loud. I got up to turn the volume down but the CD player was in James dad’s room. As I walked in I swear I thought I saw the silhouette of a person at the window. 

I didn’t turn the light on, instead I just stood there for a few seconds. Once I saw that there wasn’t anybody out there I quickly turned the volume down but I didn’t leave the room. I had this eerie feeling. Looking out of the room and down the hall I could see Kyle getting up. I remember he asked what was going on and why I turned the music down. 

That’s when James jumped to his feet, freaking out. He was looking on the opposite side of the room as him. We couldn’t really see anything because we were still in the hallway. James ran over to us and busted through the back/side door. That’s when Kyle and I quickly peaked past the hall and saw an older creepy ass man crawling through the window. 

So we both ran out the same door and joined James. We all 3 ran to the middle of the trailer park. I remember there being equipment everywhere as if a playground was being built. That’s when I explained to James and Kyle that I definitely seen that guy snooping around right before he broke in. 

James knew where is dads girlfriend’s trailer was so we ran there. Luckily they were both still up but his dad was pretty drunk. So even after telling him what happened, we had to convince him to check it out. We all went back to his place and of course whoever the creep was had left. Nothing had been stolen though, at least not that we could see right away. 

Honestly the way that his dad was acting, almost like he didn’t even care. I really don’t think he even believed us. I mean, it was very bizarre how it happened. We had the music up loud so whoever this person was had to have heard it. So what would make him think about just crawling through someone’s window. It doesn’t make sense, but that’s the scary part.",shortscarystories
"I remember dying. 

I remember the panic I felt when the ground gave out below me, the shock of the cold water as my body hit it, and the icy calm that washed over me as a salty brine filled my lungs. I remember all of it. I remember growing tired, my water-blurred vision growing dark, and then nothing.

That's the part that disturbs me most. I don't remember anything after that. When you read similar stories online, they all describe some kind of afterlife, but I don't remember anything. Does that mean there's nothing waiting for me after death? That my eternity will be spent in darkness; an eternal abyss?

After a couple of moments just floating through nothingness, I jolted awake, sitting upright in my bed. Confused, I looked around my room, making note of everything I've ever collected, remembering each little moment the objects held. As I looked, I couldn't shake the feeling that something seemed off. I know I died. I know I was sent to the absent afterlife. So, why am I sitting in my bed? 

Absentmindedly, I peeled back my covers to get out of bed, and was surprised to hit my wall. Wasn't my bed normally on the other side of the room? I looked around my room again, realization slowing dawning. I remembered now. My bed was on the other side of the room, and my dresser was where my bed currently is. Everything was backwards, and as I noticed more and more things out of place, chills ran down my spine.

As quickly as I could, I jumped out of bed and ran out of my room, desperately trying to find my parents. Instead of heading left and continuing down the hallway like I expected, I turned left and ran face first into a wall. With a loud groan, I slowly turned around, holding my throbbing nose. My eyes grew wide as I saw my hallway extended out in front of me, meaning it turned to the right, not the left.

Everything was backwards.

Without warning, I screamed as loud as I could, the sound echoed throughout the reversed house, leaving a deafening silence behind it. It became clear that the house was empty, and the aching loniless inched it's way towards me. With a panic, I bolted down the hall, racing towards my front door. I yanked it open as hard as I could, and froze.

There was nothing. No grass, no trees, no front steps; there was no road, no cars, no neighboring houses. There was nothing.

Every alarm instilled in me through evolution began going off, panic raced through my body, and yet I couldn't move. I stared, dumb founded at the empty void laid out in front of me. There was nothing there, only blackness. 

Did I ever escape the abyss?",shortscarystories

"*You have to recycle!*

That's what they all say.

*If we recycle and reuse our materials, we'll never run out!*

It's not true. Our resources are finite, even if we colonize the entire universe, our resources will still be finite. And they'll run out. Recycling, reusing, it's merely delaying the inevitable. Metals, minerals, plants, life, everything has an end date. And suggesting that we recycle won't do anything about it. 

But I digress.

"I can’t remember her scent anymore. The distinct intimate aroma that when detected made my hairs stand on end and quickened my heart rate with the anticipation of her being near, now a distant blurry memory. But I still see her face. I look into those icy grey eye’s,   Her coal black hair sweeping down over her face and as always I brush it behind her ear gently, lovingly. I miss her. 

I close my eyes and I can feel her fingertips still, how dainty and soft and long and elegant and oh my god I miss her.. how am I going to do this? How am I going to leave this place full of sadness and grief, of loss and death? How do I get out of here.. It started with her scent. That was the first to go now all that is left for me is the smell of death. How long until I can’t see her face anymore or feel the warmth of her soft skin against mine? I would rather it be soon, this loss is too much for me to cope with. 

I recall that my mother used to tell me that the best way to deal with a difficult situation is to distract yourself. I admit that as much as I love her and miss her I need to get her out of my head, just for a while. It doesn’t help that I see her everywhere. Everywhere I turn there’s a part of her that just sends me back into obsessively mourning her. She wouldn’t want that. It seems very soon but I need to remove every inch of her that remains so that I can begin to move on, start life fresh! Mom cleaned. I’ll try that too. I bought cleaning supplies a few days ago, I’ll start now. 

I grab my trash bags and take a deep breath before purging our apartment of every reminder of her and who she was. My friends will say I’m rushing things but I don’t have time to cry anymore, it’s now or never. I turn back to the bedroom and there she Is again. Photo’s of her staring at me smiling that beautiful smile, but I blink and see her again. Not smiling but blank. Why did we fight that last night, why is that the last memory I will have of her? Regret fills me because that’s her face now and it will never change. Now or never.

I close my eyes and I feel her lips against mine. Goodbye love. I tie the knot on the trash bags containing all the little pieces of her.  Now for the last step, I don’t remember her being this heavy.",shortscarystories
"Everyone is looking up at the sky, all of us asking the same thing, “what in the hell is that?”

I’m sitting in my backyard with my wife and kids looking at the moon. There is a large black scar across it, and of course the internet is a buzz with all kinds of theories. 

“IT’S THE NAZI MOON BASE”, to “IT’S A GIANT SPACE TURD.”

I’m not really sold on any theory yet, but I would be lying if I didn’t say the giant turd theory is what I’m hoping for. 

My children keep asking me, “daddy what is that!?” 

I keep having to tell them, “It’s a big old moon slug! Just looking for some food!”

They laugh and giggle and then we do the whole thing over, each time I come up with something different. A moon snake, A Moon Canyon, sometimes I like to say it’s a Moon tree that fell over. We do this mainly when we sit out by the fire pit in the back yard. We roast some hotdogs, make some smores, and just take in the night air before bedtime. 

Its been roughly 2 weeks since, what the internet is calling the ‘Poopy McMoonpoo’, came into existence. There has been no word from our government or NASA on what it truly is, however, you don’t need to work for NASA to get a nice shot of the moon. It took maybe 25 minutes before the photos were online. Incredibly detailed photos from some observatory in Denmark. The Moonpoo was actually a large crack in the moons surface. The Canyon was enormous, and after some simple measurements, it was easy to tell that the shape and circumference of the moon were distorted as well. Most people thought it was a meteor impact that damaged the moon, however, that notion was easily put to bed by the lack of space debris and NASA not detecting any meteors that could have done such damage. 

Days continue to go by and the Moonpoo continues to get larger and larger. The size is indistinguishable to the naked eye, but when measured with the telescope, the change is massively evident. Most of us had no idea there was anything wrong, I’m unsure if NASA or SpaceX thought there was something wrong. That is until the Moon, in real time, did the Pac-Man death animation. All it took was one person to notice before everyone was looking into the sky, watching the event take place. I could hear the TV describe what NASA had discovered as I watched the entire thing unfold.

Wait… I have no children, how do I remember my son? This is too real, way more intense than they implied. Where are these memories coming from? I remember killing these men, the guards want me to kneel and submit allegiance.

Jerry continued to work. He had other things to worry about, things much more important than whatever his classmates were so enamored with. 

He could hear them whispering and running over to the large row of windows overlooking the playground. Chairs scraped against the floor. It nearly broke his concentration. 

Michael was arguing with someone, though Jerry couldn’t make out what they were saying. Not over the roar. 

“What’s that?”

“Whoa!” 

“Do you think it’s a plane?”

“It can't be! It’s not even moving! How could it be a plane if—?” 

“A helicopter maybe?” 

“G-guys?” 

Jerry was about to throw his pencil at one of them when it happened. A flash. Bright light. 

An inhale. Like the air had been sucked into a vacuum cleaner, taking everyone’s voice along with it. Silence fell upon the classroom. 

Jerry glanced up from the worksheet. 

They were still standing before the windows, staring out. Far out. Way far out. 

But their eyes were now completely white. 

He saw the look of surprise on their faces. 

And he looked at the window closest to his seat, past the playground and the skyscrapers and the clouds. 

And he saw… 

… nothing. 

Just pure blue sky.",shortscarystories
"The doors opened and everyone exited, except Karl. I wasn't going back up to the office but I also wasn't going to miss this opportunity.

""Hi, Karl!"" I said enthusiastically.

I entered and stood next to him, my shoulder gently touching his muscular arm. The doors closed and we started moving. Glancing at the button console and seeing the 47th floor lit up, I thought to myself, only twelve more floors to go. Then I felt his hands around my face and his tongue parting my lips. Next I felt them gripping my thighs and working up my skirt. Just as I was about to undo his belt, we halted to a stop.

""Karl, did you feel that? I think we stopped."" I laughed when I realized it was he who hit the ""emergency stop"" button. He was now undoing my bra.

All of a sudden the lights went out. We stopped, confused. In spite of the hot foreplay, this was getting a little weird.

""Do you think it's because you hit the stop button?""

Things went from a little weird to worrisome when he said he never hit the ""emergency stop"" button. I pulled away and nervously started pressing the ""call for help"" button. A voice came over the intercom:

*""Only one survives.""*

""What the fuck?! Karl, this isn't funny."" I continuously pressed the ""open doors"" button but nothing happened. Then something did.

The lights were still out but I could feel the water on my toes, rising quickly to my ankles. Before I knew it, it was up to my calves. I started to panic.

""Karl?!""

Using the lit up 47th floor button as a guide, I found the ""alarm"" button. With the water rising to my knees and my eyes still trying to adjust to the darkness, I accidentally pressed the ""call for help"" button again.

*""Only one survives.""*

""Karl! What do we do?!"" I half coughed, half said. I couldn't see it but I could tell I was breathing in something noxious.

I reached out for Karl but felt nothing. Then the fucking lights started to flicker. I didn't see Karl but I did catch a glimpse of the dense gas floating down from the ceiling vents. The lights continued to flicker.

""Karl!"" I screamed. And then I felt it.

*CRACK*

I dropped Tiffany's lifeless body and made my way to the button console. I spammed the ""call for help"" button. There was no voice this time. I kept spamming it and then all of a sudden, the lights came back on. The water started to drain. The dense gas dissipated. I removed my tie from my mouth. Coughing, I pressed the ""open doors"" button. They began to open. I was at the 47th floor. Could it be that easy?

After a final glance back at Tiffany, I began to step out but the sharp, metal spikes protruding from the ceiling and floor stopped me in my tracks.

"I was watching tv when I heard the clang and clatter of the letterbox. I frowned when I saw how late it was...far too late for mail.

I frowned again as I approached the front door and saw a pile sprawled haphazardly on my 'welcome' mat.

I picked it all up and instantly realised that it wasn't mail at all...they were photographs.

There were six pictures altogether, and all of the same room; A bathroom...*My* bathroom.

I quickly unlocked and opened the front door to stick my head out...I scanned up and down the road...

No one.

The street was as quiet and empty as it normally was, just some leaves blowing in the cold wind. I closed the door and flipped through the pictures again.

At first glance, they all looked like the same picture; A bathtub with some shampoo and other products scattered around the edge, and all taken from the same perspective. I nearly ripped them up until I noticed a small red mark on the side of the tub in one of them. It didn't take long for me to realise that the red mark was blood.

I flipped to the next photo and saw the red mark again, but this time, in a different place.

I flipped to next photo...and the next...each time, the blood mark was in a different place.

I frowned confusingly.

It must have been staring at the photographs that brought it to my attention, but suddenly, I desperately needed the toilet. 

Half-way through relieving myself, I hear the handle to my front door depress...my eyes popped open, and the sound of the winter wind grew louder, confirming my heart-pounding suspicion...

*...I'd forgotten to lock the door...*

The wind ceased as I heard the door close again.

I sat on the toilet holding my breath, my body frozen with fear...then I heard the creak of the floorboards on the second stair...the creak I'd heard so many times before, and one that I'd grown to hate. 

The bathroom door was slightly ajar and I wanted so badly to reach out and close it, but the fear was just too great.

I remained frozen, silently praying that this wasn't real, that this was all just some terrible nightmare...then, the bathroom door slowly pulled to a close...

I sat on the toilet with my legs shaking, my heart thumping, and my lungs rapidly sucking in and out tiny sips of air. I could see their shadow moving through the gap at the bottom of the door. 

**Knock...Knock...Knock.**

I stopped breathing once more.

**Knock...Knock...Knock.**

A folded piece of paper was then slid beneath the door. It glided across the floor-tiles towards me. Inside, was a rusty razor blade.

The paper read;

'It's your choice how it ends...you have 60 seconds.'

For some unknown reason, I looked down at the pictures that were still in my hand...

In each and every picture, on the side of each tub, there was a rusty razor blade.

"She was blindfolded, she couldn’t use her powers like that.

She tried to struggle in her chair but she was tied with what felt like a rope.

“Tell us!” a voice shouted, it sounded like a man’s voice.

She felt something hit her cheek hard, “I know you have a powers you freak! We just need to know what your powers are!”

She grinned, “I don’t have any idea what you’re talking about.”

She felt him grab her by her throat and lift her up from the chair, no that was wrong.

He lifted the chair along with her.

“Tell me freak!” He yelled as he shook her. “Tell us what your powers are!”

It was an uncharitable thought, Sadie knew. Unkind even, and she always tried to curb unkind thoughts when they were about other women. Especially at work. But the fact of the matter was that Lisa was speaking about nothing of substance, and the timbre of her voice betrayed that she knew it.

Sadie watched Lisa's widening eyes as they hopped from face to face around the conference table. When they landed on her own, Sadie gave a small supportive smile. Lisa audibly exhaled, but didn't steady.

""And that,"" she was saying, ""is why this study is, uh, so necessary. To, uh, allow us to understand, exactly, what it is we don't know. Thank you.""

Lisa sat down, looking like laundry crumpling into a chair. They all looked down.

Derek cleared his throat and dismissed the room. He shook his head at Lisa as she started to rise, and she settled back down into her chair. Sadie gathered her phone and notes and tried not to look back at Lisa as she slipped through the conference room door.

At best, Sadie thought, Lisa had been unprepared. At worst, she was incompetent. A shiver ran down Sadie's spine.

She was most of the way down the hallway when she heard the thud and the familiar sound of blood splattering against the conference room window.

"That time of year again where everyone has lights up, stockings on the fire place, a tree in their front window, over the top decorations and milk and cookies set out for Santa. I've never been fond of Christmas, but I have to be. You see, I'm an elf at the North Pole. I do Santa's work and Mrs. Claus's, but sometimes she helps me.

The only reason I hate Christmas as much as I do is because I've never had a good one. When I was a young child, before I got the invitation to be a elf, I loved Christmas. I just never got the chance to put up a tree or decorate because we were very poor.

Other then that, I'm forced into loving Christmas now. I'm in my bedroom currently as Santa goes off and delivers his presents to the kids.

I always hate when Santa comes home, though.

Reason being we go through this, almost ritual like ceremony. It's to ensure that us elves will never leave.

Santa takes a knife and cuts anywhere he wants on us elves. Once he does this, he opens the cuts with his fingers more to peer inside. If one elf is starting to have dry blood or it's not as light as it should be, he takes them to the shed and kills them.

And I only know this because I've seen it happen before.

I was in the shed, on the top little loft area where all the hay is for the reindeers. I watched him butcher the elf in a crude way. I panicked, waited for him to leave, and then left the shed myself.

I never eat the meat pies for a reason.",shortscarystories

Every night he woke up at least 3 times before he noticed that it was already time to wake up and get out of bed.

Peter had visited some doctors and tried various techniques, some of them helped for some time.

Until he tried the Specialized Redlabel ultra comfort mattress.

He was skeptical at first but it was a “Money back if it fails” deal he bought it.

The salesman reassured him that it would give even the hardest insomniac a good night's rest.

He tried it himself and told him that if it he even woke up once that night he would pay him back and pay him his next meal.

"It was a long, long, hallway. Too long in fact, stretching endlessly into the distance; a pale figure staggering down on coltish legs, desperately leaning on the rough hewn wall for stability. Crumpling to the ground for the third time in as many endless moments, they let out a choked gasp, mercurial drops hitting their face, from somewhere above. 

They had been moving for moments or infinity; time was fluid here, so it was difficult to tell exactly how long, but all they had to do was reach the exit and they would be free (from the skeletal fingers and dirty claws, gaunt faces and dripping fangs). Each halting step was a step closer, to what? They could only figure that it could be better than this. 

Hopefully. Maybe. Anything would be better.

Pushing themselves up again, the floating voices that dogged their every step began to resemble mocking chants once more, almost feeling the wavering determination.

""Little child, little child, leave your will and stay awhile…""

Their shadow flickered, seeming to grow, before settling as they shook off the words once more, always a misstep from staying forever.

""Little one, little one, please come back! This is fun!""

It was a long, long hallway, and only ever seemed to grow longer with each mocking giggle that followed.







In a world far away, a large figure loomed over a small, prone body, bird like in its frailty. A chorus of humming, beeps, and whispered words made up the symphony of the room they occupied. Tears rolled down the fathers cheeks, dripping onto the gaunt and bruised face laying below, begging for forgiveness for the terror that his choice wrought, that his wife wrought. If only he knew. Humming another refrain of a lullaby he always sang to his beautiful child, he only could hope that they would come back to him.",shortscarystories
"I’m not sure when this started, but it’s getting worse. Our family – myself, Janie and our 8-year-old daughter, Julie – have been sick for the past week; fevers, night sweats, chills. The worst are the bad dreams; dreams in which my wife moans about lurching shapes coming for her and I have paralyzing visions of misshapen, faceless monsters with glowing red eyes. 

Janie is worried about something in our house making us sick, some post-modern malady like that shit you see on Oprah. I’m worried, too, but it’s not black mold or toxic carpets. It’s something more malevolent, something not man-made. Something elemental.

Last night, Janie cried out “it’s not a *real* wig!” in the most terrified and pitiful voice you can imagine. 

Julie woke up today, her little face shining with fever and sweat and just said “she’s swimming through the fire…she’s swimming with her wings *through the fire!*” and then collapsed back on her bed. 

Other things are happening to us as well; Janie tried to make coffee yesterday. She put meat in the filter basket and filled the reservoir with salad oil. When I tried to gently walk her back to bed, I could tell she was still caught in the throes of one of those dreams. She looked absently at me with vacant moon eyes and said “I think he might be less dead than last time.”

Today I forgot how clocks work.

I stare at the old Grandfather clock in the hallway and the face makes absolutely no sense. It’s just a jumble of lines and blurred numbers, numbers that change and move, swirl and dance.

Taking care of my wife and my daughter, all while suffering chills and aches of my own, has taken its toll on me. They’re now sleeping, more or less peacefully – no moans or screams in hours, although I have no idea what time it is – with a little chemical help from Xanax. I might take a chance on sleep myself, although I’m afraid of what horrors sleep will bring.

Lightheaded, I lay down. I feel the pillow, cool against my cheek. I doze, I drift. 

I dream. 

I dream of the faceless shapes again, the gathering terrors that loom over me as I sleep. 

I can’t move. Not a muscle. 

I can’t move anything and the shapes are getting nearer. Almost to me.

The shapes...*change*. They become filamentous, flickering, their red eyes morphing to yellow, then orange. I feel their hot breath on my face and I still can’t move. 

I see their eyes expand, cross the ceiling, grow to immense size. *Those…those are not eyes,* I think.

*Fire*. 

Fire crosses the ceiling like an army of spiders, the plaster curling and blackening. And I still can’t move, limbs frozen and useless.

As I am consumed, as the charred plaster falls on me like Satan’s tears, I think of my wife and daughter, drugged and asleep, and then I think no more.",shortscarystories

Diagnosis: Severe Depression/Psychopathy

Assumed cause of diagnosis: Extreme stress.

Crimes committed: Robber/Murder

Diary:

    You've seen it in in cartoons, the angel and demon that sits on a characters shoulders and talks. The demon is evil and the angel is good. 
    Well, I have too. Not the angel but the demon. The demon killed the angel along while ago. The demon is always there, it never leaves. It sits there and decides my every move. I can never do anything good, because the angel isn't there. Even if I try the demon stops me. 
    If I do something good it tells me its not or that I should stop doing that. It tells me to do terrible things, and I do it. Its my fault. I shouldn't have helped him kill the angel. He told me too. At the time, I think I was fine. But then it got worse.
    I stopped thinking the demon was a seperate entity, it's a part of me.
    It is me.
    I know that I shouldn't have listend too it when it told me rob that bank. I knew when it told me to shoot that poor acountant that I was doing something wrong. I sit here in an insane asylum, writing this, knowing fully well that no one will believe me when I tell them that ""the demon told me to do it"". 
    They just diagnose me with severe depression and psychopathy. I might be depressed, that might be what the demon is. But the day the demon killed the angel was the day it started to spiral.

Around Thanksgiving, I was coming home from a party my friend was hosting. Since his house was only a block away, me and my wife decided to walk home, what could happen?

While we were rounding the corner, a figure darted across the street. 

It was covered in a mist of darkness, so we thought it was a child going to see their friend. So, we thought nothing of it.

But while we kept walking, it noticed us, and darted back to our side.

A little worried at this point, I told my wife to go the back way, so we turned and walked the other way. But it followed.

I noticed it walking towards us, and so I told her to pick up the pace, and so we speed walked.

Then it started to speed walk.

So we started to jog.

It started jogging.

We ran.

It ran.

We started to sprint.

It sprinted in return.

We were terrified at this point, so I told my wife to go ahead and I'd deal with whatever this was.

So I turned and started to cuss it out, me being the Irishman I am.

It then walked towards me, and I was getting unnerved. 

I then grabbed a large rock from the ground, and that pissed it off enough to make it sprint full force at me.

It tackled me, and started to gnaw at my throat.

Luckily, I had the rock, so I decided to smash it's head in.

Was I in an accident? What's the last thing I remember? I don't know, the pain is intense! Calm down! You're a Dr, you should be able to diagnose this… wait, I am a Dr.. I was doing rounds.  I hear the monitors, I'm still in the hospital! What happened? Was I in an accident? Wait.. I'm not breathing on my own, I'm intubated.. this is serious. The pain.. it's unbearable, I can't move, am I paralyzed? Keep calm, think! Take a deep breath and relax... I can't control my breath... I'm on a ventilator, relax. Noises, blurry movement, oh good it's the nurse, it's Amy, get her attention she'll explain. Why isn't she acknowledging me?? Grunt do anything! Oh no she thinks it's pain, no Amy not more drugs I need to talk… Wow, no pain, bright lights blurry, nothing

It's so bright, the pain, did I drink last night? No, something is wrong, wait we went through this, morphine.. damn that’s what Amy gave me. This has to be serious. What's the last thing I remember?

Wait voices, I can almost turn my head, focus, there, a Dr is meeting with 3 members of a family. Why are they looking at me? Who is the Dr? I can't make her face out, I would definitely recognize her, she has a very similar appearance to me wait, identical! The family.. that's Veronica's family.. a flash

While doing rounds I checked on Veronica, terminal pancreatic cancer, nothing I can do. Pain medication and comfort until she passes, the family will not sign the DNR to terminate. It's fuzzy but I remember saying if there's anything more I could do I would. In my head a voice, “Come here and help”, her eyes turned completely black, the voice in my own head, “You can help child, look into my eyes.” We must have switched bodies. I know it’s not possible but it fits. Think! You must think, time is short! They’ve signed the DNR, Amy is going for the meds! Stop! Think! Don’t Panic… This is it! Stop! Think!

Maybe I gained the power to switch us back when it happened. Focus, call to them “Come here and help!” Nothing, think it right into their brains! She’s too powerful and they’re too distracted, it’s not working. I can’t die, I’m a doctor!! I save lives! Last try… “COME HERE! HELP!”

"“Why won’t my fork go in?” Lenny heard his little girl growl, and turned to help her with cutting her steak. 

He knew it was hard for Amy. It had been especially difficult for him back when he first ate at Roughhorn. His father had to grab the fork and knife from him, then slice up the fillet of cow meat. 

They always cooked it thick. And like father, like daughter. Neither of them liked it thick. His wife and her mother? Sure. But them? No. 

“Hey. Hey,” he reached over to take her knife, a smile curling his withered mustache. “Amy, sweetheart. Let me do it.” 

That’s when it happened. The second his eyes landed on the heap of steak, oozing juices onto her plate, he saw it.

"Swift, leathery wings beat against the night sky. I sat silently in the dense forest underbrush and watched the humanoid shapes pass overhead. While on the ground, I slowly retreived a rusty knife blade from my boot that I had found on the trail earlier. I wanted to flee right then but I knew that if I tried, Johnathan would beat me again. Just like he had the last two times I tried to escape. Plus we were now in the Outlands, where it’s dark, always. It’s like the sun abandoned this part of the world and if you left the protection of the light rods, the gargoyle like beasts would make a quick meal of you.
 
Myself and the other five women were being herded like cattle to Port City so that Johnathan could sell us as slaves. He had four guards posted around us with the light rods, as long as we stayed within the light we were safe. At least, from the beasts, not so much from our human captors.
 
As soon as the beasts were gone we were forced to start marching again. We were now moving uphill and following a small footpath that wound its way through the mountains. As we marched I postitioned the rusty old blade in my fingers so that I could slowly start cutting away at my bonds. Several hours passed by, my bonds were cut, I continued holding my hands in place to look like they were still tied. Just waiting for the right moment. I saw that moment as we approached a rope bridge spanning across a canyon. The bridge was narrow and we would have to travel across single file.
 
Just past the woman in front of me was a guard. In one swift motion, I leaped up and kicked the back of his knee, planted my right foot into the ground and shoved the back of his head with everything I had while also reaching over and grabbing his light rod. He tumbled over into the canyon. He was immediately lost from view but we could hear him being ripped apart. At that moment everything seemed to explode into action. The other women attacked the remaining guards and Jonathan was now charging directly at me.
 
He was big. He liked using his size and weight against opponents. But I knew this, I had suffered two of his beatings already. Just as he got close to me I feined tripping and went down on the ground, Jonathan leapt. He meant to pin me but as he came down I rolled away, leaving my rusty blade planted in the ground. He impaled himself in the chest but he wasn’t dead, I was glad. We tied him to a tree and left him for the beasts. Halfway across the bridge I turned and looked, they were eating him alive.
 
Two weeks later we arrived in Port City. And we had three human males to sell as slaves.",shortscarystories

The disease kills you, the doctor said, but only when it gets its chance. The germs are weaker when you're awake. But when you're asleep, they nearly instantly spread through your body, destroying every living cell in its path. 

There is no cure, but there is treatment.

I've tried everything I could to stay awake. I've burnt my hands so the pain would keep me awake. I've shined lights in my eyes until the bulbs flickered out. I've contemplated slicing off my eyelids multiple times.

""For the 79, Joe""

I opened the box and there were a recorder and a single list with a bunch of names. At the end of the list, it wrote:

""Find them, Kill them, Show me, Joe.""

""What the hell did you just sent to me?""

""Read the note, Joe. Do it for me, Joe.""

""How do you know my address?""

""Not important Joe. Do what the note said, Joe.""

""I don't care about the note, psycho. How the hell do you my address?""

""Do as the note told, Joe."" She appeared behind me and choked me. I tried to fight but her grip was strong. She let go and disappeared and reappeared back on the stream.

 ""Against me, you can't Joe. Complete the note, Joe."" Her stream cut off just like that.

Emma and I are the only one who know it.

I don’t know when Emma obtained the power to loop time but she did at some point this year.

And today it is her happiest day.

Today she turned 11 and all her friends were here.

Today she finally stood up to her bully, the one who kept stealing her stuff.

The bully who pushed her into the dumpster.

The bully who made everyday of Emma’s life hell.

But not today.

Today it was Emma’s happiest day.

Tomorrow it would be Emma’s happiest day.

Everyday will be Emma’s happiest

And tomorrow…

Tomorrow I will wake up in total blindness again.

Tomorrow I will again be unable to escape the small animal cage in the cellar she put me in.

Tomorrow I would again realise that no one would be looking for me.

And at the end of today it would all start again.

Yes, today was Emma’s happiest day.",shortscarystories
"I looked up and saw the person I hate most looking at me

He's always making me feel like I am worthless and like everyone hates me
And sure, he may have a point but that doesnt mean that he has to remind me every 10 minutes

He always finds new things to say to me
This time I have had enough, I decide that he has hurt me enough with his words and his endless tormenting.
I grab the knife from my pocket and decided to mess him up

After a little while and a lot of cuts later I finally step away from my mirror",shortscarystories
"  

To Whom it may concern,

It has been 8 days since I have slept. The voices haven’t stopped and the things I keep seeing are only getting worse. While it isn’t as bad as when I would sleep, it is growing worse and worse. I know I sound crazy and I don’t care since what I am about to say needs to be said. They are following me and whispering to me, I don’t know exactly what they are but I know they want me dead. It could be ghosts, demons, or something even more terrible. Even now I can hear them telling me what they want me to do, whispering in my ears. I have never found myself a religious person, but I began to pray.. to what, I don’t know but hopefully some God out there is listening. My body is cold and my neck is so sore, maybe it is because I haven’t slept. No, that’s a lie… because when I look in the mirror I can see, I see them with their hands wrapped around my throat. Trying to kill me, or urging me to die, I’m not entirely sure yet. It started at Aokigahara, I went days ago on a solo hike and nothing has been normal since. I think I brought something back with me, maybe even more then one. I’m writing this to urge everyone not to go into that forest, It is dangerous. I plan to send this to every major news organization inside Japan and the US as well as everyone I know. You may think I’m crazy, but so be it. To get the truth out the real truth is better than living this way…

To whom it may concern, 

This is the same letter, but I have updates. I tried to call my sister last night while writing my letter and the phone wouldn’t dial out. So I tried calling my mother and then my best friend. I even became so desperate that I attempted to call my boss. But there was nothing just static. I figured since my phone wasn’t working I’d attempt to email them, but my computer won’t turn on. My last attempt at contacting them was leaving my apartment, but my door won’t open, nor will any of my windows. When I try to look out of my doors peephole or my window it’s just dark, there is nothing there. I don’t know what this is, but all I know is I’m stuck inside my apartment. It’s getting colder inside and these things keep whispering in my ears. They keep squeezing my already sore neck. I know now that I have no contact with the outside world and tomorrow will be day 10 without sleep and I’m just wondering, how long can I last?",shortscarystories
" Shadows are always around you, whether it’s day or night. Whether you’re outside or inside. They follow you and mimic you. Sometimes they appear elongated and other times they appear normal. We’ve become numb to our shadows, we don’t even acknowledge them. Science has proven that shadows are really just places where light doesn’t make it. Our bodies cover the light and so behind us it’s darker because less light is there. 

I’ve had a very different experience with shadows. Sometimes shadows are attached to their owner, sometimes they aren’t. Whenever the shadow is detached, not connected with its owner, it signifies near death. The distance between the detached shadow and the owner can also give a glimpse of how close their death is. The further the shadow, the closer the death. Here are some of the most chilling events I’ve experienced with this phenomenon. 

* I was walking around the city when I saw an old man with his shadow literally running away from him. One blink later his body is spread out across the road by a massive truck that accidentally crashed into him.
* As I was crossing the road, I saw that everyone on the street around me had their shadows drifting off, mine included. I took a few steps back and my shadow came closer until it met me again. Then I saw a person fall from the balcony of a tall building. Turns out he lands on a man on the ground killing him in the process. The people crossing the road stop obviously shocked and a bus runs over them. A whole group of people wiped out
* Another time a man was doing repairs in my home. He held his long flashlight in his mouth as he fumbled with the wires trying to fix my RGB lights. He slipped off the step ladder and landed on his face. The torch ruptured his skull and he faced an awful death

So as you can see the detached shadow doesn’t mean you can’t avoid the death it’s just a warning signal. I’ve used it countless times to prevent my own death. 

You may be wondering why I’m typing this out or why I’m telling this now. It’s because for the last few days everywhere I go. Everyone's shadows are drifting away from them. Literally every single person in every place I’ve went. I don’t think there is a next week.",shortscarystories
"On Monday, I got a notification. Amanda had sent a request to privately message me. Her profile pic was the same. Lively eyes. Broad smile. 

I ignored her. 

On Tuesday, another notification. This time, she wanted to follow me. Even though we were no longer friends. 

Like before, I ignored her. 

Wednesday rolled around, and a third notification graced my phone. She had liked a selfie of me and my cat. And commented on it. A heart emoji. 

I deleted the post. 

Yesterday, I heard that familiar buzzing sound. I didn’t dare to look at it. Or even read it. Not this time. 

I blocked her. 

Today, while I was taking a shower, my phone started to ring. 

And ring. 

And ring. 

And ring. 

I’m standing here, wearing nothing but a towel. Staring at the number displayed on the screen. I haven’t picked it up yet. And I don’t think I’ll ever answer. 

But it’s still ringing. 

She won’t stop calling to me. 

Amanda will never leave me alone. She’ll never let me go. She still thinks that we’re friends. 

Even though the funeral was a month ago.",shortscarystories
"I was captured during the siege; dragged away, beaten, and thrown in a dimly-lit cell. Rats scurried across the floor, their red eyes watching me with equal amounts of hunger and curiosity. I knew that if I lost consciousness, or if they sensed defeat in me, they’d swarm; devour me as I’m sure they’d done so many others. So, I stayed awake, kept my eyes open despite the pain that seemed to work its way endlessly through flesh and bone. 

Hours passed and more prisoners were tossed into my cell. It wasn’t a large space, no bigger than a closet, and the door was one tall slab of iron without a window. No bars existed which would’ve allowed sight beyond the enclosure.  

My cellmates were in worse states, but they still kept their sanity and mindfulness. The flesh-boated rats weren’t the only thing to be feared. We knew our captors were watching us, through whatever spying instrumentation they employed, and if any of us were to seem off our game, the watchers would swoop in and take them away.  

The noises of the world beyond the cell came in dulled, distorted; just clear enough to give suggestions of the horrors beyond, without letting you focus on whom they were inflicted. Screams, weapons-fire. the grinding of machines whose purpose remains a mystery to me; it all came through. It rattled your bones, all night, and grimly aided in the perpetuation of wakefulness.  

Eventually, after the concepts of light and sleep became but half-remembered things, the cell door was opened, and a figure stood in the threshold. It brought out a blade and tossed it into the room. It closed the door, and from some hidden speaker came the announcement: “If you want a taste of freedom, you will use the knife. I will return in ten minutes. I expect only one of you to remain. Any more, and you’ll all be thrown in to the fires.”  

There were six of us crammed into that capsule of a cell. Six of us who hadn’t seen daylight or food, who hadn’t heard music or felt anything but cold and hard stone. I was the first in that cell, I remembered then, when that knife clattered to the ground. The first for a while—those others came later. I hadn’t slept in days or weeks, my mind on the verge of black madness.  

When the man returned, he found one prisoner alive. He instructed the prisoner to toss out the knife, and they complied. He led them down a bright hallway, had them fed in a spacious room, in which they also slept; for an entire day. Then, when the prisoner had recovered a semblance of comfort and wellness, he placed them into a cell with five others.  

There is one in this cell whose face seems particularly famished, worn, yet grimly determined. I know another knife will come into this cell, and I know against whom I must contend for my survival. ",shortscarystories
"""Please, don't kill me"", I pleaded while I looked down at the reflection in the water below the bridge I was standing on. She had long blonde hair, brown eyes, and were fairly skinny. She looked like she had everything one person could wish for, and yet a tear ran down her cheek. 

""Why are you doing this to me"" I yelled at her with a panicing voice. The figure did not answer. 
""My life was amazing before you came"", I yelled at her. ""I had friends, a great family, and I was at the top of my class. Since you came in my life all went downhill. I'm barely passing my classes, you have isolated me from my friends and family. All you do is making me feel hatred towards myself. I never wanted to come near you. I tried to get rid of you, but you didn't care. You just keept hanging on to me, ruining my self esteem, sucking all the joy I had for life away. I went to theapy but it did not help for you were still there, telling me day and night that I was unloveable, ugly, weird, gross ect.""  

"" I want to be free. Free from the pressure my parents are putting me under to get top grades in every class, free from the fake people, who claimed to be my friends, but left me when I became to difficult, free from dissapointing the few friends I have left, and most importantly, free from the self-hatred that you, depression, has caused me the last year"".

"“In tonight’s poll, we asked the audience what each door would have behind it, and here are the predictions:

Door number one: Giant snake with 87% votes!

Door number two: An Alien with 54% votes!

And last, but hardly least, behind door number three, scarecrow with 100% of the audience’s vote! Choose your fate!” he cheered, holding a gun to the back of her head as he nudges her toward the three dark blue doors.

“But, I don’t…” she starts and is cut off with another shove.

“You know what you did. Now, choose your fate!” The man yells as the audience behind them cheers loudly. The woman’s eyes scan over the hundreds of gleeful spectators, not thinking about the thousands more watching from home.

The three doors in front of her are marked with one, two, and three, the numbers painted black. She slowly steps in front of door number one as she looks back at her captor.

“You chose this life, this is your fate. The law abiding citizens of this country are patiently waiting. You don’t want to let them down, do you?” The man says softly, speaking into the microphone that hangs off of his collar, the blue mask covering his face moves as he speaks. The woman takes a tiny step closer to door number one.

“Is that your choice?” The man barks into the microphone as the audience’s cheers drowns out the woman’s thoughts. She shrugs.

“Alrighty then! She chose door number one. Producers, go ahead and press door number one. Let’s see what's waiting!” The spectators stand and scream as a man behind a large podium hits a large button as door number one swings open.

The woman gasps as a large Ogre standing ten feet tall bursts out of its cage and charges at the woman. It picks her up, squeezing its arms around her body as it bites a chuck of flesh off of her neck. Swallowing her meat, it takes another bite, devouring the woman as quickly as it can.

“What a bummer, I was really hoping we’d see the giant snake! We haven’t seen her since the first season. Well, anyway, that’s all for tonight folks! We got to see ten criminals choose their fate. Be sure to watch next week as we have criminals raging from tax fraud to addiction. It will absolutely quench your thirst for justice!”",shortscarystories
"I hate when people ask me if I believe in ghosts. It’s not a common question, but it’s always unwelcome and stupid and I hate it so fuck you.

I’ve been dead for years. Of course I believe in ghosts.

Even when I tell the truth the response is always, “such a joker, Gary!” Fuck you, Hank. I know your attitude is 25% gratitude, 75% cocaine.

Lying is almost better. Tell them I don’t believe in myself. Haha, me_irl. So funny, wish I could die.

No, seriously. I used to wish I were dead, but unholy fuck this is so much worse. There’s no fancy gates and halos and shitty harp music, nor is there fire, brimstone, and cold olive and pineapple pizza. Yes, that’s a thing. Yes, I’d prefer it.

The haunting thing is real, too. Sort of. After you die you’re tied to the place you obsessed over most. Not necessarily where you died. Not where you wish you died. And certainly not where you want to be.

It’s usually work. It’s almost *always* work. What, your 9 to 5 is horrible? I LIVE HERE. That’s a ghost joke. Since I’m dead. Get it? It’s not funny? Fuck you.

Afterhours isn’t so bad. I’m stuck here with others who perished long before me, though only the more recently deceased can carry a conversation. The older ghosts have long since lost their minds. Most of them don’t even speak English. Fortunately they keep to corners, staring up at nothing. Unblinking. Forever.

It gets creepy sometimes. And that’s saying something, considering I’m a ghost and all.

“But how did you die?” That’s you. I know it, because that’s all everyone who’s dead ever talks about. I’m not implying you’re dead inside, even though you probably are, it’s just that people are so obsessed with death these days. It’s always the same shit. “Heart attack.” “Car accident.” “I just woke up like this.” Okay Dan. Sure. It totally wasn’t that heroin overdose.

Death isn’t all that interesting. “I don’t believe you,” you think. You’re the same dicks who don’t believe in ghosts, but here I am, literally explaining it all. There’s no light. No choir. Just, like… a bad headache. And some scratchiness in your throat.

I guess it could be worse. Though I’m stuck at work I don’t have to do anything. Whenever I go crazy people forget about it or think I’m joking. I think that’s part of the afterlife; you can’t really affect the living world. Sure, you can try poltergeisting things, which can be amusing, but it doesn’t last long.

And yeah, I can walk through walls and become invisible. You get over it pretty quickly though. There’s something inherently gross about watching people fuck in the bathroom during lunch anyhow.

I suppose if there’s one thing I’d change, it wouldn’t even be heaven. Not nonexistence. Not even just being alive again.

I just want one person. One single person. To believe me, when I tell them.",shortscarystories
"I love my Mum - she was always there. 

She passed away last week and even though she was a bit overwhelming she was the best. 

She gave me everything I wanted as long as I played by her rules:

1. No boys or girls in the house - everyone can hang out on the shed or garden
2. No staining the walls or carpet
3. Washing stained clothes immediately 
4. Never taking tools from the house 
5. No social media - no pictures
6. Always take your shoes off in the house, always wear gloves and tie your hair 
7. Don't forget to feed the pigs

I know she was a bit intense and weird, but you need to understand she was just trying to protect me from me - in the end, she was the one who knew where to bury the bodies and you bet she was good; not even a single bone has been found and she was always supportive of my hobby.",shortscarystories
"He always woke me up every night with his piercing screams. You would think he would stop at some point but you would be wrong. There is a part of me that thinks that he was not capable of loving another person. When he was hungry I would make food for him but he would just throw the plate across the room. After he had done that he would just look at me and smile as if to insult my dignity. I hated that ugly smile. I am sure he would do that just to annoy me with his missing teeth.

Well one day I decided enough was enough. I took a knife and drove it straight through his chest. The house is more peaceful now with him gone. No more screams. The long silent nights have returned.

So this morning I wake up at 7, like every other morning. I grab my phone and head to the bathroom. I scrolled through my social media apps but I just couldn't find a way to entertain my self. So I decided to go through my phones gallery, when oddly enough I find pictures of myself sleeping. My first thought was that my girlfriend probably took these when she was over last week. She comes for a week each month and she had just left yesterday afternoon.  There were a total of seven photos and as I clicked on each of them taking my time to delete them I noticed that the date of the photos was a day after my girlfriend came.

The book had beautifully drawn images wich felt really alive. It was the story of hansel and gretzel, Wich i knew very well since my mother used to read it to me all the time.

"So here's the thing. I fell in love two years ago, exactly on December 31st 2017. Now, I am young and still feel like I have so many things to learn. I have never wanted to marry or have kids or start a family or spend the rest of my life with someone, most of it due to watching how my parents were and are ever since I was a little child. Love for me was what I saw in movies and for me it was liking someone and having your heart beat fast and for someone to think you are attractive and to kiss and hold hands. That changed for me when I fell in love for the first time but it didn't last. The guy led me on and shamed me for loving him in front of all my peers and friends and seniors. 

I wasn't even looking for love when I found HIM. I met him at New Year's Eve thing and at first, he seemed weird and unusual and to me not that far from possibly...crazy. I thought that was the last time I would see him but little did I know that I would see him again the next day and the day after and the day after and the day after. Somehow, we kept randomly bumping into each other and we started talking. Four days into it, I had become his friend and was about to leave when I was hanging out with him and our friends when our eyes met over the crowd and I swear to mother-fu\*king god, his eyes were the most gorgeous I've ever seen. I actually couldn't breathe in the moment and I still recall the moment exactly, starting with where he was and I was, what I was wearing, what he was wearing, our surroundings, etc. I'm not going to tell you it was love at first sight. It definitely wasn't. 

I just grew a crush on him.

Suddenly, I was flipping into chances to know him, to meet him, to be with him. I hung out with his friends and day by day, I got to know him better. Everything that I saw from the way he giggled instead of laughed to teasing his older brother on being shorter than him to his quiet eyes that scanned his surroundings to the way he could goof off and starting singing the Minions theme song but immediately become serious to his funny antics got me heading straight for the hills. The last straw for how I truly knew I loved him was when I saw him working day and night to achieve his dream  and nearly pass out.

I fell in love around three or four or five months into it. 

It's been two years guys. I have gotten to know him better and I have seen his flaws from his insecurities to his sometimes mean behavior to how superficial he can be to naive to being stupid to many other things that I can't say. They have ALL made me love him even more and I find myself excited, thrilled, positively beaming to find out more flaws and more secrets and more hidden stories that I find myself already holding a place in my heart to keep locked up. I fall deeper and deeper and deeper for him everyday and that love just grew bigger. He held me as I was crying, falling hard into my eating disorder and getting treatment and therapy to watching me get so angry I nearly broke everything in my house and he still held me. Guys, he stood by me when everyone left. He told me it was going to be okay, he made me feel loved and he made me smile when my parents told me to leave and how worthless I am. My sweet beautiful boy was there every single step of the way and all I pray now, all I beg of the world and God, is not to kiss him or hold his hands \[ which I also really want \] but to support him, to hold him when he is sad and be the first person he tells when he is happy, to hold his hands as he breaks and to stand by him and help him heal if he ever needs me. I want to take care of him when he is sick, give him massages when he is stressed, cheer the loudest when he accomplishes his dream, hug him after he has a bad day and so many things that I can't even begin to decipher. 

But he has a beautiful, talented, smart, nice girlfriend who can give him what he deserves.

I can't help but think he deserves an angel after seeing the boy who started bawling his eyes out when his friends were stressed and didn't get the job they wanted.

What do I do? Do I pursue him or leave him be? If I can support him and love him quietly from the sides as his best friend or even friend and if he truly loves her and she makes him happy, I will not interfere even though my heart shatters every time I think about it.",romance

"Well... It's somewhat misleading title, but I run dungeons and dragons games as a past time. This typically is met with not so enthusiasm to girls I try to pursue, and the ones who don't care usually have no interest in me.

My friend, we'll call him Gary, is a Cello player and so he sometimes goes to this place that is called Lil Violins or something like that. One day he decides to go while we are carpooling and geeks out over various things in store.

Well, the counter girl was really cute and helpful. Me being me, after a bit of time, started up conversation with her. We talked about books, games and movies. When DnD got brought up (I explained Im the DnD nerd and my friend is the music nut) she started asking questions about it.

Eventually Gary yells ""He's a dungeon master!"" which had her respond in pleading me to teach her. So I wrote my dungeon master alias, Skellie, along with my number on a sticky note and asked her to get in touch with me for a later meet up.

The next day she texted, and we scheduled a character creation date at a local game shop. We looked at dice, got to business, and of course got off track. We spent most of the day talking about other interests, random trivia we know, and watched random videos. This is very typical of DnD sessions done in person.

We ended up leaving there agreeing to meet wednesdays for sessions with Gary, but we couldn't do it that upcoming wednesday. So we instead scheduled a potential group bonding exercise and headed to the movies. Gary and friends all used the same excuse to bow out last minute, that they had work, so it was just violin girl and me.

Prior to us meeting, Gary told me that she was probably using dnd as an excuse to see me and she had a crush on me. I am completely clueless to these kinds of things, sooo.... I asked her directly. She didn't give me a straight answer until half way through the film, after noticing she was leaning one way, I told her she could lean on me. Instead of using me as a rest, we went in for the kiss. It was then that she admitted she ""might have a little crush on me.""

We are currently dating and have a dinner date upcoming. But man, I never expected DnD to be a catalyst for meeting my girl.

p.s. she is serious about learning dnd so we are continuing the dnd sessions.",romance

"WARNING - LONG POST

So my very significant other (also male) wants me to fulfil my promise of living next to him. 

The only problem is he's now married.

And yes, we have ~~already slept several times~~ a history together.

We were best friends and roommates when we were in uni. He was in Engineering and I was in Business Ad so we never had classes together, but apart from classes we were pretty much together every time. We were also very physical, you know, like holding hands, hugging, and stuff, which, frankly, are not unusual in this side of the planet. I mean they're not automatically signs of gayness. It was for me, but I was never sure if it was the same for him. 

I mean I liked him more than just a bro from the onset but I never really had the courage to confess to him nor to ask him about it. Although people like us enjoy a much more tolerating society compared to other Asian countries, it's still some sort of an unspoken taboo and most parents would tend to force their children to hide their non-heterosexuality.

Fast forward to our final year in school, he had  a girlfriend. As expected, the girlfriend was the overly jealous type and would complain about the amount of time V.S.O. and I would spend together. She would even read our chats in between classes and would sometimes confront me about why V.S.O. would say he loves me, or that his mom wants to cook dinner for me the coming weekend. It got to a point where she would call me and beg me to give V.S.O and her some time to spend together and I would always say yes to it, despite my broken heart. 

They got into a fight for some unknown reason and the next thing I know, she had one of her guy friends who also live in our dorm to take a picture of myself and V.S.O. cuddling while asleep I think you can guess what happened after that.

V.S.O. being the coward that he was, went on academic leave and flew to Canada to study English. I was left alone to handle the disaster of being outed to the whole school who felt like it was their business to know who I was sleeping with. 

It was hell walking through corridors and literally everyone in the cafeteria would stay away from the table where I would eat and they would whisper / talk about me being the gay dude who spread my gayness and converted someone's boyfriend / made someone queer...as if that's remotely possible!

&amp;#x200B;

It was too much and I contemplated suicide but luckily I found a job and my professors agreed to let me work, it was my final semester anyway, and I was only left with a handful of general education courses -- no major ones. They gave me D's and C's, but it was okay. At least I got out of school and successfully graduated.

&amp;#x200B;

I deleted my Facebook account and changed numbers and didn't have contact with him until after 2 years when we accidentally met in the subway near H.Y. university and I tried to run away from him but he ended up chasing me and we hugged and all the bad memories came back and I just cried and cried and cried.

We ended up having sex, for the first time, that night. It was amazing, probably because it felt like a confirmation that my feelings were actually reciprocated and that I didn't imagine all the memories I have of him.

This went on for a few months, I also had a boyfriend then, who I broke up with, FOR HIM!!!

Then he told me that his company decided to send him to the U.S. for a 5 year project (He works for a big car company) and that I should quit my job and join him there. I work for a big group of companies, though not as big as his, and I simply can't quit my job and blindly follow him to the U.S., right? 

So I decided against it and I don't know why but after that, I was never able to find a relationship that lasted for more than a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got a call from him 7 months later that he's coming home to get married and that he wanted me to be the best man. I was so offended by this that I cut contact with him again.

&amp;#x200B;

It's only this month that we established contact once again. We've had video call on Facebook for the longeeeest time and he was trying to convince me to come and join him again. He reminded me of our promise to live next to each other as we grow old. He said he still loves me and he wants to be with me. I believe that. But the problem is, he's married! I'm sure the wife doesn't even know about this side of him! I know that this is morally wrong so I really can't bring myself to say yes to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Sadly, however, I don't think I'll ever be able to find another significant other...

I feel like I should not be choosy and just accept this chance at being happy, even if it comes with a sh\*tty set of terms and conditions... what do you guys think? #HELPME",romance
"So we’re gonna call this guy “Jamal”. So Jamal (M/18) and me (F/19) and I go to the same college. 

I met him through mutual friends. I’m not the type to initiate conversation with people because I have social anxiety. And usually when people do come up and talk to me and look past my awkwardness, jts rare. So this Jamal always comes up and talks to me about anything he can think of or anything we have in common, doesn’t matter what it is he will talk to me. For example we had a class together so he would ask me if I thought the homework was hard or if I knew how to do anything, stuff like that. And whenever I’m with the friend that introduced me to him, he will greet me first then her so I noticed that too. 

During our first semester, I’d been having a lot of mental health issues and just needed a break so I stopped going to class, idk where I’d be If I hadn’t have stopped going. But yeah everyday he would ask where I am to another one of our mutual friends and he would always say he misses me. At the time he didn’t have anyway to contact me outside of seeing each other in person. I went up to campus one day to visit my friends bc like I said I stopped going and my mutual friend texted him and and let him know I was here and he came to where we were and he gave me the biggest hug ever and told me he missed me. We talked for a little and he left so I thought that was sweet of him  

Another thing is he’s always sooo excited and happy to see me like he’s always hella smiley when I’m around. I’m kind of the same way lol. 

Recently like 3 days ago, me my two mutual friends and him all hung out. We went out for food and had a good time. That day is when i realized I like him. Idk what it was but we finally got to talk together and have some space from everyone and it was just us and we kinda clicked in my opinion. We were laughing the whole time. One of the friends that was with us pulled me aside and we went to the bathroom bc girls go to the br together lol but she was basically saying how she thinks he likes me and how since day one she’s been waiting for us to get together and stuff and she said the chemistry is there... she’s not wrong at all. And sometimes I noticed we would play fight like flirting a little. 

I didn’t even realize I liked him til that day tbh, but everything added up. Every time I we text I would kind of get nervous and wonder why now I know. Whenever I see him in person I get excited and I always want to hug him. And I genuinely think he’s such a sweetheart, he accepts me for who I am, I know that bc he actually took the tome to get to know me and get through the awkwardness, most people just think I’m weird and shy and rude so they stop talking to me but he didn’t do that... I guess he saw something in me? and he’s really cute and tall...❤️

One of our mutual friends told me “he likes you” and I asked him “did he say the three words?? I like (my name)” he said “well he said he enjoys your company and he says he misses you all the time, and he thinks you’re funny.” And that’s just not clear at all, that could mean anything. 

But let me get into why I’m unsure of his feelings for me... he’s friends with A LOT of people. And A LOT of girls... maybe I’m just one of those girls that he befriended. And when we first started knowing each other he asked me if I had any friends for him to date and he asked if one of my friends was single and stuff... and that moves me onto me not being his type. His type is “black and pretty” in his words. He even asked me if I could give him one of my friends number and they look NOTHING like me. I’m not the prettiest as I’m not hella skinny either. I don’t really wear makeup that often either so I just don’t know. 

So basically I just don’t know... I kind of just wanna come out and tell him straight on that I like him and why kind of like “confessing my love” except I don’t love him lol. but I don’t wanna ruin our friendship if things go south or if he just doesn’t feel the same. Honestly If one of our mutual friends could tell him and get his reaction I would be good. I would either stop hanging out where they dorm if he doesn’t like me OR I would come and hang out all the time if he does. Can someone help me know the best way to go about this? Thanks. ❤️",romance

We[20MF] have been in a rough LDR for 3 years. First 2 years went good with a bit of fights but it has been down road since then. 

We almost broke up since my gf [20F] wanted me to change and be better with her because I’ve hurt her emotionally so much but she still gave me another chance at the end of the year.

It’s been a week since then and she’s feeling like we’re being the same again. She told me she’s giving me a chance so I grow up, Change myself and become more mature and self aware. I took it serious but I didn’t know how to show her all that. 

She complained again 4 days ago that I’m not even trying anything. To make her feel happy or to even make her want me anymore even though she doesn’t feel much for me now. 

I really love her so much but I don’t know how to express that to her without really saying because she’s more of a person who prefers to see things happening that show efforts and that I am trying for her and us. But I don’t know what to do. 

Secondly, she’s been asking me to talk about something for 4 days since she’s been so frustrated with her family crises. And I don’t know what exactly to talk to her about. She says she talks to me and hopes to relax from all the stress and all but I only add up more to it. 


She keeps asking me to talk about something and if I do, all I can think about is talking about my problems or her problems or complimenting her or talking related to my family and she likes none of those to talk about because my family particularly doesn’t like her so much. 

So I want to ask is, what do I talk to her about when she says, “Talk about something else.” But doesn’t feel interested in these topics and says I talk boring things only. 

Please advice me on this or hint me what I should be doing? And sorry about the long post. 

TL;DR We [20MF] have nothing to talk about and my gf finds things boring that I talk about and wants me to talk about something else all the time and I don’t know what to really talk to her about. What should I talk about? Give some advice.",romance

"Lack of sex leading to depression?

I admittedly have only had sex once,back when I was an 18 year old guy(I’m 21 right now) and it was awful, like I don’t have anything fond to say about it. Just to give you guys some background. I don’t date either. If It matters I’m a guy.

One of my friends went out last night, and she told me that she got drunk and had some kickass sex with someone, and she came a lot... etc etc.

"It was a cold day in January and I remember I had a date with a guy whom I met online . I wasn’t particularly keen on the guy , but he seemed fun and I though I had nothing to lose.
We went to this bar in central London and had a chat . It was an ok date , but I didn’t feel like it. I was polite enough to stay for few hours and talk to the guy . 

Around 10pm I decided that it was time to go home and call it a night. We said our goodbyes and I headed to the nearest tube station . I remember being slightly tipsy and just enjoying listening to music when at the next stop he got on . 

He is very tall , very sporty / athletic looking ,has piercing blue eyes and a dark hair . He definitely got my attention, but I tried not to stare . Girls stare at him a lot when we are out . 😂

I remember I smiled at him , he smiled back , but I never really have my hopes up since London is not a place where people chat you up . Anyway he sat next to me, I instantly felt some crazy energy between us , but I knew my stop was coming so I stood up to get off .

I sensed a tap and there is he asking if I can give him my number. He was quite drunk , so I didn’t know what to make of it . I gave him my number and later on I got a text from him :

Hey nice to meet you I’m so and so . I will text you tomorrow . Have a good night .

I replied back and said goodnight .

The next day he messaged me which was nice . I learnt that he was from New York , but his mum was English, he moved here recently and wanted to start a fresh . New York was too much for him . In a sense I know why he feels that way . When I visited New York I found it hectic and a strange city .

We decided to meet the following week. It was easy since we both work in central London , so it was convenient for both of us .

We met at a bar near Tower Hill.  I was surprised that he was more than a good looking guy . I have met quite few good looking guys , but they were very basic. I felt they relied on their looks not their personality. However he was different, he was funny ( still is ) , he was intelligent and quirky . 

We bounded over love for travelling , video games , history , philosophy. 

It was a real change. We had few drinks ( there went my dry January resolution). We kissed and I went home . 

We went on a second date few days later and since then we have been together.

It’s been 3 years and I still get butterflies when I see him . We live together now and plan to get married next year . 

I can’t say it’s been all roses . We’ve had our moments , but I truly feel we get each other and can overcome whatever comes our way .

So this is my story .",romance
"So I’ve been dating this guy for about 6 months, and we have been having plenty of sex. We both tested negative the last time we got tested. I got tested before having sex with him and tested negative. He got tested before we started talking, and he also tested negative. 

Here’s the thing: we are planning on getting tested again, but he suggested to start using condoms after getting tested together. We already had the talk about keeping things exclusive and decided to explore our romantic and sexual interest monogamously. Given that we both haven’t been using condoms since we started having sex and we’re not seeing other people, I find it odd that he would suggest that now. To me, it implies that he might have sex with other people or that he’s worried that I might. There’s already a sentimental value to not using condoms aside from the fact that it feels better. We already spoke about this, and how that made me feel.

I’m aware that a person can catch an STD through other means; he doesn’t do drugs, for instance, and I don’t think he will engage in any sexual contact with another person (kissing, oral etc) 

Btw, we’re both gay men.

"Theres this mutual friend who recently became part of our group and I've always kind of noticed that whenever he says hi or bye, he gets all awkward with me like he tries to hug me but I just give him a handshake cause I don't know him like that yet.

He tends to get all googly eyed around me, like once my sister and I had our car parked in front of  of church and he saw us through the window, so he came outside, opened the front car door (I was in the passenger seat) and he tried to get in, like just being silly.
After that it started to develop more into something obvious. Our car started to have issues so I asked around who knows how to work on cars and they said that he does. So even though he was sick, his sister told me that he would be on his way to take a look at the car. He came and when I opened the door, his face was all red and like an awkward ""hi"" lol.
The next day we saw each other at church and he kept asking if I still needed someone to look at the car and I said don't worry about it if your sick, my dad could find someone, but he would just insist.
Before I had to go look for my seat, he said to me btw that dress looks really nice.
After church was over, I was talking to someone else and I could just see him from the outside smiling directly at me. I was leaving through the door, and I didn't notice he was holding the door open, then he said bye (my name) and he just followed me to my car and tried to talk some more and still kept telling me to let him know if I need a car mechanic.
Days later, they all went out to eat as a group and once my mom and sister got there, he asked them out loud ""where is (my name)?"" and they replied to him ""oh she's sick at home she couldn't come"" 
My mom said herself she thinks he likes me, and she is always right about these things, also it's a known fact that moms always know lol.",romance

There is a distinct possibility that for every person finding your soul mate is different. I seem to like women that are happy and easy-going. Probably this is a result of my childhood. Growing up in a home that had a lack of love and light, with ridged structure and no warmth. Maybe I crave the affection of someone who is able to adjust and deal with the insecurities of my personality. Someone who is able to fill the crevices of my dark soul with sunshine. Apparently these people are attracted to literally everyone else because I haven't found a single person that is out there who is not already happy and taken with another man. So... I wait.....",romance
"So I’ve been dating this guy for about 5 months. We have gone on multiple days, had sex, talked about personal stuff, and he’s very affectionate. Our conversations are always productive, and we do communicate a lot. I usually see him twice every two weeks

There are a few things I’m concerned about, and I’m not sure where this is going, or he’s just using me for his own convenience or if he’s talking to someone else. Keep in mind that I’m always there for him when he’s depressed and needs someone to talk to and someone who listens. 

I started feeling insecure about things fairly recently, and it’s not because of things I made up in my mind; it’s because of things I have noticed while spending time with him and talking over WhatsApp.

I started feeling like this when we went out on a date this past December to Washington Square Park. I noticed a conversation he was having with another guy. They were calling each other baby and papi and sending each other the kissing emoji. I brought this up to him immediately and demanded an explanation. He told me that’s how he shows affection to friends, and I told him that I find that disrespectful because he’s with me, and he shouldn’t be calling other people like that because it could be easily interpreted. One, I will think he’s talking to other people, and two, since we’re discreet (I’ve only met his family, but he introduced me as a friend, and I haven’t met his friends, and I’d really like to), his friends and acquaintances don’t know abt us, so him calling them like will think he’s available.  We talked abt it, and he agreed to remain using those terms with me only. I told that those terms are special to me, and that should only be used among the two of us.

Few days after, he wanted me to accompany him to the hospital. When he was asked for his social security, he had a picture of it saved on his phone. As he was looking for it on his photo albums, he noticed I was looking and then proceeded to turn around so I wouldn’t see and he smiled. This was the third time he did it, and out of respect, I never asked because I wanted to respect his privacy. He also does this when answering messages from friends and acquaintances; not family members. After leaving the hospital, I brought it up to him, and I asked him why he acts suspicious when answering messages on social media and looking through his photo albums. He told me he has pornography of his friends on his phone saved, but said this was before us, and that he will delete him, which according to him he did after that convo. He began to answer messages of his friends next to me but I saw him deleting convos on WhatsApp. He agreed that things could be misinterpreted, and we talked about it.

I’ve been insisting in meeting his friends and people he hangs out with. He said that he will, but never does. For me, meeting his friends is important, and at times, I feel like he’s hiding me and doesn’t want people to know. For example, today, he was hanging out with his acquaintances at their place because they were having a party. I FaceTimed him exactly at 12am to wish him a happy 2020. We talked for a bit. It was a bit loud inside but he walked out from the apartment so he could hear me better. I asked him to send me kisses over FaceTime multiple times to test something. He was facing the door of the apartment, which was open, and there were people by the door. Every time I asked him he would turn around, having his back facing the door to hide his kisses. I also told him to introduce to his friends right there and then but he didn’t want to. 

A lot of other stuff have happened but these are the major ones. I don’t know what to do or what to think. A friend of mine told me that’s he’s using me for his convenience, for sex, etc without compromising. 

Any thoughts?",romance
"I don't know what to do guys..

There's a really special guy I like, who even invited me to his birthday (his birthday was some days ago idk if u care lol). I told him, that I don't want to go because I don't really like anyone there beside him. When he realized, that I won't come, he invited 3 of my friends (not my besties, just some friends we share) but none of them came. Because I didn't knew, that one of them ain't coming, I went to his birthday.. and it was reallyy weird for me. Later on, when we chatted on WhatsApp I told him that I really tried it because of him and he answered: aww. 

In the winter break we plan to meet up but I'll wait for him to ask me, because I already did twice (he did it once, but when we had a lil fight so it didn't worked out). 2 and a half years ago I confessed my feelings for him, but back then I was 12 and he didn't like me back but in general we just weren't ready for anything serious at this point. I told him in June 2017, but after March 2018 we lost contact, as we started fighting.  After I had been in another relationship and other stuff happened, we got in contact again on our class trip in September 2019.

In october I asked him to meet up and we went to another city, where we had a really great time and we also talked about how sad it was that we lost contact and how nice it is, that we are back at spending time together again. Since 2 weeks we chat very often about different random stuff and nowadays he ain't ignoring my flirt attempts on whatsapp and he even sends the blushing emoji and aww like in the example.

Some other day I told him, that I'm scared to be as annoying as one other girl, who he dislikes, he told me that it's definitely not likely to happen. 

So he isn't really avoiding my flirt attempts and he also always tries to make me feel good about myself, but I don't know if he does this because of love or friendship..

My best friend says I should wait, before I tell him, because if I don't, even if he is developing feelings, he will be confused what to answer. I understand where she's coming from, but I don't want to wait to long, because the longer I'll wait, the more rejection will hurt.

So should I wait, before I tell him and if so, for how long?

"TL;DR: Guy from my filmclass keeps running up to me after class to have short conversations. My intuition tells me that he might be interested in me but I’m not too sure. I’m definitely developing feelings for him and even dreaming about him a lot. (M&amp;F18)


I apologize for the poor grammar, English is not my mothertongue. 

I’ll start with some background information to explain the situation. Twice a week I go to filmclass, we discuss and learn about film technique. The lessons are on Tuesdays, and on Fridays. On Tuesdays it’s the first lesson of the day, and on Fridays it’s the last lesson of the day and I go home after it. 

Film is my biggest interest and so I chose this class even though I didn’t know anybody there. I just sit quietly, listen to the teacher, mind my own business and then leave quickly whenever class finishes. From the very first lesson, I noticed that the majority of the students who had chosen this class only chose it because it had a rumour of being one of the easier classes, with no real interest of film which kinda disappointed me. Although there was one group of 3 guys who I could tell were clearly interested in the subject. One of those guys in particular caught my eye, I’ll call him Mike. First time I noticed him was on the second lesson of the semester when I came running into the class late and sat almost infront of him, with my back slightly turned to him. I noticed how he was staring at my No Face key ring and how he kept looking at me. I didn’t think much of it at the time and forgot about it since I thought it was irrelevant. 

A month or two later, we’re assigned to hold a presentation on any movie we want. Since I didn’t know any of the students in that class, I was one of the few students who held the presentation alone. I was pretty nervous but it turned out alright. This was on a Friday. When class finished, I went to my locker, got my jacket and started walking out of school while listening to music through my headphones. I could slightly hear somebody walking behind me, and then I heard a voice shouting ”hey! hey you!” multiple times. I didn’t turn around at first, but then I felt a hand on my shoulder and I turned around and saw that it was Mike. He complimented my presentation as we continued walking together, saying that it was great and we even discussed the movie. We walked together and chatted for about one minute, then we reached a crossing and went seperate paths. I felt an immense sense of ”euphoria” (!?) and I was just completely overwhelmed by that interaction. I kept thinking about it nonstop for a couple of days. Since then, he has walked up to me in the same way 3 more times. It’s always the same; me walking away from school, and him running up to me to chat for a bit as we walk. We never talk during class because we never get the chance to, so on Fridays I always look forward to hopefully getting to see him and chat with him. When we walk past each other in school we both smile widely and just quickly say hi. 

I’ve gotten the feeling that he might be interested in me, but I’ve been overthinking it way too much. I asked a male friend, and he said that this is the behaviour of a guy that wants to initiate contact with a girl that he’s interested in. My male friend pointed it out especially since I was wearing headphones on multiple occasions and that Mike still walked up to me. My friend meant that you wouldn’t walk up to somebody from class that’s wearing headphones if you weren’t interested in them, especially since we live in Sweden - a country where no strangers walk up to each other, ever. I want to believe my friend, but I’m not sure. I don’t want to blow a small interaction out of proportion. 

And to be honest, each time me and Mike have talked I’ve been a bit ”off” and I don’t think I’ve shown much interest which I’m scared might drive him away. I just didn’t want to seem too excited to talk to him, even though I was. 

Basically, my intuition is telling me that he might be interested in me and that has driven me completely insane. Thing is, my intuition is usually correct and people that I have felt some kind of vague ”connection” with before have always ended up being valid (an example is that I matched with the guys that I had been having constant eyecontact with from school on tinder). I feel SO drawn to him. My eyes search for him everywhere I go. It’s crazy because if you’d add up the total time of our conversations, it would barely be 5 minutes and I’m not the type at all to feel like this. It’s a bit embarrassing to admit but I’ve even dreamt about him atleast 4-5 times this month. I wouldn’t have a problem with taking the first step and adding him on social media or asking him if he’d want to go to the movies together IF I was more sure that he actually was interested. Am I totally blowing this out of proportion? Do you think that these vague interactions are enough to determine whether or not he’s interested in me? Is it worth to spend this much energy thinking about it?",romance
"I remember a time when I knew I fell in love. I knew it was love because at this moment I felt something I had never felt in anyone. I remember I looked at this women when she her hair was messy, her makeup was messed up and her clothes were dirty and I felt something so powerful that words cannot even explain. Even with all the things that’s happened In the past I still feel have that powerful feeling when I look at you. When I look into your eyes they make my heart melt and cause the world to pause as if It can stop time and allow me to save that moment forever. When I see her smile I see my world light up with fireworks. Now with the things that’s happened I cannot look at you in the eyes anymore, the pain my heart feels knowing it has been mislead. My heart feels as if it has been beaten by drums and torn into a billion pieces. My love, my best friend, my world, how could you? How could you let someone think they have finally won your heart but take it all back? Take back all those words, take back those actions, take back everything that gave me hope. You know I saw yesterday and you know how I felt? I felt that same powerful feeling. My heart is shattered and yet it still manages to feel love. You ask me why I can’t move on and this is why.. you’re the only person I want to be with. 

Sincerely, 

Your forever and always",romance
"She’s such a sweetheart, we’ve had so many laughs and so much fun, and we’re so attracted to each other. I have trouble imagining my life without her and I want her to be happy. Trouble is, we’re both broken. 

I’ve been trying to better myself, but it’s been really hard for me. I was unemployed for several years after graduating high school because I struggled with anxiety and depression. I finally took a fast food job, and I feel like I barely make enough money to survive on my own, if I had an apartment with a roommate. I’ll be going back to school in the spring to learn welding, though.

She’s currently unemployed (recently lost her job with my employer) and abuses her body with alcohol and cigarettes. She also smokes weed and occasionally uses psychedelics. She struggles with social anxiety because her mother emotionally abused her, and is deeply depressed because two of her boyfriends died young. She constantly wants to hurt herself and wants to die, but keeps reassuring me she won’t kill herself. She doesn’t eat much, so she’s tiny and usually low on energy. She thinks she’s going to die young from substance abuse, and so do I. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve imagined her death and cried.

I don’t know what to do. She occasionally beats around the bush about marriage, but also tells me she won’t marry me because she considered her recently-departed boyfriend her “husband”, and hasn’t broken off their relationship in her heart. She also sometimes talks about “disappearing”, meaning leaving town with friends to start a new life somewhere out there. I don’t believe she could survive on her own, since she hasn’t learned to be a functional adult, but I’m sure I don’t make enough money to take care of her as a housewife.

My mind and pretty much all my friends tell me it’s a bad idea to be romantically-involved with her, but sometimes it feels like she’s my heart living outside of my body. This is the most painful dilemma I’ve ever been faced with.",romance

"I figured I could post some of my romantic thoughts on here

I have this girl that really loves me, she's very sweet, kind, funny, a bit childish but very loving. I fantasize of making her the happiest girl in the world. 

I love being passionate, I love being romantic and I love being infatuated. I fantasize about sitting next to her inside a cabin, were sitting on the floor. The lights are off with the exception of the chimney fire and some dimmed lights comming from the lamps. The carpet is red, she's leaning next to me, we have a blanket covering us. I'm holding her gently, making her feel wanted, special, safe, and treasured. Cuddling and petting her, I smile and I kiss her, I stare into her eyes and tell her how much I love her. This next part might sound cheesy, but I also want to buy her some expensive chocolate and feed them to her(side note, I've told her this and she laughed 😂)

I also fantasize about taking her out to a fancy restaurant, I would wear an expensive tux with some some accessories and she'd wear a lovely dress and get her hair done. Our hearts skipping beats the moment we see each other, completely and and utterly overwhelmed with desire and passion. The table will have red covering with candles at the table and a bottle of champagne. We would stare at each other intimately while I gently put my glass of champagne on her lips and she does the same, our elbows touching and lips smiling while we wait for the waiter.

This one is more of her fantasy, but I'll include it here since I do desire to make her feel infatuated. I want to have a slow dance with her, but the night has to be perfect. The moon is outside, as big and yellow as can be. It is drizzling and romantic melodies are playing, however, I am holding her, our hearts are beating and the moment overtakes us. I lean in and kiss her neck a couple of time and then her lips, she presses her hands on my chest and I hold her lower back gently. Simply there, being for her and giving her what she's always wanted",romance

"Hey! So recently I met a guy through a friend of mine. At first, I didn’t really really pick an interest on him. However, after meeting with him thrice, I noticed that I grew some feelings for him. The big major problem is that I can’t find an opportunity to talk to him alone and to meet with him alone since he is always with his guy friends including my friend. He is not rly a social media guy so it makes it even harder to have a one on one conversation with him. Also, he is super kind, but now I’m starting to think that he is overly kind and it kinda builds some barriers between us. Is it worth pursuing this ? Or should I just give up on anything romantic with him ?",romance

"Three days ago my stepmom had a Christmas party for her ESL class. One of her classmates brought her kids to the event, one of which is only three years younger than me. We enjoyed each other's company, listening to music, eating the food, and what was watching a movie becoming playing Crash Bandicoot with the younger ones (I don't think she's touched a platformer before; I was the only one getting somewhere). She even used my phone to play my music after I paused it. When she was about to leave, I wanted to share her the song, but I was hesitant about asking for her number (ignore my lack of knowledge of airdrop), but she took my phone and gave me her number. I helped put some chairs in her car as the party was over, and she left. Layer yesterday, I sent a text, but she hasn't really yet.

This is the first time something like this has happened to me, so I don't know if there's hope. Any ideas?",romance

"So last night I was hanging out with my friend. (A bit of background: she knows that I've been wanting to have my first kiss and such, she's offered before to kiss but I wasn't sure if it was serious or not) When she started driving me home, we played truth or truth like the teenagers we are. She asked if I'd ever done anything intimate and when I said no she was surprised (""Really? Not even romantic hand holding?""). She asked why, and I said because no one was offering other than horny juniors. She asked if I'd like her to teach me how to kiss so I said sure.
A few minutes later we pull into a parking lot and she's really sweet about it; making sure I'm comfortable with it and such. And then (surprise!!) we kiss.
I just don't know if this is a romantic thing or just a pals helping out pals thing. I've never really been in a relationship before so I'm pretty dumb when it comes to these things lol.

TLDR; my friend (who knows I've been wanting to have my first kiss) offered to teach me how to kiss. we did. im unsure whether this was romantic or platonic.",romance
"This is the first time I've ever been in a relationship, so forgive my inexperience :'(

Some guy recently confessed his feelings to me. I reciprocated them, and then he asked me out for a date. I'm so terrified, and in my fear, I may have had some sort of crisis. 

Now that I've really had some time to myself, I realized that my feelings have started to fade away, and that I kind of lost them. What if I don't actually like this person, and I only like the feeling of falling in love? Have I romanticized relationships to the point where I'm so desperate for someone to love me even though I don't see any future with them?

However, it might be too late because word has spread (thanks to me and my inability to keep my mouth shut for more than one minute) and now everyone is rooting for the both of us. I don't know if I'm ready or not, or if I'll ever be ready, and I don't want to do anything that I might regret in the future.  I also don't want to hurt myself or the other person, and it's kind of pathetic to end something before it even starts because I have cold feet. 

I really don't know what to do, so I'm trusting a bunch of strangers on the internet for help.

"We both skateboard and we met thru mutuals who also skateboard, it’s a big skate community out here.  Never once really found her attractive or would even classify her as my type so I just never really looked her way plus also she’s gay/bi. She eventually got a job at my work and we both hit it off immediately. She was funny, very easy to get along with, and just a really nice energy to be around. We talked about girls, music, skating and all the good stuff. Again I never really thought of it as anything, until the idea of me and her together popped in my head. At first I was like no way, she’s like a sister to me and it was just weird. But then I thought that if I were to date someone, they would have to be exactly like her. And the more we worked together the more I thought about it and the more I felt myself having some kind of emotional/romantic feeling for her. Now we text each other songs and stupid memes and stuff like that. Cute shit. We had a holiday work party recently and she had asked me to come to her house before so we could go together. I’m stoked. Idk why but us going to the party together felt like a foreshadowing of a possible relationship. So we’re at the party, it’s been about an hour, drinks are flowing, everyone havin a good time. She eventually makes her way over to me. At this point it’s now or never, so I kinda drunkenly brush my face against her cheek and kinda gage her reaction to it. She looks at me and says “kiss?” And I was like yeah, so then we kissed. And then she told me to do it again, so I did. My night was made in that moment. But she then reiterated to me that she was gay after the kiss which kinda sucked but I knew this so I respected it. Our first work shift together after the party was kinda awkward and we were both kinda stand offish. Now I’m just stuck here with feelings for someone that will  probably not reciprocate them back. It’s weird because she always used to tell me she liked dudes too, so like should I keep pursuing this or just let it go??",romance
"So my s/o (25M) and I (20F) have been dating since April. I'm extroverted and goofy and human embodiment of a golden retriever puppy. He's introverted, sarcastic, and endearing. We're both meganerds.

We hadn't said 'I love you' yet, but I knew it was a matter of time. I've been ready since the summer but was letting him say it first because I didn't want to pressure him. I didn't mind too much that he hadn't said it because he genuinely showed me he did every day, and we had our own little phrase that I came to learn was his way of saying it, ""You're the best.""

The other week we were talking about his inability to be 100% serious (he used the word sincere) ever. Like even the most sincere moments had to have some tinge of sarcasm to them. He used ""You're the best"" as an example, but didn't explicitly say that he meant it as ily.

So Niagara. We've been on 2 trips before this one. One camping, and the other a trip to New Hampshire and Maine. Niagara was us two, his friend, and her boyfriend.

I'd been telling my friends that if he doesn't say it on this trip, I'd square up (jokingly). Normally it wouldn't bother me where/when it happened but I am a hopeless romantic and our origin story was certainly not a meet cute (tinder) so I wanted one really nice story.

So we're at the falls after an extremely long day. Its dark and raining. We're looking out over the water at the fireworks. He asks me ""So is it everything you wanted?""

I respond, ""There's just one brief moment of sincerity I'm missing,"" with a grin.

We stare at eachother for a moment. He kisses me and pulls apart and says ""I love you"".

I say, ""I love you, too.""

Welp turns out this dumbass has been ready to say it since late August/early September and the only reason he didn't say it on our trip to NH was we were both super stressed cause we got trapped on the mountains, plus he knew I was super excited for Niagara.

The next day at a museum we had this conversation:
Him: so how hard was it to not say?
Me: you'll see soon enough how often I wanna say it, still trying to ease into it for you
Him: I know what I'd unleash when I said it. I'm at a point in my life where I don't throw it around willy nilly, I'm in it for the long haul
Me: *cries*

Okay yeah, that's all. It was super sweet and I'm really so fucking happy it's not even funny.",romance

"So this situation is that my husband and I have been married for almost 15 years now and we started our lives together in a pretty rough spot.. Rough as in didn't have a home to call our own, making just over $1,000 per month between the 2 of us and me very pregnant.. The ring my husband proposed to me with was an opal his mom gave him that was waaaayyy too big for my finger and couldn't afford to resize. We purchased our wedding rings off of Ebay for maybe $60 for the set--his and hers.

We busted our asses to do better financially--I continued with school while staying home with our son and my husband continued to become more successful in the automotive industry. Fast forward a decade later and we've gone from barely scraping by to making well over $100,000 per year and our son not knowing what it's like to be in need. So doing pretty well 

Around our 12th anniversary, my husband had dropped clues that he was going to get me a ring--of course I had shown him the styles that I preferred any time we were in a jewelry store. However, when he finally presented me with his chosen ring on our Anniversary it was nothing like I had shown him... in fact, it was almost the opposite.. I was disappointed but also really really hurt. But I wore it happily for him even though it made me sad. And it made me sad and upsate every day I wore it and saw it on my finger because it felt like he bought this ring without really thinking of me..

Fast forward to now. I had been online ""window shopping"" for rings and shared 5 or so different styles that I loved with my husband. He didn't have much of a response, so I asked him if it bothered him at all that I was looking at rings and he said no--note: some time around 2018 I finally told him that I wasn't very happy with the ring and that I thought he would have picked out something more like what I'd shown him; this lead to a guilt trip. So I ended up buying a ring that I absolutely love about a week ago. A natural opal surrounded by diamonds. It reminded me of when he proposed to me when we literally had nothing and how far we've come. 

So we were out Christmas shopping earlier today, which reminded me of the ring I bought so I tell him about it. He proceeded to get angry with me, took his wedding band off and now won't speak to me. He told me how much I had hurt his feelings since the ring he got me ""wasn't good enough"" and told me to at least give him the other ring back so he could return it. I reminded him that I had told him that the ring he picked wasn't what I liked and that when I asked if he minded that i was looking at other rings he had said no. It was basically at that point that he stopped talking to me and wouldn't even look at me.

Did I completely misread the situation? Should I have just kept my mouth shut and grinned and beared it despite feeling hurt? Should I have just waited patiently after another decade passed..?",romance

So I went to my grandma and asked her what she thought of the flowers. She says ""So he comes back from the store with those and I think oh no he's really done it now. Because you know men from our generation only buy flowers when the're apologizing. And I told him I did't want them you know they get all rotted and mushy. So I put them in the back yard for the trash collector but then I thought well there already here  so I put them in the vase"" ""So do you like them?"" I asked ""yes they are pretty"" she said.

" Random question. So here's my incredibly uninteresting story behind it. Typical American guy- start dating in high school, have a few gfs here and there, get laid every so often. Go to college same thing. Go on dates, occasionally get into some sort of quasi relationship. However, most of the women I went out with I felt were not of high substance. For dual credit Spanish college courses, I traveled to Panama one summer with a group of students and stayed with a host family. I met a girl 2 days after arriving, and we dated the whole summer. It was magical. We never did more than make out, but the kissing &amp; making out was 10/10, out of this world, very physically compatible. We would go on dates, and always have fun together. We had great conversations. She was genuinely interested in me as a person. She never asked me for anything. she always made time for us to hang out/go on dates. This was years ago now, but I always wonder about it. How could I not find anyone in 20+ years here, but in TWO days, I was able to meet such a remarkable woman (who is probably married to some lucky bastard now)? Is this whole romance/love thing all just luck? All opinions are welcomed.",romance

"So around June-ish 2017, a girl confessed she liked me and I said why the hell not (figuratively) we've been talking for the fast year and cracked jokes and were casual with each other (online, we were not very comfortable talking to each other too much publicly because of friends and stuff not that we had negative friends but just that it was weird). We agreed on keeping this like a secret bf/gf thing. It's been a while and apparently like 5 of her friends found out (idk i still tease her on be a bad secret keeper because of it lol). So being fair I told a friend of mine I can trust (female, idk I felt like it was important to include) because I owe her for tuning my instrument (for like the past year).  
I just wanted to tell someone.

also, I'm not an adult (18+).

"Update: 22 hours later, I made another post but here’s what I did so far on my own. He’s an extremely shy, nervous, and very anxious dude. He has a really bad anxiety that over comes him. He’s only nervous, acts weird, and freaks out over first dates. I legit just want him to be upfront and just either tell me why he’s afraid or just afraid to tell me he’s not interested. I mean he’s the one who asked me out. I actually have been trying to warm up to him so many times and let him feel more comfortable around me lol. Yesterday, I got him to get to know me a bit and I saw that he started to slowly feel comfortable talking. I told him that I was still interested and that I accepted his offer because I felt like we had a real connection with him and that I wouldn’t judge him at all.  I gave him at least 2 paragraphs explaining everything that I felt connection, thar he shouldn’t be afraid to be nervous, why I wouldn’t judge him. I told him a few things we were talking about that I had remembered and used them as examples that I never judged him for what he does. I pretty much motivated him a bit that everyone feels nervous over a lot of things and not just him. I explained that I’m also a nervous for people to judge me for being a weird, childish person, and I’ve also stated that sometimes it’s okay to feel nervous about being judged, because you do something you love to do and that you shouldn’t really listen to people. I’ve pretty much convinced him that I haven’t judged him at all, but his only responses I got after my speech were  “ ☺️,” “❤️,” “  something something &amp; I really love how you remember everything,” and the last one to my question is “Is that a yes question?”  His response was “ Maybe real soon idk why I’m freaking out.” Other than that I was just curious what he meant by “ Maybe real soon idk why I’m freaking out,” or those emojis?",romance
"So idk why I’m posting this but I just needed to tell someone this story that is making me feel like I’m in a movie lol. So basically I used to work at a certain clothing store and this guy got hired a little while after me. I didn’t really think much of him besides the fact that we were good work friends and shot the shit a lot. He had a girlfriend and was not totally my type so I didn’t even picture him that way. After a few months I left the store to move on to another job. He still works there though and we both have a great relationship with the other people that work there. So the other day he asks me out of nowhere (like I haven’t spoken to him in maybe 6 months) whether or not I wanna come to the store’s Christmas party with him and see everyone. So I say yeah that sounds fun and go. All night he is being kinda flirty with me but I guess I’m kinda dim cause I still didn’t think much of it until at the end of the night he say we should totally get drinks some time. To which I was like yeah that would be great, the only problem is (and here is the kicker) I am moving in less than a week half way across the country. So I tell him this and he says he wants to get dinner and drinks regardless. So we make a plan for like 3 days later. Which was tonight. We went to a couple bars I had never been to before and had an amazing time. We then walked down to the boardwalk in our little east cost town where there are hammocks and he finally kissed me. We ended up making out a bit and chatting in between. We mostly spoke about how sad it is that we feel like this could be so great if only I weren’t leaving and his timing wasn’t so bad. We both are on career paths that we know are never going to be stable or in one place. So we walk up to where I have to get my bus home and are making out in the bus stop and he is saying such sweet things to me that I tear up a little. I shit you not this felt surreal. Then the bus comes and we have this dramatic goodbye kiss and now I doubt I’ll see him and again for a long time even though he told me to keep in touch. I know this is not really a question or anything but I just wanted to share because it feels a little crazy right now. Almost like star crossed lovers lol. Anyone else have a crazy story like this?",romance

All I got was “ It is possible.” So I asked him if he was super nervous on the day I was suppose to have a date, but he  apologized that he gets weirded out over first dates. I mean we ended on a good note on Monday with wishing each other good luck on studying. He’s been extremely acting nervous, anxious, and shy around me lately on Wednesday and Tuesday. So I don’t really know what I’m suppose to do, but I do know is I have give him space and make him make a move. I’m kind of upset, but is is what it is lol",romance

"This is sorta kinda an update to my other post thing: [Please say he doesn't like me](https://www.reddit.com/r/romance/comments/e277pq/please_say_he_doesnt_like_me/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

He really likes me

Wait

What?

**Here's the story or somethin:**

There was a party at my place and well... He can be a socially anxious dumbo, so he just decided to go for a stroll in an UNKNOWN NEIGHBORHOOD, a GHETTO neighborhood. For the record... He was drunk. Veeeery drunk. 

I run after him (cuz duh, he's walking around and singing ring of fire without a jacket on, it was freezing cold) 

I get to him in time, convince him to go back, only to then take a stroll together with jackets on this time.

We went to a park thingy, and literally just cuddled on an ice cold bench. 

I remember hearing him talk about how he likes me... Like, reeeeally likes me. I then felt his face get way too close for comfort to mine and right after, boom, a kiss. A drunk, bad, sloppy kiss. His first kiss, his first kiss that happened with his crush on an ice cold bench in a ghetto neighborhood.

So yeah, as it turns out, he was head over heels for me for about three weeks at that moment I think. 

And that kiss made me consider all I thought about before... But the question ""do I like him?"", disappeared immediately, I did. I liked this guy who is trying to be an asshole but is just too goddamn nice to people, this guy who is a massive nerd, this guy with jokes so bad they're good, this guy who gives probably the best hugs ever, this guy who can't kiss for shit. This guy right... Goddamn I love how cute he can be. 

He kind of sobered up and we talked a bit about how we couldn't decide anything while laying on a cold bench, drunk, so he'd stay over the day after so we could talk shit out.

When we came back there were people talking about shit. Shit like;""You've focked"" and ""You are SUcH a cOUpLe""

So we ran away again

To kiss and stuff

When one of the dudes left the party he straight up pointed at the guy and said:""You better have s*x tonight""

And well, we didn't, but in the morning we made out and he stayed over for the rest of the day and like

We are now

A couple

We're both still really confused as to how it all happened, but the most important thing is that it's pretty nice",romance

"Long story short, I got involved in a relationship that burned with too much white-hot intensity to survive and it fizzled out on a sour note. Now that I am single again, I am trying to live my life and just do things make me happy. One of those things include spending time with my friends. And I have this one guy friend in particular who has liked me for the longest time. Granted, he never VERBALLY communicated those feelings to me but even the biggest idiot can tell how he feels based on the way he behaves around me. However, I just never engaged with it because I never saw him in that light.  However, I started spending a lot of time with him lately and our bond and connection has grown even stronger than before. He really is a fantastic guy who I can trust with my deepest darkest secrets and I adore his humor and his positive personality. And then last night and we ended up falling asleep in each other’s arms. It made me feel safe, secure, and protected from the world.  I felt like I could stay in that embrace forever. However, I was not sure if I felt way because there is a chance that I might actually be developing feelings for him or simply because I was vulnerable from my previous heartbreak and was in desperate need of affection. But then this morning, things got so cozy that we ended up kissing each other on instinct. Things then got a bit awkward and he said he would call me either tonight or tomorrow morning so we can talk more about and clear the air between us.

But I don’t know what I should say because like I said.....I don’t know if these feelings stem from vulnerability or genuine attraction. Should I give him a chance or give myself more time to think about how I feel.",romance

"I really like this girl and we seem to get along really well. I love any time I can spend with her and if I'm not with her there's always a part of me thinking of the next time I see her. We only have 1 class together but I feel like she makes it one of my favorite classes. I sometimes feel like she likes me back bc she seems to treat me differently from her other male friends but in a good way. It's a shame tho bc she has a bf, but she also told me she basically thinks he's cheating on her. 

Also one time I was waiting in the lunch line at my school and she came up behind me and we started talking. This one other guy in line started talking to us and he was a bit on the weirder side (seemed like an alright dude tho, anyways) so he told me he could predict my name without me telling him. He eventually got it from some hints I gave him but that doesn't matter. He then said something along the lines of ""lemme ask your girlfriend her name"" and she laughed while I said laughing as well ""oh she's not my girlfriend."" Then we just kinda kept on talking in the line and everything. 

Idk these thoughts are really scattered and ik I'm probably looking too deeply into everything but I just wanted to put this stuff out there.

"There's this guy that I really like, and we first met last year in college as physics lab partners. Long story short, I had a crush on him and invited him to get ice cream with my friends, go to a free concert on campus, and such--and he said no all three times. I took that as a sign that he didn't like me and moved on.

A year later, we are in the same major and in all the same classes. I swore to myself that I would ignore him at all costs so that crush never came back.... and here's what happened:

\- After class, I was walking down the hall, and he yelled my name. This was a pretty long hallway and he's a shy guy, which all struck me as weird. He came up to me and started talking to me about the upcoming football game... which i found odd since we haven't talked in 8 months. And why did he feel the need to tell me about his weekend plans??

\-In another class, we were randomly paired to be in the same group. During class, we formally got to catch up. We talked for 50 minutes, mostly about his study abroad adventure. He told me in great detail about the friends he made and showed me pictures (even pics of when they had movie nights)... he mentioned that he cried when they all parted ways at the end

\-Two weeks later he tells me about an away football game he went to and mentions that the one friend (who was a girl) that he went with had a boyfriend... like why did he add that detail if it had nothing to do with his story???

\-I missed class and texted him to let me know what happened. he replies by emailing me a giant paragraph and an outline about what happened. keep in mind, no one takes notes in this class ,and in the email, he wrote ""sorry you couldn't come to class, I hope you have a good week""

\-Recently, he was standing outside the computer lab and I had swipe access to let the small group of people standing outside the door in. He watches me walk over and swipe everyone in... and he says "" (my name) saves the day"" and continues to have a conversation with me 

\-Remember how I invited him to a concert? Well, he goes to see this artist this year, 3.5 hours away in a different city. I mention that the artist was at our school last year, and though he told me back then that he couldn't go with me since he was hanging out with his friends watching football, his story now is that he ""really , really wanted to go but couldn't""

Reddit, does this boy like me???? Last year, this kid barely seemed interested in holding a conversation with me, and now, he's the one talking to me first. I wanna hang out with him outside of class but don't want to come off as weird..... what do I say/do?",romance
"Okay so close to where I live, there is a store that I grew up going to always. I know all the staff and they all have seen me, I can tell right away when someone  new is added in the team. Recently there's been a new addition, it's a hot ass fucking short girl with light brown hair.  It's tripping me out and I don't want to get my hopes up that someone is actually interested in me before knowing me. Well let me not get ahead of myself yet, so I see her working as usual, without her looking at me.  She has a regular fake smile we can all tell cause she's a cashier like me lol. Well, once she looks at me that chick smiles a lot and she looks happy to see me, it ain't even that she's new lmao, she's been there for like a few months now, thing is it's always the same thing whenever I go. So the thing I also find weird is when my mom went alone, she asked if I was her son. Once my mom told me, it felt like I started and she started maybe (just maybe..(not))  looking forward to seeing each other. I've let my head do its thing and get hyped, however I never have the fucking pair to talk to her. When I'm alone I think about shit to talk about with her, but once I see her, I don't know what to say. Once we make contact bruh my head skdkffk doesn't let me talk. Well I only go to the store in the afternoons cause it's only when she working cause she in school from what a co-worker told me, I might've asked about her instead of actually asking her, cuz imma bitch. So I'll be going to this store once or maybe even twice and it's always the same story. Also she's been trying to make me talk to her (I hope so..not certain) by standing near me and idk I'm so fucking bruh I'm fucking done I missed a fucking opportunity. I just don't know how to approach this girl. Today right after work, I get out at 7pm and she always works afternoon so I know I'm on a tight schedule cause this store closes like at 8:30, I don't even work far from the store but I want to see her so I smoke a bit before going cause I convince myself then to try to talk to her but it ain't neva work. So I get there and as I walk in I check the cashiers (only 2) over the top of the shelves and she spots me out right away as I pop my head up and shes smiling as much as me, I always try to get her as my cashier but the person she was charging was taking their quality time. So I'm leaving without getting a quick look and she finishes with them so tell me why this chick went and was acting like she looking for something in the way of the exit. I knew her actions screamed, ""talk to me you bitch"" but my dumbass just said excuse me, I was going to say her name but I thought it'd be weird since she doesn't know mine. From what I was told also, shorty packing dough and I'm not from a wealthy background but I work for my shit getting through yk avg, so I'd feel fucking weird or fucking retarded going out like in the shitty car I don't even got my own rn but still you know like fuck, I like this chick a lot but I can't say shit cause imma bitch but let's just leave it as that. 🖤 Advice pls",romance
"Okay so um...
I only see him as a platonic friend thing (trying to find out if I'm asexual and stuff rn, cuz I literally feel repelled by the idea of *stuff*)

But um...
We talk a lot, like a LOT, a girl that is also friends with him has told me that he might be interested in me, but umm... I'm a dumbos, is he giving me ""signs"" or am I like, okayish?




**So the things that he does that I think would be considered ""signs"" are:**

- He is always there for me e.g. I feel bad? He's there to give a hug 

- We talk about personal stuff a lot 

- We constantly tease eachother

- ""In case you ever feel down or sad text me okay? Or just text me if you feel like you want to chat or something, yeah""

- Me:* am happy *, him:""Pff"", me:""Whaat?"", him:""That's fucking cute"" (this happens a lot btw)

- So yeah, he calls me cute a lot and often goes ""awww""

- We've hugged so much at a high school trip thing that my shirt literally just smelled like him

- When our class was watching a movie I was trying to find a comfortable position to sleep in, I saw him just kind of shcoot closer to me and move on his chair, until he finally just looked at me and clapped his shoulder, so I slept on his shoulder ;-;

- Recently when I've hugged him, I felt his heart start to beat faster ;-;

- We literally just kinda layed in a dark room and talked for hours on a high school trip which was really chill and nice. I didn't look at him, but I felt his head turn on the pillow to look over at me a few times ;-;

- He leans in a lot when we're talking, a small thing but I can literally feel his like, body temperature thing right next to me ;_;

- Has said a lot of ""*usually* I don't like this, but not with you"" stuff (which sounds so cheesy that I might be lactose intolerant) ;_;

...

Am I an asshole?.. I just... Feel like I can't know for sure if he likes me, unless he tells me. But like... Am asshole for giving ""signs""? Putting my head on his shoulder instead of refusing is probably a ""sign""?..

Am confused 

What is *sign* and what is *friend*?

Am just wanna be friends or something 

Am having a squish but no more than friends 

Am leading him on?

Hjalp


**Update:**

Apparently we're dating now, wow. He has an asexual friend and told me that he recognized a lot of that in me and that's why he held off on making a ""move"". He is also confused himself btw, so we don't know where this is going yet, all we know is that we have *something* and that *something* feels nice",romance

"So in 6th grade I had a crush on a girl and we hung out and talked a lot. This continued throughout the year and during that summer we would text each other a lot. We both really liked each other and everyone thought we were dating but we never did. Her constantly texting me got kinda annoying so I decided to just ignore it being the stupid idiot that I am. 7th grade starts and I still kinda ignore her but we still liked each other. Since I didn’t have any classes with her we drifted further and further apart throughout the year. I still liked her but was not sure if she liked me because whenever she would see me in the hall she looked away. Again, I acted idiotically and said I didn’t like her to some of my friends that then said it to her friends (who most likely told her). The following year (8th grade now) I have some classes with her and take opportunities to talk to her. She talks back and we have a good time. Just when I think I have a chance, she gets a boyfriend and now I’m left liking her and not knowing what to do. I sent a text to her saying that I’m sorry and that I still like her for the sake of getting it off my chest. She responds that she fine and respects me for telling the truth and respecting her life. My question is... do I have a chance with her in the future during high school or even now? And if so, what should I do?",romance
"Not sure how to go about this really. Long story short: I met a girl online, we chatted for about a week or two before I asked if she wanted to get drinks, we met up at a bar near her place, had that “aren’t first dates awkward” conversation, then we ended going back to her place to watch a movie, we smoked, we cuddled, one thing led to another and we ended up staying the night. We parted ways the next morning but stayed in touch throughout the following week. We decided to meet up to see a movie and cuddled a bit in the theater, but she didn’t invite me back to her place and we weren’t able to talk too much because of the movie. We’ve been talking over text every day since, but it looks like we won’t be able to see each other until after next weekend. 

I’m not really sure what kind of advice I’m looking for here. We’ve talked about what we’re both looking for and it seems like both of us are just trying to go with the flow and see where this leads. I’ve only known her a little while but I think she’s really cool and interesting and would definitely be interested in pursuing whatever this is, but I’m afraid of coming off as clingy or crowding her. As it is, I’m trying to stop finding an excuse to text her everyday just so she can have a day or two break from me. Sidebar: can you tell I have low confidence? And poor social skills? And have never been in a real relationship before?

Basically: what are the next steps I should be taking to make sure I don’t screw things up and how can I keep her interested without coming off as needy?",romance
"Just met a girl online and been talking just a few days. I'm 26m. Shes 22f. I asked what the most romantic thing is she thought someone could do for her. Just cause we've already talked about family, hobbies, work, relationship goals, and small talk goes nowhere. But shes just not responding. She already did this with another situation that was just miscommunication without trying to talk about it. Opinions? 

P.s. I really want to make something work here. She seems my type, and I havent been in a relationship for a while so I've told myself I'm going to do whatever it takes to put my all into someone again. Thanks in advance",romance

"     Liked this guy since I was 10. In 6th grade a mutual friend of ours also liked him... She go over it. 
   
7th grade my aunt died, also was sexually harassed and lost my memory of it. But, regained it that year. I tried killing myself multiple times. But he was always there to help me. Every single day that year I remembered how I told myself, “he’s so cute.” That yeah that’s when I knew I really liked him. I would try to sit by him during reading time in the library. 
Also we used to call each other a lot. 
     
8th grade, was aight. I really was hard on myself. I would compare myself to all the girl’s he would talk to. So, I just stopped talking to him in during class n stuff. I told him how I felt.... he never saw it. Also I had a thing with this guy that year from North Carolina. 
     
9th grade told myself, “BITCH GET OVER HIM!!” I tried to... didn’t work. I still loved him, plus I tried to make it seem like nothing happened...

"[TLDR At the bottom]

So about 4 months ago I met a girl at my work (I’m a waiter 24m) and we hit it off really well and she kinda claimed me as her best friend. Now I had not been in a relationship in a very long time and everyone that had seen us together told me that she was totally into me. So of course I get excited and we hang out a few times and I ask her out, no biggie right? BIGGIE. She told me she didn’t really feel that way for me and that we should try to be friends. 

   So of course I was like yeah sure absolutely, but classic me I had already fallen for her super hard. But I was still happy to have her as a friend. 

   Fast forward 2 months and we are still pretty cool with each other we are hanging out a little less but now she is really seeming to be into me. Idk if she just is super flirty or what but I was convinced that she had a thing for me. So I kinda eased into asking if she liked me again. Bad idea. Now she’s sure. I spend about a week or two being heartbroken and still having to see her every day at work. 

   After those few weeks she stopped talking to me outside of work, stopped texting me, you know, the works. 

  Fast forward to now. She unfriended me on Snapchat, and I have texted her earlier this morning asking her if she wants to talk it out rather than just blocking each other on social media and having to work together every day in misery. She had not responded or viewed my text.

Idk what to do. I’m pretty sure I still have feelings for her and I’ve never been heartbroken before and idk how to deal with these feelings. 
I really like her as a person and she and I were pretty good friends. 

   I guess what I’m asking for is some advice on how to deal with these feelings and if you think it would be feasible to repair out friendship?

Everyone thought we were dating or should be dating, but we never did. Now theres this other guy right? we'll call him dillan. We were good friends in 6th grade for a month or so but then he started being rude to me. So like all of middle school me and dillan hated each other. We would always fight. However for christmas we had class secret santa, and by amazing chance, i got my crush at the time, elliot, and dillan got me. I thought  nothing of it at the time, but looking back it was ironic. I still had a mega crush on elliot, and he was kinda giving me signs he felt the same. So 8th grade summer comes along. Me and elliot got into a HUGE argument and our friendship kinda ended. Both of my good girl friends, mel and abby dated dillan, abby for like 4 months, mel for like a week. However mel kissed him, abby never did. They were fighting about stuff and abby and mel stopped being friends because of all of the drama involved. At the time honestly i could give a dingos kidney about dillan and  the whole situation. Then freshmen  year started. I guess me and him were just tired of fighting. So we stopped arguing. This was in august this year. In the middle of october, we were both stuck after school (me and dillan, that happens a lot cause both of our moms work at school) and we played a game of never have i ever and truth or dare and stuff with some of the 8th graders. Nothing happened between us, but we both found out more about each other. That night i texted him and said, ""hey that was fun we should do that again sometime."" And he texted me back agreeing. Then we got into a really deep conversation. The next day i didnt really think much of it, but you know, It was interesting cause we hadn't been friends for years. Two days later was my friend emmas birthday party. Dillan is emmas best friend, other than me, so only us two were invited. At the parry, dillan kept pushing down my hat and stuff, saying ""curse of blinding"". Then on the car ride home, i sat in the middle of the two of them, and emma, who has no personal space tried to sleep on my shoulder. I then half leaned on hin shoulder kinda awkwardly cause i didnt know if he'd take it weird, cause its not like i had a crush on him. but for some reason i really wanted to grab his hand. He took of my hat to make me more comfortable on his shoulder, and then I went from just kinda resting on the end of his shoulder to actualy resting in the crevice of his neck. His hand was on my knee and he rested his chin on my head, and it was weird and different but i just enjoyed it and relaxed and so did he. Then later that night right after i got home he texted me and long story short he told me he was starting to like me. We decided to just be friends andd figure this out. He agreed that it was all really impulsive and stuff. Then on halloween me and emma went over to his house. We were just fooling around and i sat down in this little closet thing under a blanket. He came into the closet and emma Shut the door and we started fooling around locking her out. Then she dissapeared and we just sat awkwardly in the closet staring at each other. Then his MOM came in the room and emma was like,""theyre in the closet"". So yeah. Ans then recently its weird cause like he'll stand close to me an let me hug him and play with his hair and stuff and if i wear a hat he'll do the curse of blinding thing i told you about , and were going to banquet (private school equivalent of a dance ) together as friends, but i dont know if he still has feelings for me. The  thing now is that i have feelings for  him. And oh i forgot. EMMA likes him too. And this girl a grade up. And the girl a grade up is tryna compete with me for him. So like i like him now but i dont know if he feels the same. So. WHAT SHOULD I DO REDDIT.",romance

"Hello, all of you, I hope that you are doing well. This is on mobile and may be a bit heavy, so please bear with me.

Well, to begin with, I am confused with my sexuality. I think I am not straight, but I am not sure, and the confusion is very unsettling to be. I literally only stop it from troubling me by not thinking about it, which I am aware is a healthy way to approach it. At times, I feel like I am gay, and at other times I feel like I am bi, and sometimes I feel like I am a weird straight teenager who has an unhealthy habit of being attracted to **ahem** 'fun time videos' involving only guys. So, in short, I am quite confused.

The main reason that I am posting is to ask about a recent experience that I had a few days ago. I was standing behind my team member in the lab and I had a sudden urge to kiss him. Like, a full-on liplock. I had to make myself walk away from him and tell myself to focus back on our lab work.

The problem is, I am a very typical studious person. I have never been in a romantic/sexual relationship, and I just like to adore romance from a distance by looking at romance Webtoons and the like. In addition, I hate lip-to-lip kisses, and I think they are gross, which is why I am very confused as to why I experienced a strong urge to kiss.

Now, coming to my questions:

1. What am I to make of this feeling? Is it just hormones or something more?
2. What effect does this have on what I perceive to be my sexuality?
3. Should I turn out to be not straight and something else, how do I accept myself for who I am and not leave this in the closet?

Thank you all for reading that long info dump. Feel free to ask any further questions to get a clarity about me. I hope you all have a nice day!",romance
"We have seen many similar stories appearing in social media, the news, in our own social groups. When the stories come to light it always seems easy to say ""why bring it up now and not then?""

This story is about sexual assault.

My girlfriend lived with me for part of the summer three years ago. I lived with three other flatmates. Two boys (boy a and boy b) who I went to school and college with who I have known for the almost 12 years, and another guy (boy c) who I had met through boy A.

Three summers ago, we were all partying and having fun. One of my housemates was particularly in the partying mood. One day whilst I was at work boy A got into my bed whilst my girlfriend was sleeping, she awoke to him in our bed and they spoke about his night out. She told him she was gonna go back to sleep. She then awoke to him cuddling her and his hand up her pajama top and around her bare breast. She froze and panicked. She managed to get herself out of the situation before it got worse.

After that he went to his room and they never spoke about it.

She told me when I got home from work. I didn't say anything to him. I was scared I didn't know what to do.

Boy A did not only do what was said above but he and boy C accused her of trying to sleep with boy C. She confronted them and they admitted that they had speculated it and twisted her words (she made a bad joke.) Boy C admitted that he thought my girlfriend fancied him, ( we had been together for 4 years at this point.)

My girlfriend suffers from PTSD, about a month ago after a night out and an encounter with a creepy stranger ( I was in a queue for a gig t-shirt) she had a flashback of the night. We started to argue and she said "" it's your fault you left me with a stranger at a gig!, Just like you left me with your friend(boy A).""

Since that night we have been arguing over what to do. She feels that because of the way he has treated her; secually assaulting her, accusing her trying to sleep with our housemate, constantly leaving her out of plans that involve all our friends, when she had no where live over the summer he refused to let her live with us, she feels likes he's now trying to push her out, she's done with him. She's blocked him on every platform. She wants me to do the same. That he abused my trust as well and our friendship. I said that if I asked him about it and he accepted it and apologised I could forgive him.

My girlfriend asked if she were to kiss another man would I forgive her I said no I wouldn't, that is different. Although in all honesty she had a male friend who kissed her and when she told me I told her she couldn't see him anymore. To this day she hasn't.

In any case I spoke to my friend recently and asked him he said "" well I don't remember doing it but if I did I'm sorry I don't remember much from that night as I was f***ed on drugs and alcohol, but I am sorry""

To me he sounded sorry and I forgive him. But I told him I needed my girlfriend to make amends before we can get back to normal.

I think forgiving him completely will have a massive impact on our relationship.

I don't think my girlfriend will ever make amends with him. But what does that mean for me and boy A?

I just don't know what to do.

Should I abandon years of friendship? Should I let go of the 7 year relationship?

Am I wrong for wanting that friendship?

If I lose friendship with boy A I could lose friendship with boy B and alot of other mutual friends.

But I love my girlfriend.

I know I should have done this years ago but I didn't. What do I do?",romance

"10/17/19

You’re the one I love the most. No matter how far apart we are, you’re the first thing that comes into my mind when I wake up or when I go to sleep. We may be far apart due to distance but no matter what, my heart and soul is always with you. I miss you wholeheartedly, all I really want right now is fro you to send me a simple message. I want you to tell me how much you miss me. Wherever you are right now, I hope you’re thinking of me too. No matter what happens I will always be thinking about you.

I love to daydream, but whenever I daydream you’re the one thing that appears in all of them. I love to dream that one day this distance is no longer in our way, I dream of all the greatest possibilities we can do as a couple, we’d hold hands, kiss, and cuddle. And when night comes we’d make love, letting our desires wash over us. We’ll have jobs; I will be working as a social worker and you work as a doctor, together we’d be living in a nice and big apartment and in our apartment we’d cook, clean, and play video games on our PlayStation all day.

And in 8 years we’d marry and throw a ceremony we’ll say our vows as our friends and family smiles and cry’s it’s joy. On our honeymoon we’ll be staying in a tropical island and every night we’ll be making love and cuddle after that. Soon enough we’ll be having children and we’ll love them regardless. Together we’d raise our children and teach them life lessons, we’d watch them grow up and together we’ll grow old together in a small cabin and reunite in the afterlife. And if we ever get the chance to live again I’d fall for you all over again",romance
"I give flowers and write cards. I shower with gifts and bring his fav meals, snacks, and drinks. I try to surprise him outside his workplace. I find new stuff to liven things up in bed. I bust my brains thinking of different places to take him out to. I do my best to bring his fantasies and whims to life. He finds it moderately pleasant, but I feel as though I try so hard only to have it fall flat in the end. There's no reciprocation. I'm always thinking of what might put a happy twist in his life, but I don't get that vibe from him. He used to make me happy without trying, but as we grow distant, I'd have liked to see him try to connect to me in a way that shows he wants add to my life. I'm not a gold digger in the slightest, but I do value diversity in expression of love. I'm not good at little everyday gestures, so I have to make up for that with effort-invested actions. And maybe I need someone who is as cringingly romance-minded as I am. His love for me was the kind that stayed steady and didn't need gimmicks for it to thrive.

"Ok so today my Teachers from Choir arranged a pizza celebration for us students. I have this guy friend which I only talk to in Choir. When I was waiting for the pizza, we had this conversation:        
Him: Do you have a Boyfriend?                                       
Me: Nope.                                                                                
Him: Do you have a crush?                                                
Me: No, but I did a few months ago.                              
Him: Who? Who?                                                                 
Me: I’m not telling you. By the way why are you asking if I have a bf even though I don’t?
Him: Just asking since you asked about my exam marks yesterday.                                                   
Then he asked a few more other Choir members about relationships until this happened:                  
Choir kid: Do you have a girlfriend? ( he’s asking my guy friend )

Choir kid: Oh, ( My Name )                                               
Me: Eww                                                                                 
Then after that he also said eww. After getting my pizza slice we never talked after that. He didn’t seem mad but it’s weird cause he’s usually talkative or maybe I’m just paranoid. Did I do anything wrong?

"I know no one is going to read this, but this is mostly just for myself for when I want to cry and get sappy.

To start, id just like to say I am so incredibly lucky to not only have such an open-minded, supportive, sweet, and caring boyfriend ever, but to have gotten with him so soon without feelings of rejection and fear.

I have known my partner for a few years now, either 2 or 3. When I first met him, it was because of my abusive ex. He and my partner, who I will call C from now on, were very close friends and always hung out. I was going off and on with my ex (I'll call him M) for weeks, it was just a sex thing for me and I will admit I hurt him a lot because of this. However, his reaction was a huge red flag for who he is. He took personal texts that I sent him and made it look like I was obsessed with him and that he was a cold badass, meanwhile, it was usually the other way. I would tell him I didn't want anything serious, and he would beg for a relationship and treat me like shit. He made himself look amazing in these youtube videos he showed his friends and made me look insane. Anyway, in these videos, he called me Purple Skittlez because at the time he first met me I had purple hair.C heard about this from M and started to call me purple skittlez obnoxiously.

 I will admit, he was very annoying in the first two years I knew him. After that, I sorta lost contact as I was isolated by M from everyone. In August, specifically, August 29, I met C personally for the first time. I remember it so clearly. I walked in and saw him sitting there next to my old friend since 4th grade. I sat down next to him and said hi. It felt like an immediate connection between us like we were already together. It was a spark of electricity. I've never laughed so hard in my life that day. 

After that, we went out to lunch and we arranged to meet up with a large group of friends at a football game the next day.So Friday, august 30th roles around and I am freaking out nervous. I knew I was crushin' hard and I wanted something to happen that night. I put on my best makeup and felt like such a cutie when I rolled up to the football game. He and I met with our friend, who I'll call R at Dunkin and waited for another friend to meet up with us. I was sweating bullets while sitting across from him, and I just stared at him in awe. So the football game starts and we go to get the ticket to get in and they say ""Oh a couple, have fun"" and I'm sure I turned bright red cause he laughed when he looked at my face. 

For pretext, that friend that we were waiting for knew I was interested in C and told him ""Yeah, \[my name\] is going to flirt with you cause she wants to fuck you"" which wasn't true at the time, I just wanted to be with him. So, he already knew and was flirting back, he's even told me if she hadn't told him that he wouldn't have come off as strongly as he did.So basically, we go into a dugout with our friends and us just hangout playing music, he went to go do pullups on a bar so he gave me his hat (that I still have to this day). We eventually go into the grass and he took off his hoodie, so I took it and put it on. (TMI but lemme just say when I smelled his scent I got so fucking high it was like I snorted coke.) We were flirting pretty fucking hard, but the girl who told him also was interested in him and was trying to compete with me. 

For example, he asked who wanted to be cuddle buddies and I said yes... but so did she. So we joked and said it was a threesome cuddle. We were just very close immediately.Now, R was single at the time and dealing with a breakup. He was pretty jealous of C and me, so he, C, the other girl (A) and I all walked over to R's house with his younger sister so he could get some stuff and cry. While we waited outside C just randomly comes out with ""who doesn't want to be single this year?"" C, A, and I all raised our hands. He jokingly said ""hmm this is hard"" and A immediately put her hand down, he told me he only said that cause he knew she'd back out, and that he would've chosen me no matter what. He asked if I was serious and I nervously said yes.

 We held hands walking back to the game and we cuddled on the bleachers for the rest. He was so sweet and cute that night I'm smiling so hard remembering it.there's so much more that's happened since then, and I'm so incredibly grateful that I got together with him so quickly, unlike some people who wait years to get with their partner, if it even happens at all. We have both said if we didn't get together that night it would've happened the following week, as we both had a strong attraction to each other from the get-go.

I am as well very cautious at love as well, but I have never dated anyone in my life and I’m bad with boys. The boy I actually am interested in knows I’ve never been on a first date etc.I’ve been talking to this guy for the past week, and he made it seem like he was interested in me in terms.We have been talking from 4:55pm-9:09pm one time  at night.  When we first talked on a dating app, we also hit it off pretty well and talked for an hour and than talked again from 12-2 am. I felt a connection, and I’m not even sure if he does as well deep down. I can see it already that he might feel a connection, but doesn’t know it.. He has stated he finds me interesting, but Personally, I thought he was giving me signs that he wanted to hangout etc. He has given me plenty of compliments about my hair, founded me very adorable/ cute in my picture, teasing me and joking with me a lot. We even had a few disagreements/ agreements and I thought he gave me hints and I told him personally. Yet, he told me “ I haven’t been given any hints. I’m a very cautious person, and I know your looking for a serious relationship, but I’m not sure what I’m looking for.” So, I’m a bit hesitant a bit,but he brought up that if I ever feel alone and want to ever talk I can talk to him.  He seems very interested in me and I do know I have to take it slow/ get to know him which can take months and I’m fine with that. So any advice, because I felt like we were acting like long time friends/ joking/teasing a lot.

Kevin: I see his heart, it means SOOO fucking well, CARES, even when he's a bit of a dick. He's just, such a fucking CUTE softy at his core... Jessica: I find myself ENAMORED with her emotions, and her expression thereof... The way she puts her HEART in her singing, her ADORABLE, GENUINE expression of deep care and concern for people and things where she's cutely like ""awwwww"" about it or something to that effect... *chuckles* Then oddly enough, there's MYSELF(autoromanticism -and autosexuality- for the WIN): I've been through SO fucking much, BECOME so fucking much, some of which is so strong, and PIERCINGLY beautiful, I'm in tears typing about it at THIS moment! FUUUUUCK!!! How about we two couples become a QUARTET... I'm such a fucking CUTE, LUSTFUL, PASSIONATE, little thing! We all are... We... could REALLY use this... We owe it to ourselves and one another to BASK in each other's PASSION... These thoughts and emotions make me feel more ALIVE than I've felt in YEARS(""Awake and Dreaming"" by Laura Brehm plays POWERFULLY in my heart and head while I contemplate what we could BE to one another)... Damn, last night I dreamed the 4 of us were having a conversation. *siiiiiiiigh* Kevin and Jessica were so TANTALIZINGLY nearby, and I KNEW it was a dream, so I got closer to them -while bringing BOTH of their faces closer to mine- and started PASSIONATELY kissing both of them. MY GOD, it felt amazing... I WANT them, perhaps NEED them??? Such are the perks of having dominion over most others in my dreams, I think it's because they're mere mental MODELS of real-life people that house part of my OWN consciousness... &lt;3

P.S. Half-disregard this WHOLE thing: although it's based on real emotions, but they're half-exaggerated(save for the emotions about ME). *chuckles* I guess I just DIDN'T want to lose them, you know? I don't feel like losing yet MORE people, and I truly LOVE them... THIS was my last, desperate mindfuckery to feel connected to ANYONE. I no longer feel connected to A SOUL(I ended up remembering I feel quite connected to ""The Main Soul"" at times, so pehaps I'm ok?), nor do I feel like I ever can again. My heart just keeps fucking BREAKING, my suicide feels eminent. Thank you, God(ultimately decided NOT to die, keeping these notes on my phone for reflection)...",romance
So i have been talking to my friend and to keep his identity safe i will call this friend hank. frank was telling me the other day about this app called mico chat and said that this one chick messaged him. Now it seems abit weird that this chick messaged him first and asked him to meet up for a date. Then she asked him to sign up for pairbooking (which ive never heard) and then was asked to put his card info on aswell as his name to help verify him (i knew it was a red flag as soon  as he mentioned card.she told him he would be charged certain amount and that the amount would be refunded two days later. Is this legit or is my friend falling for some sort of scam?,romance
"We have been together for nearly 3 years, i've had a crush on him since 5th grade (yes when i was 10), we started dating beginning of 2017 when we were in 11th grade and we both just finished out first year of uni. He was a complete sweetheart however he use to be very inconsiderate (When it gets cold midday and im wearing a tshirt and his wearing a hoodie and jacket he doesnt offer them) and many sequences which I have let go.

However i was speaking to my friend and she said i should let go of him after these incidents have occurred:

\- He told me to shut the fuck up when i was crying hysterically in his car and was driving me home intending to just drop me there and leave until i asked him why he was in a bad mood.

\- He dumped me for 2 months (March - April) to 'find himself' and insisted he was out of love with me.

\- He has kicked me out of his car after I got mad that we couldn't eat after watching a movie (we were right infront of the restaurant). Basically whenever we plan a nice date full day, he always cancels half-day because his family said 'this' 'that' and to chill with them instead.

\- On my birthday, instead of spending the day with me he went to a sleepover with his friends.

PS: And no he isn't cheating as he always snaps his whereabouts and we both have our locations turned on, on snapchat!

"On the outside I am the picture perfect woman. I’m 33, young but successful, witty, pretty, kind, down to earth, generous with my money and my time. I’m a good daughter, a good sister, an excellent wife. Im intellectual. Assertive, open minded, somewhat aggressive, but never an asshole. Mostly. And most of the time I’m good with this, and I feel Content and lucky for all that I have. A husband who treats me like a queen, a solid, faithful marriage, healthy in trust, love and in sex. But then there’s the other part of me, the one I suppress, the dark side of me. She lives somewhere deep inside my chest cavity, like that janky kitchen drawer full of random keys and take out menus, only mine is a veritable Pandora’s box.  In this Pandora’s box she bangs against the walls, hoping to get free. My dark passenger. Most of time I’m able to forget she exists, and have that kitchen drawer locked up tight. But sometimes she slips through each nook the cranny, pushing me to let her out. 

It’s a life long struggle. Is it because I’ve been with my husband since we were teens? And haven’t had many sexual partners? but I’m sexually adventurous, much more so than my husband. I like to play. And he does too. But his limits are nowhere near my limits. It’s not enough. He abides the toys we play with, he loves it when he bottoms out from anal, he loves it when I squirt all over him. But those are regular games, normal games. I want to play the big boy games.

I want to fuck, and be fucked. I want to be tied up, blindfolded, tossed up like a thanksgiving turkey, ripe
For the taking. I want to dance like we fuck, sometimes fast, sometimes slow. I want to let go and not think. I want to be told what to do, whether it’s to make myself come while you watch, or make you come with just my tongue. I want to play games, meet in a bar and pretend we don’t know each other, nor the way you taste. Kiss a stranger while you watch, brooding. I want to have a quickie in the bathroom, maybe with more than one partner. I’m a greedy lover after all. I want to feel everything at once.  I want my ass to be red from your slaps while we fuck, my hands tied behind my back, while other people watch. I want so much more than what we’re doing. But most of all, I want to destroy you. I want to push you to the edge and watch you fall apart.  I want you to break, while I feast on your blood. (Metaphorically, not literally 😉)I want to do that and so much more...

But he won’t hear any of it. So my dark desires stay locked up tight. In Pandora’s box. Never to see the light of day.

Is it normal? Is this what’s is like after 15 years together, suppressing all of these desires? He won’t ever budge, or try anything else. No bdsm, no role play, no spontaneous games. So it’s a moot point. The sex is fantastic, I’m not complaining about that, but I’m not Sure it’s because I’m uninhibited and my body is able to come every few minutes, or because of him. We don’t have children yet but will soon. 

Any others like me? If so, would really love to hear how you deal.",romance

I can be me with friends, with strangers, but I cannot be me with the one who matters most? I want a love where I can be me. Where I can be free. Where she feels the same. Where she can be her. Without deception, without games, without bullshit. Is it too much to ask? The wind whispers ""yes"" and I despair.",romance

"Okay.. so like the title says my dream girl has a problem yet to be diagnosed - it has been a few weeks now.  She is sweet, smart and beautiful.  She is always on point.. hair, clothes.. and it always seems like she isn't even trying, unbelievable really.  She has had a constant headache for the past months and has gone through tons of testing but the problem has yet to be resolved or even diagnosed.. The thing about this girl is that even though she is in pain she is always smiling and can easily laugh at my jokes and act sweetly when I tease her. Realize I am not dating her, if I were I would know exactly what to do.. flowers, head massages, notes, etc.  I really want to ask her if she would like a quick head massage (since I give good ones for headaches) but it just doesn't seem right and so I haven't.  I will admit that I have had the problem in the past where I did not make a move soon enough - the girl/woman has said I've been waiting for you to do that all night -..  and this makes me wonder if there were times I should have made a move and did not.  But honestly I go at my own pace and what feels right and I think that should be okay.  I broke up with my fiancee about 2 and a half years ago and this girl.. well she is.. When I first met her a little more than a year ago she was out of my league (a big reason I left my fiancee is because I had fell into ruin and became a completely different person during my time with her) and now I think she is still out of my league but I have made vast improvements to myself and the difference between us is much less.  A few months ago I was tongue tied even just talking to her.. this has only happened to me once before.. I could write like this for a while longer so.. what should I DO??!  A note slipped into her bag sounds nice but is that weird?  No girl makes me feel this way and I have dated  A LOT - though not since before my fiancee.  Any ideas would be much appreciated!  Feel free to diagnose the situation I laid before you as well!  For reference I see her 3-4 times a week.  We have gone on short walks together back from class as our homes are fairly near each other.  She constantly smiles around me but I am not sure if she feels anything for me and I am not sure if she knows how I feel.  We text quite a bit sometimes and I have asked her to dinner and to the movies but both times she had plans with her Mom who lives close by so I don't think I those were excuses to let me down gently.  I know I probably shouldn't put too much stock in one person but there has been no one else I feel good about besides a woman I met in Colombia but there are some drawbacks there as she is successful and has 2 kids.. so I would have to be an insta father (which I am not keen on) and she would have to move here or I there.. so no go.

"Obligatory I'm on mobile disclaimer

So I met this girl in a workshop event about career planning. We sat next to each other because it was our assigned seat. In a free time, we talked quite a bit about each of our career plans and a bit about our past. It was a good talk.

So a week after the event, just now in fact, I messaged her and it went like this:

(This is a translated convo)

Me: ""Hey, you like cats and ice cream?""

Her: ""Hmm, yeah. What is this about?""

Me: ""I kinda want to go to this cat cafe. Maybe you want to join [me]?""

*Silence for 20 minutes*

Her: ""Ohh. Hmm. I want to.. But too bad.. My parents don't allow me to interact with cats..""

Me: ""Ahh haha okay then.""

Her: ""umm, I'm so sorry. Maybe you can ask your other friend to go with you.. :)""

Me: ""Haha it's alright, relax 😁""

Her: ""Okay then..""

So, it's not a hard no.

At first I want to check this cat cafe out on my own but then I thought I could invite her and kill two birds with one stone, get to talk to her more and be close friends or whatever. I'm kinda interested in this girl as she's real fun to talk to, just to clarify.

Also, this is the first time I asked a girl out in a long time and I've never been in a relationship in my whole life.

Should I keep trying to get close to her and invite her to other places later or should I just let it go? I don't want to come off as annoying or creepy.

I'm 22 yo and, in my country, it's common for people my age to still live with their parents.

(Inb4 lmao virgin)


Edit: her reason might seem silly but it's plausible that she's telling the truth. Overprotective parents are quite common here and people are mostly very respectful of the elders. But then again, should I take that as a hint that she's not interested?",romance
"for as long as i can remember life has been black and white. up until a week ago I was wishing death on myself. but now theres you and the idea of living no longer seems so bad, its terrifying. i found comfort in the isolation of my depression, waking up to smoke, hunt down xanax on the internet, then proceed to lay down in my bed binge watching some shitty reality tv show or blasting music. my thoughts are way to fucking loud and i wasnt tryna hear them. my feelings were even louder i just wanted to be numb. hiding from the world i decided to succumb to my depression after i tried to get out of an abusive relationship with my ex...he put a knife to my throat. i endured a year of 11 years of abuse in my home before i returned back to foster care only to go through another year of abuse with my ex. and it killed me to walk away because he was the closest thing to luv ive ever known. but now hes gone and im here life weighs heavy on my shoulders. i remember thinking maybe i need some sunlight to get out of the funk. i got to the end of my street and was like oh fuk this was a terrible idea now i have to go all the way back. i collapsed like 3 times. i began a ritual of  drinking as soon as the sun went down dancing in my room until i couldnt anymore. then pass out before the world caught up to me again. ive been alone for so long and now theres you. we were like 15 when we first met. it was a short encouter no more than 20 minutes i was with my friends and you were with yours and that was it you later got a girlfriend i remember seeing you and her on snapchat. that was 4 years ago. but you are here now and i dont know how to process. depression is the only constant i have in my life. its predictable, never changing, i wake up and its there sitting on my chest, throughout the day it occupies the corners of my mind. i feel it slicking the tunnels of my veins like oil...sometimes i get the urge to cut myself and let it out...this sickness in me. sometimes it works. the day before i bumped into you i was sitting on my living room couch high as fuck staring up at the ceiling fan wondering if it could be support my weight if i decided to 'kick the chair'. now im staring up at the sky from out your car window and im sober as fuck. i can feel everything. sometimes i like it. most of the time i dont. something in my head is telling me to run for the hills but that self destructive part of me insists i stick around for a little.",romance
"Background: I’m in high school and I’ve known this guy for a couple years

So I’ve been friends with a guy for sometime, as I’ve liked him for almost a year. Recently, I told a couple of my close friends, which included some of his friends, that I liked him. His friends started ghosting him because I said I might want to ask him out. That afternoon, he called me, we talked, and we ended the call by me saying if I wanted to I would tell him what I wanted to ask him that day. I later texted him  and told him I was going to ask him out. So he replied back saying that he didn’t really want a relationship right now, but that he used to like me. However, I never really got a chance to ask him out, therefore I’m stuck wondering if I should ask him, or if I should wait or forever hold my silence. I feel like I should mention that earlier, I have ‘acted weirdly’ and that caused him to ghost me for a month, hence why I am so hesitant. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",romance

"Hey you guys! Hope you all have been well. 

It’s been a while since I’ve posted something, sorry about that. Sadly, this update is anything but happy. Let’s dive right in. 

A few weeks ago, I had a conversation with one of my friends, we’ll call her Neptune, about Mars. She had been telling me about her boy problems and how she didn’t know which boy she liked more between two guys she had been seeing. I felt like I should share my predicament with my crush with her since she spilled so much info out to me. Mind you, Neptune and I are not that close. We’re close by association but we don’t really hang out usually. Anyway, I told her about him, showed her a picture and she was like, “Oh, yeah I think I’ve seen him around! He’s cute, you should go for it!” I didn’t really think much this conversation at the time and forgot about it quite frankly.  

Fast forward to last week and I see one of my close friends, let’s call him Orion (I’m running out of planets), and he tells me that he’s been seeing Neptune and Mars hang out a lot as of late. At first I was shocked. I couldn’t believe she would make a move knowing that I liked him. After thinking it over for a few hours, I though, “maybe it’s not like that for him.” He often hangs out with girls one on one and it doesn’t mean anything, so I shrugged it off. But the actions speak multitudes. 

I decided to go out this weekend and watch him play a game. She wasn’t there and I was a little bit excited. Afterwards we went and got a bite to eat with a group of friends and everything was going well, he was engaging with me, different than before, but it was still something so I was thankful. I asked him and some of my other guy friends if they wanted to hang out later and he didn’t really say anything so I figured he needed a nap. I took a nap too and then went with the same group of people to go watch a movie. I tried to ask him to come with us because I decided that no matter which way it went for me, I was going to tell him that I liked him. RIP me. 🤦🏻‍♀️ 

He was nowhere to be found so we all just hung out and then crashed for the day. The next day was our school’s fall festival and I was curious to go because I wanted to see if it was all it was hyped up to be. Mind you, it crossed my mind that they might show up together, but I was hoping that didn’t happen. God must’ve know I would’ve been crushed if I saw them. My friend asked me for help with something and I got distracted and missed the fall festival. Turns out, Mars and Neptune were there and apparently they were the talk of the night. Sigh. 

I know it’s my own fault because I didn’t make a move, but at the same time, I don’t even know if that would’ve made a difference. I will always hold out hope for the possibility of Mars and I dating. I’ve liked him for so long, he has qualities that I see as husband material. He checks off almost every box on a list I didn’t even know I had. I know he doesn’t feel the same, so for now I’m taking a step back. I don’t think I can even get tutoring from him anymore, it’ll just remind me of the magnitude of the person that I let slip through my fingers. If nothing ever comes from our friendship, he will always be the one who got away. 😔 

I realize that he is not the end of the world and that my story is most certainly not finished. Nonetheless, I am pausing this part of my life to grieve the loss of what could have been. It hurts a lot, but it won’t break me. I am strong and resilient and I will get over it. I decided I’m not going to hang out with him or any of our mutual friends for the remainder of the time before Christmas break. I just can’t handle another sad thing happening in my life. BUT DO NOT FEAR! I’ll be back next year (or before depending on what happens) with more TEA to be spilled ☕️.

Thanks for being my listeners and friends, 

I appreciate all of you. And I’ll return, I promise. 

Your grateful and a little doubtful friend, the ever changing,

"I just want to talk about one specific time, it is a little rough in spots, so fair warning. I'm not going into the gritty details but it could upset someone. Outside of me and my fiancé no one knows this full story.

Long backstory short I had an unwanted pregnancy from an unsavory interaction at a party. I didnt tell anyone from shock because I didnt have a clue until 3 months in and shame.

The pregnancy made me hormonal and with a weak support system and a number of other emotions I became very depressed. One day to the point of writing a goodbye note to everyone I know.

I saved my boyfriend (now fiancé) for last. I had been avoiding him to hide everything from him, but he still stuck with me.

So I'm keeping serious relationships to if/when I'd actually move out, but in the meantime I'm wondering what I'm missing, and how much of my personality remains untouched due to my lack of a social life.

But we have similar interests and we spent a lot of time together for a little bit, so we know each other well.

He once came up to me in the study hall between classes (no one else was around) and said he missed spending time with me, and he was being very weirdly attentive because he’s generally very easy to distract? Also, one time I was working on a project in one of our mutual classes (an art elective) and he suddenly hugged me and whirled me around (he’s much taller).

"There's this girl I met lats June and we got really close real quick. We had so much similarities that is just too fucking crazy to even be so similar. Anyways, we always talk until late at night almost every day and night or from time to time and we had a few video calls. She even clings to me when going to movies and is just being playful with me. We just sometimes have ""dates"" even though none of us had confessed. There's no label in our relationship either. Idk if we're just friends or more. But there were times where I was drunk and she'd ask me some questions about being in a relationship. She heavily implies (and me as well) that there's something more yet we dont have the guts to spill it out. Then on the night of my birthday i get drunk and she let me sleep on her shoulder/chest, stroked my hair and cuddled. But despite those lovey dovey shit we did I sometimes questioned if it was all real since she sometimes brings up her crushes as if she's intentionally doing it and talks about her  makeout buddy sometimes (it sucks but i still really like her anyway). I got my hopes up but now it's all crumbling since she barely talks to me now and she's ignoring my messages. It wasn't like before now. And I really hate. It feels as if we're drifting apart. Her best friends know me now. We're close friends but is there really something more? Or is she just leading me on? There were some red flags and my friends even warned me about her being known as a problematic person in her school yet she seems to be a great person, to me at least. I'm trying to understand her but it seems I'm the only one here who's just initiating the first move. I still want her but idk anymore. It's been a week but she still hasn't replied. I know she's a very busy person since she's a top student and all but if she truly cares, she'd message me, right? She told me that she cares. But i don't know anymore. It's as if I'm only convenient for her when she's bored. Any suggestions on what should I do at this point? I don't want to assume. I don't want to let our friendship fall.

This love I hold for you is one of simplicity and purity, one that comes without effort. With it comes a child like innocence, for when I’m with you I nearly forget about the rest of the world. This love is something I know won’t die, for its not a fleeting feeling. Its one that is constant, and given the chance this feeling could grow into something truly beyond my own comprehension. Yet is this what true love can be? Are these feelings fabricated out of nothing, or are they rooted in something deeper that has not rose to the surface yet. These are what go through my mind when I get lost in your stare, the eyes are truly the most powerful thing a person can have. They show your intention and feeling even when you are unsure how you truly feel. The eyes are the windows to the soul and I’ve never seen eyes like yours. You’ve said you don’t feel the same, you love me as a friend and as a person, but the way you look back says so much more. I feel as if I should give up hope, yet something in me begs to hold on. You are such a rational and understanding person and I’m lucky to be with you in this regard, I long for more but am able to find solace in where we are now. For I can spend hours with you, just listening and talking, your company is one I never want to lose. Part of me feels you are my soulmate, but how can one feel like that and not the other. Is it dormant? Something that may awaken in time? I feel that answer will come after the London, there are answers there that will change whatever is between us for better or for worse. All I truly want is you happy, and if this is what it takes then continuing down this path I will. The path will change in January.",romance

"Alright ladies and gents of r/romance, I desperately need your help. So recently I met this girl. For the longest time, I'd given up on dating or romance as I'd lived a pretty crazy and some would even say fiction-like life on this earth. With all my experiences my head had taken to being stuck up in the clouds, whether as an escape or just due to loneliness and keeping myself company idk. So when our friends introduced us I just kind of figured she would be another friend and nothing more. However over the course of a couple of weeks as we got to talking I realized that she is literally the only person I've ever met who's had similar life experiences to me. As such a thing goes, we've been getting close. We're sort of an item now, but there's a problem. One of those experiences we have in common is a large number of parental issues. I don't mean this  as an edgy teenage 'I hate you mom and dad' way, but she lost her mother when she was young, and I my father, My mom is always busy now, working full time as a teacher and running a part-time tutoring business so I rarely ever see her and basically raised myself since I was 11. Her dad works a lot too but married another. Her stepmom is a little odd though. She restricts her from any communication via phone to any other people besides her and a handful of 2-3 girls that they've known for a long time. The reason, as far as I can tell, is being a helicopter parent but I'm not here to judge. The problem is we go to different high schools so they only times we get to talk is at football games and the occasional youth group party. So my question, what pieces of tech can I buy that would allow for basic texting, like a pager, but with a larger screen and two way sending? The best way I can think to describe it is like a pair of walkie talkies but for texting. Does anyone know of anything like this?",romance
"People of Reddit, what does it mean if a girl you like who somehow hints that she likes you back suddenly ignores you messages on messenger? This certain girl has been ignoring me for 4 days now and I've sent her a number of messages yet she continues to viee my stories. Is being on her period a valid reason to ignore me? What do you think is going on? Seems like she's ghosting me at this point. This fucking sucks. Should I wait a bit longer or just drop her? I already dropped some heavy hints on my posts but not a single shit was given. I'm tired of waiting for her reply. It really hurts deep inside but I'm trying not to affect me.

It all started really cool at first but now it feels like a hot and cold relationship.

 it really disturbs me. She now acts all distant. Why is she like this? What goes on?Someone pls slap some sense into me im utterly confused rn :(",romance

We see stories and movies and fairy tails that show characters falling in love in a variety of different ways. Some couples expected, some unexpected. Some of us want a happy ever after with somebody and try to find ‘the one’ to spend the rest of our lives with, but some of us fear it. Love is scary, it’s an adventure, it’s painful, it’s confusing, but most of all it’s a story. Everybody has a story, then when you fall in love with another person they become part of your story, apart of you. They can change the stories plot, ending, climax, etc. However, even the best relationships have a conflict in their story. Lucky for us though, a story has a climax which solves the conflict. Solving the conflict can change things for the better or for the worse. It can end relationships, fix relationships, improve relationships, or start relationships. It’s scary not knowing what’s going to happen. Once you start a story with somebody you are on the edge of your seat to see what happens and hope you achieve the ending you dream to have. It can be hard, some harder than others. Just because it’s hard it doesn’t mean you should give up. A challenge is good sometimes. It’s a scary challenge though. You soon realize that you would do anything and everything for a person. That somebody who may not have even been in your life for years, can one day enter your life and then you can’t go a day without them. You don’t want anything bad to happen to them, because they become a part of you that you cherish and hold onto as long as you can. You don’t want that taken away from you or anything happening to it. Then it can get harder, especially when your scared to face your fears. When your in love you fear getting hurt or hurting somebody else. You have to make tough decisions, and sometimes we make the wrong ones and it hurts. Certain decisions let you go back, however others don’t. They stick with you for the rest of your life. One decision can ruin a relationship, fix a relationship, or start a relationship. Loves not a game, you don’t want to be played with. You don’t play with somebody when your in love, it’s not a game so don’t treat it like it is.",romance

"First of all here is some context ( I'm a fairly small 5'1 lady in high school, I walk my friend home most of the time as my crush is right across the street from her house and I live five blocks away from them. I was recently touched inappropriately by a guy after walking my friend home, he and his two friends we're with him, but he was the only one touching my chest and ass, I asked him to stop repeatedly, but he wouldn't so I dropped my bag and fought him, let's call him Mike, Well I fought Mike and won then the next day was round two, I fought for a bit, but then had to get to my appointment in town. (I will be telling the other story literally right after this so it will make sense) So this guy I like, let's call him Owen, Well my best friend just left with my cousin aka her boyfriend, so It was My three friends and Mike. We met up with my one friend who was with his cousin and Mike went to go after one of the guys, Well he beat his ass and Mike was on the floor crying and yelling at the guy who beat him up. He obviously didn't learn his lesson because he went to go slap my ass again until owen who was right beside me saw and turned around and said ""don't"" And Mike backed off immediately, I was shaken up a bit so Owen walked with me to his house and said if anything happens where Mike comes back just tell him. It's been a day and Mike left me alone.) SECOND STORY ABOUT OWEN ( So I met owen through a friend group, it's slap ass month so I met him by my friend slapping my ass and owen joining in, a day goes by an we get a bit closer so maybe four days later when the fight goes on and all and Owen protected then I said see ya later and he said ""maybe"" So I hoped to see him, I went outside and waited hoping to see him, but I didn't so I was sad. I walked by the playground and Owen came running up to me, he was almost in a fight, and we walked alone until this girl who spread rumors about me a few years back came over to us holding a kitten, so he was being all cute with the kitten and took it home and told us to wait outside and we did, so he came back out and walked her home then me home, but he didn't leave we had an argument about what lockers are used for and then I don't know what happened, he started choking me, he wouldn't hurt me so he then would put his face close to mine and then licked my nose, he did it a lot, but then pulled me into a back hug and kissed my forehead, then I scooted closer to him and he said don't get closer, I thought he was gonna tickle me because he always tickles me, but instead he kissed me and I was freaking blushing out of my mind. He would always pull me into a hug or choke me and we would laugh, and then he helped me up onto the railing and called me short as he is 5'8 and freaking gave me a look this went on for an hour until he had to go, does this mean there is like one chance he likes me",romance
"I've recently found the band Hyber. [Look them up on all the places you find music] There is a song 'You Were' that strikes me like a love story with some identity issue keeping the singer from accepting their deep love. Then there is the song 'Funny' that seems to speak to post breakup strength. The song 'Good for me' speaks to a relationship from the unrequited. 

I was a deep romantic when younger and through many years of immaturity, selfishness and self destruction I became damaged and unfamiliar with the power and desire of deep romantic love. 

Listening to this band Hyber has helped to bring some romantic feels and even powerfully positive hope back.

"I landed myself a boyfriend a few months back and I love him so much. He sends me ""good morning, lovely"" messages everyday without fail and we have the best cuddle and Disney movie weekends. We aren't sexually intimate yet as we're both young (10th grade) and aren't completely comfortable with that, but we love each other just the same.
My problem is, whenever we makeout or just kiss, I'm always the one to initiate it. It seems minor, but sometimes I feel weird and almost dejected that he never wants to start kissing me. This may sound petty (I know I'm young and I haven't had much experience) but it bothers me a bit. When I confronted him about it, and asked him why he never kisses me first, he said that it was because he doesn't know how and the few times he's tried he ""felt strange"" or ""it didn't feel as good as the others or when I do it"" but I thought it was fine. I asked him if he was comfortable being intimate at all and he claimed he was, but it's still a bit off to me.

Although I really like him, I’m very introverted towards people I haven’t really talked to, and I have a fear of guys since I was little due to being sexually assaulted when I was younger, and my past crush (ended last year) turned out to be a huge jerk that thought he could abuse me just because he was in a bad mood.

"We walked onto the field and the guys whistled at us and yelled, “ ooo Zac got a thing with the manager.” And almost instantly Will turned his head at us and looked down to the ground almost as if he was trying to hide his reaction. Later that night Will texted me saying what’s up and I just blatantly told him, “ we’re not official or anything so you can talk to whoever you want.” He then replied,” is that bc you want to be official or you want to feel comfortable talking to other guys?” And I played it off saying “ it’s a heads up.”
 ((What I forgot to mention was the fact that the day before I walked onto the field with Zac, Will was telling me how I wasn’t like other girls and he loved that about me. He also admitted that he liked me and wanted me to wear his jersey to our first home game. ))
Fast forward 2 weeks the guys are talking about how Zac was gonna ask me out and how they would all slap him on the back in front of Will Saying things like “atta boy” and so Will knew the extent of our relationship. Zac asked me out and I said yes we became the IT couple on that team. Everyone shipped us and said we were so cute together well everyone but Will.  Fast forward again one month ( present time) Zac and I have already said we loved each other bc honestly we did or at least he did. We have a connection and time with him is amazing but up until last week when Will got hurt on the field and my heart dropped I was sure I only had feelings for Zac. But the more I thought about Will the more it made sense that I liked him. I’d look for him at Practice and would walk in front of him in the halls just so he can see me. But he doesn’t talk to me or at least it’s very minimal and Jake said that he thinks Will is just protecting himself from getting hurt. I don’t know why I want him to like me so much but I do. The past couple night have been me crying and wishing I have Will a shot even though I like Zac. I don’t know what happened. Zac is great but so is Will. I don’t know what to do. I want both of them and it comes down to who I like more. But if it’s Will why would I risk everything with a guy who loves me if I know Will doesn’t want to even talk to me ? Does he hate me ?

I think about him every second of everyday, but I don’t think he thinks of me much as he replies rather dryly and does not go out of his way to talk to me. Am I wasting my time?

Anyway I’m getting sidetracked the story starts when another varsity player (um Will) , Will texted Jake asking him for my Snapchat because he thought I was, “fineee.” When Jake told me that Will was interested I honestly was curious but not all that thrilled bc I had been crushing on Zac the star running back. Zac hadn’t asked me for my Snapchat or showed any interest so I went ahead and entertained Will. It wasn’t hard to do that either he was funny, expressive, and honestly pretty attractive. The more I talked with him the more I wanted him. We talked all day and all night but something was pulling me back from giving my all to him and that was Zac. I still had a crush on Zac and thought he’d be a better person to be with bc he’s hotter, the better athlete, and more popular. Part of me always looked at Zac even when I had Will.  Until one day Zac showed interest and I got his snapchat. Then I just dropped Will, no reason what’s so ever I just stopped talking to him. Then the next day at practice I had hung out with Zac prior to going to practice and we walked into practice together. We were late the whole team was on the field waiting and then ....

"HEY EVERYONE! HAPPY SUNDAY ☀️ 

Okay, thank God I’m feeling better this weekend. I’ve had the chance to think and ponder my situation and I think I’ve come to a decision, but let me update you first. 

Last week I was super discouraged because I thought that Mars would never like me or even see me as more than a sister. Also, I was certain that Pluto was catching feelings for me, so I was scared that that would make Mars not want to see me romantically. Well, after talking it over with Mars’ best friend that happens to be one of my best friends, Jupiter, I realized I was way too paranoid and I needed to get out of my own head. And so I did. 

I am a Christian and I really believe that God listens to me. Sometimes His answers aren’t what I would want, but I know they’re for my good. That being said, I decided that I would test God a little bit. I prayed with my girlfriends for a sign on whether or not I should back off. I told God that if Mars texted me back before I woke up, I would shoot mud shot this week. If Mars texted me after I woke up, I would shoot my shot before the semester was over. If he didn’t text me at all (I had been waiting for a response since Tuesday last week) then I would move on. 

I was really nervous because I really didn’t think that he would text me at all. The next morning I woke up and checked my phone. No text. I was crushed. I told God that it made me sad but if He saw it in His will to give me a chance with this boy, I would appreciate it. Anyway, I got up and started getting ready. After I showered, I started fixing my hair. ALL OF A SUDDEN MY PHONE BUZZED AND I SAW FIVE MESSAGES FROM MARS. FIVE! I’m geeking, but I am taking that as a sign that I gotta shoot my shot soon. 

That’s the story. I’m shooting my shot. I might get curved. I might not. I’m super nervous and stressed but hopefully it will all work out. I’ll keep you posted regardless. 

Thanks for listening, thanks for being there for me, thanks for being you.

I kind of don’t know how to make myself more like girly or appealing to guys. I see well put togethers girls all the time and how guys act around them, and I want the same attention too.

What do guys like about girls so much that I’m missing out on? Cause I feel invisible especially now.

He never borrows mine when we attend class although were always in the same class. But he always borrow mine when we attends club activity (were in the same club)

"So I met this girl and a fire has been lit. I feel immense motivation to pull out all the stops and to deploy the entire arsenel. Perceptions attitudes, authenticity, etc etc... Truth be told though I have limited vocabulary. I can talk my way through some lush conversations but I like when I'm on to the witty and fluid fun back and forthing. I'm not a big ladies man but I literally fell into a situation this weekend and something good is on the line...

I know a lot of what's best is circumstantial and in the moment and I get that. But I know that along the way we've all accumulated some effective lines that have made a s/o or a hot date happy. My intention isn't to seduce with unoriginal content.. No.. My intent is to provide a fulfilling experience. In life we are always accumulating and in taking external creativity/knowledge/stimuli to recycle into the world.

I'd like to take this opportunity to share some authentic/clever/funny/sexy lines to drop for fun while ya know out on a date, in the kitchen, in bed or out for a walk. For example from the movie Wanderlust ""I've got the fixens to fuck ya"" it's funny and if dropped with the right mood it's effective. Being sexy in an off handed way is effective. Another line from Dave chapelle ""this is some cirque de Soleil pussy"". I'm actually going to cirque de Soleil with this lady this month and I am fucking dropping that line.

"Hello all! Hope you are having a romantic time :)

I'll jump straight into it. I have been singing/working at a place for about 3 years. There is a girl there (I'll call her Samantha) who has been there for about 2 and I have developed a uh... pretty serious crush. I really enjoy being around her and talking to her gives me little pangs of happiness and in the glorious moments where we make eye contact it's like I'm a pathetic little schoolboy again.The routine of the place is always the same- and when she is there I always try to start a small conversation with her. We always seem to leave work at the same time and we have a nice little chat, I'll try to make an effort to talk to her, and she seems to laugh or chuckle at my dumb jokes (at least I think she does, I'm not sure if she's just being polite). But really, that's all it is. It never goes beyond the small talk...

And here is where it gets difficult.

Because of the place that we work at it would be weird if I asked her out there. When we leave to the train station I could ask her as we part ways to different platforms, but I guess it seems a bit rushy at a train station and I've never worked up the courage to ask her. I have thought about waiting at the same platform she is at to just extend the conversation- but my head tells me that is a little creepy.

It has got to the point where I have every reason to leave that job. The only reason I don't is because I might get to see Samantha, even thought the actually work is boring and I hate it, and there are some times that she isn't there.

She never really seems to be on messenger so sending a facebook message isn't really an option.

Advice anyone? How do I ask Samantha out? I haven't properly done this for 9 years.

"Hi you guys. V here. Hope everyone is doing great out there. Let’s just dive in, shall we? 

I’ve officially made it to the bro zone. Mars treats me like his bros and like his sister and I don’t know what to do about it. 

On another note, Pluto and I have gotten very close very fast. He is so sweet and gives me the kindest and sweetest attention I’ve ever gotten. I don’t have feelings for him and I don’t think he has feelings for me, but I love the way he treats me. I wish Mars treated me like that...

Anyhow, I have a tutoring session with Mars tomorrow and I’m going to attempt to look very cute and act very cute so that maybe he can take a second look and be like, “hmm, she’s pretty alright.” 

Well, that’s all the updates I have for now. If anything happens tomorrow, I will let all of you know. And if you have any advice, please comment. I would love to hear your thoughts.

"Let's start with I am a freshman guy in college and to begin with some background, I never had a relationship in high school or anything before that. But when it comes to my friend group, all my friends have had or been in relationships. I've always been the guy that people come to when they want to talk and honestly, it was nice to be there for me through the greatest times and worst times.  I slept over at my best friend's house for 3 days because he was depressed about his first breakup. That was a heart-melting experience for me because what I saw him do or at least try to do to himself. As I write this, it takes me back to those moments and I feel now what I felt then. 

Now, as a freshman in college and being away from home, I want to put my self out there. However, as of lately it's been no luck. I know it is only the beginning of the semester still and I still my whole life ahead of me but sometimes when I sit down at my computer or do my homework I get lost in time. My emotions take over and being 18 and young, it feels like the world is ending sometimes. Today Sunday, September 29, 2019, was the longest day of my life. My roommate's girlfriend left this morning to go back to their home state and it hit me. I spent the day with them yesterday because they invited me and being in the car with them made me kinda sad. Seeing my roommate goes from College Student to this childish man made me think he has got what he is looking for. 

I think to myself, I want that but I know it will take time. I am a firm believer in things happening for a reason and that good things come to those who wait but sometimes waiting is a torture in itself. Time doesn't seem to be moving at all and I am sitting in my office chair lost in a desolate mirage of reality. For some reason, this feeling hit me like a truck today. It hit me harder than it ever has. In the past, I've understood that I am young and a whole life ahead of me. I have been able to shrug it off and stay positive in the past but today is different. I am not ready to go to sleep and take on another week of school. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, for now, I am writing to let my emotions go, let my tears type the thoughts I have held on for years. An end will come one day and I hope to have a ""fairytale"" ending but for now, I am stuck in my own thoughts and place. Tomorrow will come and I hope to breakthrough another period of this feeling. Time will pass and I know that I will find my true love. The ocean is a large place and sometimes we can get lost along the way. Sometimes I say to myself, in order to find where you are, you need to get lost. Who knows what you and I will find but I hope the best for everyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Reddit is my ultimate stress reliever. When I am feeling the saddest or angry I come here and read the stories or read the ""NEED advice"" posts and I let my body take over. Takeover from the pain my mind makes me feel.

"Hey everyone, I hope everything is going well. 

I know it’s been a minute and I apologize. I’ve been trying my best to live in the moment and just experience life, especially with Mars. 

Over the past few weeks, Mars and I have been texting pretty much every day and he’s been tutoring me and honestly, I thought things were going pretty great. We went to a concert together and had a blast, it was the highlight of my year. For a minute there I even thought he might like me... but as always I was wrong. 

Mar’s roommate, let’s call him Pluto, and I are super good friends. The other day we were on the phone and he tells me that Mars is interested in this other girl called Saturn. That really threw me because I really thought things were going super great. After Pluto told me about that, I realized that I’d unintentionally worked my way past the friend zone and into the worst zone of all time: the BRO ZONE. 

I’m doomed I know, but the helpless romantic in me still holds out hope. I texted Mars two days ago and told him I thought he was super cool and cute and he still hasn’t even responded. I’m really not even sure how to interact with him anymore guys, but I’m going to try my best to be cute and casual. 

The moral of the story is: don’t get bro zoned, especially on a bad week. My anxiety has been tweaking and I’ve literally had three existential crises over the past week. It’s fine though, I’m gonna bounce back and even if it doesn’t work out, at least I’ll have cool fail story to tell... right??

"Here's the situation:

I've been talking to this guy for about two months on Whatsapp. Since we started talking, it was pretty clear that we were into each other and decided to have a conversation about our feelings. We agreed to explore it and see where it would take us. We have long conversations throughout the day. Some of our conversations consisted of our personalities, school, work, things we like and don't like, intellectual conversations, and sexual ones (quite a few times) etc. He says that he's really into me, and I reciprocate that same feeling. Here's the thing, we haven't met in person yet, and we plan to but given that I am a monogamous person, I would like to have a conversation about being exclusive the first time we meet or at least, about how uncomfortable it makes me feel when the person I'm talking to is talking to multiple people. To me, that's disrespectful, and I wouldn't want to waste my energy and time if he is considering other romantic or sexual partners. In other words, I would feel led on. Would you have this conversation the first time you meet in person, or wait a little? Why, or why not? Please take into consideration my situation. 

When we first started talking, I did not think about this as much until a particular conversation we had over whatsapp. This is how the conversation went:

I said, ""Don't you have work today?"" (Forgot it was a Saturday)

He said, ""No, lol. Are you sure you're in the right chat?""

I said, ""Yes, and lol, I thought you did.

He said, ""I don't work today. And lol, you're probably talking to another dude""

I said, ""Hmm, no, I'm only interested in you.""

He said, ""I like that, but I wouldn't want to limit you the freedom of getting to know other people you might be interested in."" 

To me, this doesn't mean that he might be talking to other people, but it implies the idea that he's okay with it and probably thinks it's okay to do that, when I'm not. Mind you, this conversation took place about two weeks ago. 

What are you thoughts on this? I would really appreciate a response.",romance
"I have two, what I consider to be, very close friendships. One person I met when we were four years old and the other I met when we were eleven. The three of us remained close throughout our schooldays before going off to college where we still kept in touch and followed the trajectory of each others lives. I feel like these people have been part of my life for so long that it's as natural to be around them as it is my own sister. While we do share some interests, I believe our friendship is based more on having similar personalities and attitudes towards how we go about life. The three of us are very much cut from the same cloth in that sense. I can typically always relate with the things they're feeling because if I were in their shoes I imagine myself reacting a similar way.

But still despite us all being twenty-five years old, when they turn to me and say they have a boyfriend it's like this wall goes up that I can't see behind. I always wonder ""how did that happen?"" What in your interactions with someone causes you to want to enter into a partnership arrangement? What is the incentive? Similarly, when I am being pursued by someone with intentions for a partnership agreement I struggle to understand what it is they want from me or see in me that is making them act like this. I have never been friends with these people. In fact, our interactions had always been pretty minimal prior to the actual courtship process. Do they think I am pretty? Do they think I say interesting things? Do they want to have sex with me? Do I have certain life resume that make me a good candidate for marriage? Do I remind them of their mother?

Everyone I knew in college would spend time scrolling through Tinder just as they would scroll through Twitter, an endless search for... what, exactly? For some I can see why a romantic partnership would make sense, usually if it is in line with their goals. I know some people who want nothing more than to get married, have kids, and buy a very specific type of house. Finding romantic chemistry with someone is pretty pivotal for that happening. But for many more people I'm left to assume that they're on some sort of autopilot: the only life outline they've been shown is one where a romantic partner becomes one's primary relationship or maybe they meet someone who makes them feel fuzzy and they think ""why not?"" 

For me not only am I seemingly not attracted to people but none of my life goals require an emotional partnership. If anything, an emotional partnership would just make being truly happy in achieving my life goals more difficult. I simply don't understand what makes a partnership so appealing or rather... I don't understand why there isn't more of a diversity in preference. Maybe if one third of people I meet in life found partnership to be the most appealing relationship arrangement whereas another third instead thrived contributing to communities and another third just liked the best to coast by themselves. That array makes sense to me. But it's not like that. Everyone is seemingly searching for this thing and I don't understand any of it and when I ask no one seems to be able to explain.",romance

"She was trying to finish an entire semester worth of Political Thought in a matter of three afternoons. Of last minute preparations, she was the fucking queen. Pushing with irregular kicks a big stool to sit on, and a small one to rest her feet on, she proceeded to her small but cozy L-shaped balcony. The sun was a welcome friend to beat the winter nip.

With her back to the wall adjacent to her door, she comfortably positioned herself, and picked up the first chapter, ten pages roughly torn from a spiral binding, held together firmly by two staple pins. One could read Plato only for so long, she looked up to scan her eyes through the houses of the society facing hers. Clothes drying outside balconies, children playing, women talking across balconies, nothing caught her eye. She tried to bring her focus back to wise old Plato. Abruptly disturbing her short spanned focus came her mother into the balcony with a glass of buttermilk, her favorite afternoon drink. She drank, as her mother proceeded to hang clothes to dry.

She began looking at the houses, and a peculiar potted plant caught her eye, it looked vaguely familiar, yet odd. She asked her mother about it, who did not seem to be able to place it.

She continued to study till the sun was out, after which she went inside and nothing interesting happened to her till the next evening.

Next evening, she went outside to accompany her mother who was out drying clothes, an everyday feature, when the peculiar potted plant was made very interesting by the man behind it, watering it. Fair, bearded, penetrating eyes and an uncanny, mysterious handsomeness. He was the kind of man your mother warns you against. It began raining soon after, and she went outside, only to be welcomed by the view of four bachelors standing in that very balcony. It was strange, as hardly any residential society rented out to bachelors. But, who was she to complain?

She didn’t see him for the next couple of days, much to her disappointment. She told her mother, who she was very close to, who banged the latch of the balcony door three times and laughed it off, saying that the guy will be out in a matter of seconds, and walked back into the house. Her laughter hadn’t yet died and the man was out in the balcony, with a sleepy face, rubbing his eyes with a confused look on his face, looking at her. She couldn’t believe he actually came out to the sound of a door’s latch.

And it began.

In a matter of days, it became their signal, their call, and he would go out whenever he would hear the door latch bang against the hard metal of her balcony door. His door was only wooden, so he would cough instead, and she would go running out, and they would stare at each other for hours, pretending they were just hanging out in their balconies, unaware of each other’s presence.

Days turned into weeks, and their affair deepened. A persistent cough, a door latch banging, followed by hours of time spent in their balconies where would pretend to be out for a smoke, and she would pretend to be enjoying her playlist whilst walked to and fro. Every time she would turn while walking, she would catch a front glimpse of him, looking at her, with a tension between them that one could slice through, only to find a passion that could burn anyone who came in between whatever they had.

Soon they had the confidence to stare straight into each other’s eyes, and she felt as if he was looking right into her soul, she felt a raw, uncontrollable emotion she couldn’t quite name.

It surely couldn’t be love, as she was dating this one guy who had caught her attention for years.

The boyfriend came over one afternoon, and as they sat out in her balcony enjoying the warm sun, the mysterious man came outside and looked at her. He went back inside as fast as he had come out, and she couldn’t understand why… was he jealous?

If he was, then this affair was too far deep to be reigned back in.

She spent a wonderful day with her beau, who before taking her leave, pulled her into a warm embrace as they stood in her room, and left her with a kiss on the lips. As they parted, she realized her balcony door had been open all along, and ‘he’ might have witnessed her with another man. She ignored the thought, she hadn’t done anything wrong, and went downstairs to see her beau off. While walking back up to her apartment, she saw him sitting on the boundary wall of his balcony, look at her and then look away. In that moment, she realized he had witnessed her hugging and kissing another man and was upset about it.

She went out in the balcony, and hoped he would look at her, but he didn’t. She coughed, but he didn’t look. She decided, two could play this game. Armed with a small blanket to keep her from catching a cold, and her stool, she went and sat outside. It was a long night, he was upset, and she was guilty. They both stayed out the entire night, ignoring each other, in the bitter cold. He didn’t budge from his spot on the boundary wall, nor did she, except for the occasional stroll. After some five hours, into the early hours of the morning where the sky was still dark, he got up, went inside, and then she saw him leave the building. She felt she did her best to make up for what had upset him, without using any words. She cried herself to sleep at night, torn in her heart about what she felt, and for which man her feelings were stronger.

She woke up the next morning, only to find him sitting with a girl in his balcony. She felt jealous, but guessed she deserved it. Her mother, who had been witnessing all this, felt that enough was enough, asked her to call whatever was going on, off. The very thought brought her to her knees for he had become a part of her day, her night, her dreams. Every afternoon while returning from college, she would look up before entering her building, to find him looking at her from above, she would spend hours walking in her balcony in the evenings, for that one look of him which she would catch when she turned to his side of the balcony.

It wasn’t just her though, she was a part of his day too. He would leave for his job every evening and cough before he did so, for she would come in the balcony and he would see her one last time for the night. As he walked out of the building with his friends, he made sure he was the last to leave, so he could look up at her balcony, into her eyes, and not have his friends notice it. He didn’t want them to see her, she was his.

The mother was firm, it had to end. So she went outside, coughed, he came out, and with a signal of hands, she conveyed that they could no longer continue what had gone on for so long, as she was in a relationship with a guy one could not flaw. He looked surprised at first, since she was attempting to make conversation. Till now, all their volumes were spoken only by the eyes. His expression soon turned to that of sadness, and he went back inside. So did she, but not before she had broken down in an ocean of tears. Days passed by, and she didn’t see him in the balcony. She saw his friends, but never him.

This one cloudy evening, fate gave her another chance to make a choice. She saw him standing in the balcony, his back towards her, smoking a cigarette. She went outside, no longer was she in charge of logic or reason. She was far behind any rationality, and in too deep. She prayed for him to turn, and just as he did, their eyes met. She signalled him to stop, and he did, and watched her hold her ears to ask for an apology, which he ever so readily afforded her, by smiling wide at her. Their saga resumed.

They no longer pretended to not acknowledge what was happening between them, and they started straight at each other every evening. He never left for work without seeing her once, till this one particular evening.

She had gone to the market that evening, and knew that he would be waiting for her. As she walked back to her building, she saw him, on the road, outside a cab, taking to the driver. Their eyes met, he smiled, entered the cab, and went his way. She then realized, this affair had transcended attraction, it was so much more than that. He couldn’t leave without seeing her.

A few evenings later, as she was walking in her society, she saw him in his classic red hoodie, as she approached the main gate. Her pace slowed, as did his. He was only a few metres away from her, separated only by a massive iron gate. Neither could gather to courage to move towards each other. What would they say? They had experienced everything a traditional relationship does, a meeting, their own language, flirting, jealousy, a short break, and a rekindling of the same romance, which had only emboldened them.

What does one say in words after having said so much without them? Their relationship had transcended words, it was unique, extraordinary, and neither wanted to jinx it. Their bond was surreal, and words would make it all too real.

Came New Year, and he got drunk, very drunk. He walked out in his balcony and coughed. He shouted out, asking for her to come out. He kept shouting hello, and asking loudly why she wasn’t coming out. It pained her to see him like this, and all she wanted was to do as he asked, but was afraid, as it was past midnight, and had she gone, who knew what else he might say.

All this while, her heart was drowning in guilt, for she loved someone else too, in a different way, but it was love all the same. She didn’t mean for any of this to happen, and she didn’t know what to do. She made a choice after moistening many tissues, courtesy her swollen eyes, and chose her boyfriend as the one she would stay with. But her mystery man was making it difficult for her to stay true to her decision, so she dropped a letter to his society’s office, complaining about the drunken ruckus and drug use the bachelors staying in their society were indulging in.

She couldn’t take it back now, she had cut the cord on their affair. She watched his friends carry luggage and their precious plant into an auto and leave, and he wasn’t there. She went to college the next, and came home to find her mother with the most extraordinary story. Her mother had heard a lot of coughing from outside, and upon going out in the balcony, she had found the bachelor pacing about in his balcony, looking at their balcony. He had apparently waited a long time, before eventually leaving. She broke down again, she didn’t get to say goodbye, and he was gone.

Come next morning, she heard a cough. Afraid to get disappointed, she stayed in bed. Hope got the better of her, she got up, put on her spectacles, and ran out to the balcony, to find him standing in his. She cried, and he saw, and they stayed that way for some time. He then went back inside and so did she, unsure of what to do next. She was deeply attached to him, and it made no sense, for they never had had what one might call a real conversation.

A couple of hours later, she heard a cough, and ran out, to find him standing inside his room, the window ajar. His friend was standing alongside him, considerably out of view. They looked at each other, with pain in their eyes, for their relationship was moments away from its end. He stared at her, taking in the last look to last him for all days to come, and his friend had to nudge him from his daze, the window had to be closed, they had to go, and I had to be left behind as a love with no name.

Reluctantly he slid his window shut, as slowly as he could manage, never taking his eyes off her, as she stood, praying for time to stand still. She knew she would see him leave the building for the very last time, which he did, but he did not look up. He just walked away.

Maybe they lacked the courage to make themselves a possibility, or maybe they had the courage to let go. They were far beyond what words could achieve, and they would have done no good. Where would they have gone from there? They knew nothing about each other, not even each other’s names, but they had still loved each other in their own twisted way, and felt all emotions any great relationship has to offer.

Not all love stories reach their happily ever after. They just are, magnificent in their fiery passions that burn bright but never forever.

And to think it all started with the darned cannabis plant that had caught her attention as she struggled to read what wise old Plato had to offer on one very ordinary winter afternoon.",romance

"Okay so I have a really close friend (we'll call him Tom) who I think I may have caught feelings for. We met last year in College and quickly became very close we were constantly together to the point that all of our friends thought we were ""together"". I was constantly being asked if I liked him and always shut it down and said that I had a crush on someone else and this was also during the time I was helping Tom pursue a relationship with one of my friends. So we've always talked about other people we were both interested in and were strictly friends, that was until the towards the end of the year when I realized that maybe I do have feelings for him that aren't platonic. I began to notice just how much I truly care about him and how the thought of him with another girl really makes me sad. Whenever i told him that everyone thinks I like him he would ask if I do and I always said no so he still thinks I only view him as a friend. I was hoping that over the summer my feelings would subside and we could go back to being the good friends we were but I just kept thinking about him all summer and now that we're back in university I'm feeling them even more than I did last year. Some of our friends are even still making comments that nothing changed over the summer and they think I still like him however I continue to deny it. I honestly don't know what to do because I value him so much that i don't want him to find out and things get hella weird between us. He's just a genuinely great friend who has been there for me in some really hard times and someone I could always rely on. And honestly i know he doesn't return the feelings so I'm afraid that if I tell him it would make what I'm feeling too real and no longer just a thought in my head. Oh and to top things all off I live with him and our friends who think I like him. (okay this post was kind of a mess)",romance

"We dated long enough to be in love she showed all the signs she was , I know I was/am. I knew she had lost her mom to cancer in 2015 in a long battle. My mother was diagnosed with Agressive cancer and I would talk to her about it. I consider her interaction on this to be supportive. Flash forward my mother has 4 weeks to live. I have to fly out to say goodbye to my mom. I make a date to squeeze a couple hours in  to see her the night before I have to leave to be gone for several days. 

Two hours before our date she calls and says she is very popular with several asking her to go to happy hour. It was a Friday afternoon, she’s an attractive school teacher. I’m shocked, but rather than get in a argument, I say ok and I hang up. I stew on it and after I packed  my bags to go see my dying mother, I sent her a text expressing my surprise she would choose to go to happy hour when I needed to be with her. I didn’t think expecting someone who says she loved me would back out for a drink with someone(s) she does not romantically love. 

Flash forward, my mother passed and this woman sees nothing wrong with dumping me for happy hour with whoever.  She expects to continue where we left off with a cold apology and a tough shit attitude. I see this is a indication she is seeing someone else or she is just a selfish, heartless woman. I have no reason to believe she is seeing someone else.

"(first time posting pls be nice)

I heard my mom watching some bad comedy sketch on Facebook (I know, already off to a great start) about how the elderly/family/etc pictures always told a story, whereas the kind of stuff you see on Instagram (i.e. food, selfies, etc) do not. This popped up in my head about a month later and I thought about how absolutely untrue that could possibly be. Yeah, sure, most of the time it might not have substance, but what about the times there is?

”Hey, Grandma, why did you take a picture of your dinner?” “Oh, this? Oh! I remember that! That was at a hibachi restaurant with your grandpa! At the time, this was our third date, and...”

”Dad, why‘d you take a selfie of you in a suit?” “Funny story, actually. I was trying on a suit for my first date with my first boyfriend, and I wanted to see how I looked. I was really nervous that I was going to look stupid or say something weird, but...”

”Hey, Auntie Anna? What’s this selfie with you and Uncle Pat?” “Oh, this one was from when we went on our second date at a coffee shop! It’s funny, really - most people go for the coffee shop first, but the first was a carnival - anyway...”

"**First time posting here...,**  
Dunno where to start fellas, but I really am feeling that I can't talk about this with anyone in my inner circle that would understand what I really mean and I hope you, as the readers, will understand this in some way.Also, I already had a couple of conversations concerning this subject, but it was always the same response from my friends, chase her, tell her you like her yadi yadi yada

Also note, I'm that type of romantic guy that will try and indirectly show that I care for the girl if she starts to give me those small signals and those ""test"" questions. Y'all know what I'm talking about (hopefully...)and I can build easily emotional connections with chicks ( not to brag about it or anything but I really developed this shit through experience let's say)

I'll start explaining;

so I got into a situation where I met this girl let's call her K (easier to understand for y'all)and it all began in the summer when K came over to my house thanks to a friend of my brother.Basically the scenario played like this;I go on my terrace with a friend of mine and suddenly I see there's this girl, K, and when our eyes met, I felt a direct connection with her( we could call this love on first sight).Afterwards, you could see me sitting down next to her on my terrace, while there were other dicks around let's say, but I didn't care much at the time about the people around me, it was just my curiousness that took **me** over.

I wanted to get to know her, so we started doing small talk etc... Fast forward I got her snapchat one day and then we started vibin step by step.Next thing you know, she sends me her phone number (happy yay), which indicates I'm playing the right cards.

Then one day she asks me to meet up, but at the time I was with a homie of mine and so I asked her if she was aight with it, she said OK.Fast forward, we vibin with 3, and when she arrives, our eyes meet again and that night she couldn't stop looking in mine.

My friend told me that btw, because I asked him what he thinks about her ( since y'all fellas gotta know that if a future gf doesn't vibe with your close friends, you better next her) and he tells me, DUDE she was all into you !!!

next thing I know we talk about the deep stuff, we got that emotional connection smoothly going, so you can imagine you meet this X girl and you and her exchange ideas dreams etc and you feel like you two are going somewhere.

I decide one day to meet for a date then, but she was on vacation for a couple of days, so i had to maintain those positive vibes with her, u feel me guys?

Fast forward again, the day she comes back in town, she texts me I'M BACK.We then normally had to see eachother that night but I was in the wrong time and wrong place let's say.Finally, I call her to tell her let's do something fun and so see agrees to see me later that night.We then go out to a bar not far away ( ALSO SMALL DETAIL I FORGOT TO MENTION, SHE LIVES 5MIN AWAY FROM ME ) and get a couple of drinks, smoke a J and then she tells me to get over to her place...

I then agreed and went on to hers, she tells me no one is home till tomorrow evening ( her mom is out of town )so we start vibin chilling with some music, getting to know her personally this time.She shows me personal writings of her that she had to do for school once and I felt that complex mind of hers. She also read them out loud and I read one as well out loud, which leads me to start thinking she's that type of that girl could like a letter ( i'll write about the letter at the end)

the problem is I don't kiss chicks on the first date.. but I think I should've done it with K. I also think that i'm fucking things up right now and tripping too hard on this chick ( overthinking )

Which leads me to the present;I am going in a couple of days on vacation ( on the 17th) and I thought to drop by her house before going on vacation and slip in a letter with my confession ( that romantic stuff...) about simply being with her and that in those couple of months that I ""spent"" with K, i felt that she could be the type of girl that could push me towards my goals and I could be that person for her and simply put, say that I love her and I think honestly that she would appreciate this because of the letters thing she showed me ( I think it was an indirect way of her showing me she cares about me since it was really personal stuff) and it's kinda cute in my opinion ( don't know what you're thinking bout this one guys and girls..)

So the question is am I a fucktard that overthinks and overanalyses this shit? Or am I a tard that is in love and should still write this letter?

I could use any help...

SO PLEASE ANY ADVICE WOULD BE APPRECIATED

P.S. : our vibe rn is kinda chill I'm not pushing on anything but I think I should still do *something (that something is writing that handwritten letter)* before I take my plane(I know people live seperate lifes and that she may be busy planning stuff, sorting her life out, etc I'm just thinking about her too much lately and I think she feels something for me but she's shy asf... also I'm thinking if not now then when) and college/uni starts again... which means I think we're going to be seperated ( since she's attending another school than me) and we'll be taking our own ways...

P.P.S. : This might sound crazy but I really like this girl and I think that we could be a nice relationship if I don't fuck up and find some omen or answer here hopefully",romance

"Hi. I’m Venus. Okay, that’s not my real name but anonymity is a thing, so yeah. You can call me V. And I’m trying to win over my crush. But let me give you some background info so you can kinda be more up to speed on my life.

I’m a college student in a pretty rural area and I’m a pretty down to earth girl. Back in high school, I met a ton of people who ended up coming to the same college as me, as some stories go. Now my crush, Mars (not his real name), is a year below me. Yeah, yeah, I know, weird. But he’s a super cool guy. Back in high school, him and I would chill because he was pretty dope. I guess you could say that’s when my crush started. 

Fast forward a few years and here we are. Both in college. He’s still a year below me, but it seems to matter less now. He and I roll in similar groups, so we hang every once in awhile. I wanna win his heart, but I’m not sure how... I guess that’s why I’m documenting it so that you guys can follow with me and I can have some support. 

Let me tell you about Mars. Mars is tall, light skinned, super talented and goofy. Mars has dimples and an auspicious nose. Mars has curly hair and smiling, warm, inviting eyes. Mars  mocks me but he doesn’t mean it. Mars has a face etched by Michelangelo himself. Mars has the kindest heart I have ever known. And the last thing you need to know is this: Mars has my heart.


I don’t know if Mars know how I feel, and I’m not gonna tell him just yet, but I am currently in the process of getting him to tutor me so that we can spend more time together. I’ll keep y’all posted with any updates. 

Love, 
Venus",romance

"I feel as if though im never going to find my significant other. And mainly because i have severe social anxiety. Ive had crushes say they like me but i turned them down or didn't say anything at all because i thought they were to good for me. And it doesn't help that my dream is to be a successful singer/songwriter, and that i want to move to england. I feel like a long distance relationship would not be good and also feel like as a starving artist i would not be able to provide for them. Ive read books that get the two main characters together and it talks about their relationship and i want somthing like that so bad. I just need love. And i need help.",romance
18 years old and I still have a crush on a girl who has already rejected my confession on several occasions.

"Recently I got a crush on this guy and he’s a super outgoing and kind person, an amazing human being. The problem is that I’m super shy towards crushes! I’m able to talk a lot when I’m with close friends or even strangers but when I’m with my crush I’m so so quiet even though I want to talk to him so much. Does anyone have advice on how to talk to a guy? ;-; I’m so bad with conversations",romance
"Me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 2 years. We usually never fight not have issues but when we do, they are never easy. Our fights never get physical or anything but they always end with me crying and feeling pretty crappy and blaming myself. We don't have many problems in our relationship except for the fact he doesn't sleep over my house and we both have trust issues. We have come far on our trust issues but it feels like we are slipping back into them. In regards to the sleeping over, I live alone and he is more than welcome over. He used to sleep over frequently and now its like pulling teeth to even talk about it. I would be more than happy to spend nights at his but its not an option as his living situation doesn't allow it. I have tried to communicate my feelings towards it but always get met with the same answers. We both have crazy schedules but have always made time for each other and done cute things for each other. I noticed things start to change toward the end of spring and feel as though the effort is not the same. It almost feels like I am getting half if not less at points than before. I miss a lot of the little things he would do for me. I miss the small notes and gifts. I miss the cards and the texts telling me how much he loves me. I miss the reassurance and the actions to match. We both have been through so many things together and a lot of firsts and this is the first time I have felt like this.

"Have u ever heard the phrase “Time Stopping Beauty??”...Its when u see something so BEAUTIFUL it makes u stop in ur tracks to gaze upon it...it can be anything from a piece of art, a scene in nature, landscape, PEOPLE...Its SO captivating that everything around u ceases to exist...and because of it everything just stops...”time” itself is irrelevant..there for “Time Stopping Beauty.”...This happened to me when I first met Holly...In fact every time I see her its like seeing her for the FIRST TIME all over again!!...Im stopped dead in my tracks!!...But its not just surface its intrinsic as well...Her inner beauty is matched ONLY by the sparkle in her eyes, and the smile she flashes, (which incidentally could light up Manhattan)...In fact Im so enamored by her beauty that oft times she’ll be telling me something and Im not paying full attention..which has caused some “raised” eyebrows from her....the mere thought of her, or mention of her name gives me pause in my thoughts...AGAIN “Time Stopping Beauty!!”...Its my wish that everyone experiences this at least once in their lives!!",romance
"Today after class I ran into my ex bf. It's kind of bitter sweet. When we dated everything was great but there was always the age issue and the fact that hes my brothers best friend.  Hes only 4 years older than me making him 23 almost 24 . I was fine with it really . We broke up because he was v flirtatious with others . Anyways we didnt do anything but currently I'm at his house as I write this . He has 42 freckles and soft brown lashes that lightly touch his cheek. Tiny wisps of hair that sway back and forth from the gust of air he let's out . I used to love that he didnt snore . Even loved that he had a habit of clutching the closest thing to him. Its moments like this that bring old memories. I'm going to sleep now, I just thought I'd share this .",romance
"oh god, not even sure how to start this. 

I met this guy online (I know bad start) we just started talking and getting to know each other. We created a friend circle and got along with everyone. However, I was told by one of the mutual friends that this guy and I would be a really cute couple. I could see it and agreed. I started pushing him a bit more, to see if he liked me or not. I received enough info that was in my favor and said ""I like you"" to him one day. He said that he felt the same but because of our age difference (and me being a minor) we decided to not really be a thing. Then suddenly one day a month after we expressed how we felt about each other I received a group text from him showing he booked a hotel near where I lived. I was kind of really freaked out. Like, we hadn't talked to each other about this. He just decided he was coming. I shrugged off how I felt and rolled with it. Two months went by and the big date came! I was going to meet him irl. I was scared to death! I asked a friend to track me while I was out and if I don't responded to her texts then something was wrong. So everything was going fine, awkward, but fine. We ended up walking to our cars and he stopped. I could feel what was coming. We hugged and uncomfortable hug. I tried to leave and said something like ""well better get going"" but he just starred at me. I was like sheet. I went a bit closer to my car and went further away from him. We were like three feet apart. Then all of a sudden he started moving closer to me with his eyes closed and his lips puckered up. I panicked and yelled ""NO!"" He looked shocked. IDK why but I started laughing, said goodbye and left. Since then I've lost all attraction I kind of had and just don't really know what to do. Break up with him? But how?

"So recently this summer I’ve been talking to a girl that I knew for 5 years. I obviously have feels for her and I decided to build the courage to ask her out over the phone. When I did she said “ If we get to hang out more, maybe”. But I never really get to see her too much( she has plenty of friends) and I feel like the relationship is dying. How do I get her attention and how do I get things started?",romance
"Soooo....I had a new neighbor move in about a month or ago, and initially I only saw her when walking to my car, taking the trash out, etc. We exchanged ""hellos"" and other small talk briefly but that's it. However, a couple weeks ago I got off work on a Saturday and get a knock on the door. It's her, she stopped by under the pretense of asking a question about the guys that had painted our houses but ended up staying over for about 45 minutes talking and getting to know each other. We both agreed to get up later that night (which we did). Since then, she has been over literally EVERY single night. Nothing physical has happened yet, but her body language suggests to me that she may be into me. I'm really bad at reading things, but her eagerness to be around me all the time and the fact she is either at my place or I'm at hers almost every night tells me *something*. There was also one night when I was gone and she knocked on the door and my roommate answered and she inquired if I was out with ""some girl"". She is really inquisitive and intuitive, and hangs on every word....like, she will remember something I told her in passing from weeks ago that I don't even remember telling her.

We really gel well, she is beautiful, and single. Perfect right? Well, there are a few wrenches in the gears. For one, she hangs out with my roommate too when she's over (obviously, since he lives here), and when she invites me over she feels it necessary to invite him over too (as to not be rude). While he likes her plutonically, he has assured me time and time again that he's not interested in that regard but does value the friendship they have so far. She is aware of the fact he has a constant on-and-off relationship with his ex, and has met her as well, so I don't see her pursuing my roommate. I get plenty of alone time with her but am also scared to make any kind of move just simply because she's my neighbor. If I have misread things it would be terribly awkward and I wouldn't want to ruin a potential good friendship if things didn't go well. But I keep getting signs, and it has me emotionally confused to say the least. She is definitely what you would call a ""good girl"", and I can't picture her making the first move. We've shared our past relationships and talked openly about sex and things of the sort so I know she isn't a ""prude"" per say. Everyone I have talked to has told me she's waiting for me to show that I'm interested and not to expect her to make any moves. I'm just so confused as to what to do.

We definitely have chemistry, and I'm aware that if she didn't like me in some way she wouldn't be hanging around all the time. She has gotten more flirty, personal, and physically playful as of late but I am terrified of making the wrong move. I mean, maybe she's just really friendly? I don't know. Normally I can read these situations pretty easily, and most of the girls I have dated/been with have made their feelings obvious after a period of time, but she's different. I'm physically and mentally attracted to her equally. If my roommate wasn't around so much I think it would be a lot easier to gauge, but I can't say. All I know is I'm definitely catching feelings and I don't know how to approach it with this girl. I want to lay it on the line about how I feel so I don't miss my chance or seem like I am not interested but also don't want it to be too premature and scare her off. I'm sorry if this post has rambled on, any advice on what signs to look for or how to approach this somewhat delicate situation would be appreciated. Cheers to all",romance

"So incase you've read what I wrote a week or two ago, here's the rest if the story that is sure to continue. 

So last Friday Night as those of you who read the story I wrote know, I hangout with my crush a second time and wasn't sure if it was a date or a hangout with friends. This past friday night I invited him to come towards the end of my shift at the face painting place, and he did. (I painted a flame and a pair of red lips on his hands🤭). Anyhow my shift ends and we go to the bleachers (this was a football scrimmage) to sit with his friends. We had a little fun, but then we just ended up facing eachother talking rather than talking with the group of friends. Then he suggested we go get snow cones, we go and this time I wasn't even prepared to pay for myself. Anywho, his friends ditched the game. And I suggested we go to the visitor's side cause I've always wanted to do that for some reason. On the way this old man stops us and asks me ""did he buy that snow cone for you?"" I was like ""yes"" and he was like ""that's what we old people call a date, that is unless he is your older brother"" I jokingly reply ""yep he's my brother"" and put my hand on his bicep. After that I was like ""he's not wrong you know, traditionally that would be a date"". Anywho we go to the other stands and this special ed girl joins us, I was happy to have her there at first but then things started getting awkward. I was so paranoid she could tell something was going on between us. Then she got upset cause she thought I didn't like her, which she tells Micheal after I walk away when she was trying to tell M that she thought this. He walks up to me and was like ""do you hate her?"" (In a totally insincere way cause he knew I didn't) so I go talk to her and decide to tell her no I don't hate her but yes I do want time alone with him cause I like him. So skip forward we all go back to the bleachers towards the top, and she acted so weird and kept winking at me. After some silence she's like I'm gonna go then whispers to me encouraging me to just tell him, he gets curious about what we were talking about. Then asks what was going on, and she gets all flustered and blurts out that she want me to tell him that SHE likes him and i tried really hard to cover it up and play it cool. But he saw through it and asks her to give us a second alone. And she was devastated because of what she had just done (and leaves). He scoots down next to me and was like ""Soo, are you gonna tell me what that was all about"". By that time I was curled up into a ball watching the game. My stomach was being tied in knots every which way. I gave him the *just a sec finger, as I decided what I wanted to do. Then I was like, ""she was trying to get me to tell you the obvious"". To which after about 1 second he replied ""I like you E"". I just looked at him and had one of those smiles that you can't stop no matter what you do. ""I was like, I was scared you wouldn't get what I meant by that"". He got all scared and was like ""did i get it wrong?"". I just said ""no, no you got it right. I like you."" And it was so cute because after that he said ""I like you too."" A second time. After that he walked me home and on the way he said ""So I like you and you like me, what happens next?"" I told him several times it was up to him. 
A cute little after story was on the way home I was like ""you remember when you sang in front of me then asked me to sing too and I was like 'I don't sing in front of people, you are in drama and are used to it' I don't sing, I rap."" The look on his face was priceless, I think it was one of those oh yea she's hot moments. And continue walking. He was like ""no uh uh, you don't get to just say something like that a walk away. Rap.""  I had been preparing to tell him this and show him so, but I got really scared. And then after me continuing walking he was like ""you can't go home yet, I still have your chair"" I ended up doing it and he was like that's good like really good. I chose the easier one of my two options, but I was like ok now I really want to do the other one. We ended up singing together cause it was River by Eminem and Ed Sheeran. It sounded so cool. And I did pretty good on delivering emotions in that one. Anywho that's all so far besides the fact that we went to his farm/family antique shop today and I met his Grandma, father, and mother. 

Until next time when hopefully I'll tell about our first kiss or atleast and holding. Or maybe me moving away and leaving him. 
P.s he told me through text that if it was alright with me he wanted to date me and that he really liked me, but also that we would deal with the whole moving thing when the time came.",romance

"my best friend starting dating this guy the beginning of last year and i was the one that told her to give him a chance but i’m starting to regret it... before they dated i had texted him before but only about each others posts on snapchat and we actually had a lot in common so i was glad my friend wasn’t going to date someone i hated. the day i met him in person, though. everything changed. i felt so shitty for even having a tiny thought of attraction towards him because my friend is a great person. but as the year carried on, my attraction only grew stronger, and now that they have broken up i find myself thinking of him more often. i try not to and i know i shouldn’t but it’s hard. every day i would find out something else we had in common, and i know it’s dramatic but i really can see myself spending the rest of my life with him. we both have a hole on the top of our ear that only 3% of the world has, we both love stranger things, we have the same favorite foods/seasons/colors, and we both have all the same political view points. we can’t be together without smiling, he always finds a way to make me laugh. probably because his smile is so contagious. we became good friends during their time of dating and i’m glad we still are but i’m afraid me staying friends with him will only ruin my friendship with my best friend and kill my happiness. i feel so horrible for having these feelings but i really feel a connection but i could be imagining it all. thanks for reading all this if you got this far &lt;3",romance

What was the sensation when you first had sex?,romance
"What I write today I do so with great hesitation.  All of what I write is true but if it is ever read, it will be hurtful.  However, I can’t apologize for honesty.  

For the past few weeks, I have been really struggling.  I woke up an old me that used to be me and this old me does not recognize or accept the world we live in.  I can understand, that old me is the real me crying out through 27 years of darkness wanting to live again and living with the moment he gave up and let the darkness take over.  I would give everything short of my soul to get that back, but even at that price, I can not see a way how that would ever be possible.  

There once was a me that was happy but lonely, purely romantic believing the slightest glimpse of hope in a sea of impossibility.  He just wanted love, believed in love, and loved the idea of love.  He had a faith but a more simple one.  He loved Jesus but wasn’t  full of love-killing theology and a church culture where image was everything.  There was a darkness then, but that darkness came from a place he did not know then and it was weak and in the background.  It made me fearful of hurt and hard to trust, but I met someone who saw that and broke through all that.  I found love.

As love is, that love ebbed and flowed at times but I never lost it.  She was my everything and even now that me believes losing her was the worst thing to ever happen in my life.  I can not disagree, that love overwhelmed the dark until the end.  But then something happened, something that tore through the trust I had and hurt me deeply.  At that point I had the choice to face that pain and work through it and make our love stronger than it ever was.  Instead, I opened the door to the dark and that me went to sleep.  I remember that day, in her bedroom, saying one thing while feeling my heart grow cold.  I felt my own death, or so I thought, and was determined to lash out.  This decision, in the end, ruined my life.  I am sure she found the love and happiness she deserves but as for me, I found nothing but cold, hurt, and emptiness and its something I still feel to this day.  

You see, at that moment I changed my life from the course it was supposed to take to where it is now.  I am living a life I was never meant to live.  How else can I explain why I find no joy, no fulfillment, no love, no peace, and living a life of perpetual failures.  Sure I put a lot of lipstick on this pig of a life, but once you scrape past the surface you see whats really there.  What you see is black.  What you see is death.  

Also how can you explain how this once nice loving romantic boy became the selfish heart-consuming monster that he has been.  I did not start off that way, but where I went after I left the first beat whatever humanity was left in my heart into nothing and whatever old the old me was left inside went deep into hiding.  She was evil, and to beat that evil, in the end I became more evil.  When I think about what I have done, all the lies I have told, all the ones I got to fall in love with me for a time just to get me to  the next “real” love, all the others I hurt but drawing some out of relationships all to just get tired of them and break it off slowly until they left me.  I was so good at being what I needed to be that I even forgot that I lost the real me.  

As for those “real” loves? Please.  They were just longer versions of the insignificant ones or ones who ultimately betrayed me and felt my emotional wrath.  I was so good at winning people back even after they left me.  

But no matter how many hearts I stole I could never fill the hole that was inside mine.  I never realized that instead of trying to find the next real love, I needed to be looking at the past to the one I actually had.  The dark would not let me.  I talked about that one so many times, looked at pictures, read notes in yearbooks, and really felt nothing.  

That is why this present situation is so perplexing. Why now after so many years has this suddenly been revealed?  Why open a door and let someone out into a world that is so detached from his reality that  all I can feel is his pain crying out from where he is tucked inside me and  insanely in love for someone not even seen for literally decades?  Is this some tragic hoax just to torture me a little more for the mistakes I made?  Or is it more?  The romantic part of old me wants to believe that it is.  That somehow someone else is feeling the same way and somehow this will all work out and in such a way that causes minimal pain.   Yes, I know the logic of that but remember the old me has a hard time accepting anything as impossible.  

What I do know is that I want to be old me again.  What I also know is that I can not be old me  without any connection to my world today.  What I also know is that I know of one person who can help.  What I also know is that living like I am now in a world I do not belong in as a me that is not real is not sustainable much longer.  I know that for the sake of my own emotional survival this all has to work out.  And therein lies the dilemma.  I do not see a way where  it can.  I am too respectful to even attempt to reach back into someone’s life and I do not know if I can handle it being unwelcome.  I am presently too weak for that.  I used to believe that love looking always finds love looking back.  That old me still does and it is hope that keeps me from completely breaking down each and every day.  How much more can I take of this? I dont know but I dont think its much.",romance

One dark and lonely night
A fair maiden met with I
Dancing and swirling in the dark
She was the apple of any eye

A tragedy my heart did feel
For with her I wanted to be
Dancing and swirling in the dark
Happy and wild and free

So with her I did converse
And learned more of her life
Dancing and swirling in the dark
She did so without any strife

Tonight I rest
With happy tears
Dancing in the dark
Away are all my fears
Swirling in the dark",romance

"I’m sitting in this bar, and it’s raining outside.  There're two cities when it rains outside, and I’m reminded of why I call this place home.  The small little place has uneven floors and mismatched furniture.  It’s not a contrivance though, I just think the old couple that owns it have picked and chosen pieces over the years to replace what once was.  That’s a beautiful way to get through this life.  To pick and choose what fills in the spaces of where things once were but can no longer be.  I’m lost in this thought and the beauty of wet cobbled streets sparkling my New York back at me with a beauty that is pricked with sadness, and at once so full of potential that I barely notice the door open.  First I hear the rain outside as it blends with the din in this place, then I feel the cold, it’s refreshing, and the smell is familiar.  I bristle and snuggle into my own shirt, wishing I had more to put on.  It occurs to me then, the air in here is different this moment than the one before, the weather has brought me something.  My eyes slide to the door and his figure fills my vision, his face falls together first his eyes, then his hair, and finally those lips.  I can smell him.  His black curls drip as he looks up at me through them.  Our eyes meet and all I want is to touch him.  To touch that face that has kept me company all these months, to feel his warmth and draw it into me.  He crosses the entire restaurant in one stride.  I’m on my feet, and as I say his name, my voice catches.  I feel a tremble.   His lips stop me from saying anything else, and as we kiss he holds me. I am still.  He holds me still, withdraws and holding my face in his hands whispers, “I love you.”  It’s like I’d never heard anyone say it before.  It meant everything.  I never needed to hear another word again.  And wonderfully, I knew I’d have my whole life to hear it over and over.  And I finally realized it.  This was it, as the world began to fill back in, and he and I sat and talked and touched and drank.  This was my life.  I would share it happily, and he would do the same.",romance
"I’m 14M and I just got my heart broken for the first time. You may say “you’re too young for love” but I most definitely felt it. It was a feeling I can’t describe... absolute bliss... doesn’t even cover half of it. She was everything I could ever ask for funny, smart, cringey, and also basically the most beautiful girl I ever laid my eyes on. And for some odd reason... she said she loved me back; until today. Today she told me she was wavering since a couple months back and misread our love. Instead of a love that was to be romanticized, she told me that she loved me as a friend. I know it’s not her fault and she didn’t intend to rip me apart. You can’t control your emotions. But I’m torn on what to do. She told me she doesn’t want to lose me as a friend or have me out of her life but it’s so hard for me to decide. I don’t know if I can keep her in my life and move on at the same time and continue just being friends. But I also don’t want to completely remove myself from her life because still; she is one of the best things that had ever happened in my life. Please I need an opinion on what to do. I didn’t know that this could hurt so much",romance
"To begin, I want to ask for advice on what to do with this guy who has a ton of female friends that I have no idea if im different from them. So plz read the story and tell me what it sounds like to you.

I am a mess right now in so many freaking ways. Let's start with meeting the curious charactor.

This past trimester there was a guy in English class who at first I hard core judged for always being late, having airpod things (not air pods but same concept) in nearly all class till he got caught, the way he confused me on whether he was just smart and bored or attention seeking, and lastly the way he DRESSED. He wore the same genre of clothes everyday. From his sleeveless, dark, camo tanks to the boots and jeans. What really confused me was a had one of those rapper boy chains that hang out of your pocket while holding onto your wallet. Who was this guy? Then one day, there was a dreaded group presentation in the form of acting. Me being the tentative girl I am I ended up seeing almost every person in the class forming their groups of 3 in the span of 2 seconds, while I sat there looking for a decent group to join. And guess who was in a group of 2 needing an extra, yep the boy and the girl NO ONE COULD HEAR when she talked. I got forced by the teacher into that group, so I stole the teacher's spinny chair (I had no other chair where they were sitting) and joined them. He was laughing at me the whole class period while I span around in the chair every once in a while. So we chose a scene from what we were studying ( I forgot to mention, it was Romeo and Juliet) and rehearsed it. We giggled together half the time, it was fun. I ended up having a small crush on him to my dismay. 
Break: A cute story 
One day our teacher gave us an assignment on the computers and I had to go charge it in the back of the room. As I recall I answered a question he (the teach) asked, while I was listening to his response to my answer I get this feeling I should look the guy in his eyes and smile cause at that point he was in my view, I listened to it and made quick eyes contact and smiled then looked straight back at the teacher, he smiled back. It was a sweet moment I'm glad I was brave in.
Back to it:
Every once in a while we'd end up standing next to each other in line before the bell, and he would look over at me and ask me a question sorta nervously. Fast forward to the day before finals. We ended up walking to our next class together, I had no clue they were both in the same hall way on the other side of the school previously. The next day was a class discussion where his normal seat got taken cause it was in the middle circle and I sat behind his row. The seat next to me was empty cause that person's group went first. So the guy came over to me after a few seconds of hin just standing ""scanning"" the room for an open seat, and sat down next to me after saying something along the lines of  ""There aren't any other seats open.""  I was thinking I don't care, sit where you want. Anywho, I drew a tic tac board on a peice of paper, marked the middle with an O, and slid it over to him. We played that for awhile till I got bored of winning, and drew a hangman and slid it over to him we played that till it was our groups turn to go in the middle. I got up and walked to the middle, sat down (not on purpose) right next to his usual chair. He follows and sits down in his chair, and he's all like ""I swear I'm not following you this is just my seat."" I was like didn't think you were. So class ends, and we walk together to the next class, except me being the secret blonde (I'm a brunette) I am, forgot that on finals lunch is after that class period. So I was walking with him and asked why everyone was in the cafeteria. As I asked him it dawned on me, and I just had that *face palm moment. I looked back at my usual table and it was FULL people were even standing just to be near it. I told him so, and he invited me to sit with him and his friends. I was like you know what screw it let's make a new friend or two. And sat with his friends (I actually knew 75% of them) so I was like WAHHHHHH. Here is where it gets kinda cute and confusing, he starts introducing all of his friends like how they do in movies where they're like ""that's Chase the idiot, that's Bridget she's depressed as hell"" and shes like 'f*** you' and starts laughing. And it was so cute and polite of him, but also unnecessary. So we just talked and towards the end he was like, ""sooo, do you wanna sit with us tomorrow?"" I was like ~YESSS are you kidding me you guys are so funny and weird like me~ on the inside, but I told him ""I would, but I'm leaving tomorrow."" He was then like ""aw man"" and a couple minutes later I was like should I ask him for his number or snapchat?? And what do ya, he is like ""Do you have snapchat?"" I was like ""Yes"" and obliviously resumed eating. he paused for a sec and was like ""caaan I have it?"" I was like ""Ohh, yea sure!""
The next day I sent him a few pics telling him where we were and when i arrived.
 Every once in a while he'd say hi and sometimes that would turn into a long convo others i got distracted or he had to go. Mid summer he was like we haven't talked in a while, how has your summer been so far? And from then out the talking was at an all time high cause that weekend was our town's yearly summer festival, and he asked if I was gonna be at the parade. I was like, I am IN it. I asked if he was gonna be there and he was like yea. So I was like I'll look out for you and maybe say hi real quick. Ended up missing him, but he saw me (in the best moment where we were doing our super cute dance) i was like, I looked for you but I couldn't see ya. We ended up hanging out there, however, it was our first time hanging out together so we were a little shy and slightly awkward, but eventually we had fun. Another sign that he maybe was into me too, was he kept wanting to buy me something. But that wasn't the only thing, he also did something really sweet that was being really sensitive towards me and my needs, I have a low blood sugar issue and I had just been in the sun walking and cheering for and hour, so I started to get a little dizzy/lightheaded and nauseous. But I didn't tell him he just noticed and was like are you ok? I was so taken aback by this, a guy who I sorta knew could tell when I was attempting to hide not feeling well. (I let him buy some honey for me beforehand cause I could tell he really wanted to, and I didn't want to take advantage of a nice act, so that was a cheap thing) so that was already gonna to help me feel better before I began to feel sick) Skip forward I went on another vacation this one brought some world crashing news (my small world). My father wanted to move us to another state and started looking at homes while we were supposed to be on vacation without asking us beforehand. After that I didn't think it was real(denial), till everything was going so fast that I couldn't ignore what was going on. Things at home are getting super stressful and everyone is being really mean to eachother my parents to each other, my brother and my mother, my brother to me. Its was awful, on top of that we got sick with a flu thing so I told the guy how sick I was and we started talking again. Till this point I didn't want to tell him cause all I wanted to do was keep that friendship normal and not sad. But it got to a point where me telling to my mom about what was going on inside my head was not an option cause I didn't want to give her one more reason to want to give up and leave my dad. So I told him, cause sadly enough, I don't really have many true friends anymore. I decided to give him a chance since he was the person I'd been praying for, the person who WANTED to be around me who TOOK initiative to talk to me, invite me to things, and everything. The previous year, no one (but one person kinda) did that I was crying all the time cause of how lonely it was since I fell out with my middle school best friend. What amazes me was that after I did tell him, he asked me questions about+made sure I was ok not only that be even though i was on the road for leaving the state sometime soon, he STILL wanted to be around me no matter what mood I was in. And previously this week after a little while of silence he said hey and invited me to a thing called music on the green. I couldn't go, but we planned to go to something the next day. But then I realized I'd already seen the movie that was playing several times, so I worked really hard that day and my parents actually let me go hangout with him no conditions (except be home by 8 which I broke woops). So I get to the ice cream place where we decided on meeting at. What was super sweet and ahhh, I got my own ice cream with my coupon and I HATED it. I mentioned that I really didn't like the flavor cherry, and you know what he did??? He freaken got me another even though I refused to let him. We sat on the bench outside for a while and talked. About the move a tiny bit but i tried to keep it off that subject, cause who wants a drag for a friend right? He made the point of ""what type of friend wouldn't want to listen to their friend when that person is going through something?"" Next we were just walking and went past a bed store and he was like, you wanna go in? I was like hmm ... hmmm.. then I was yet again like screw it this'll be a funny story to tell one day. So we went in and that ended up being sooo fun. We walked to walmart and I found my other actual friend the one I mentioned earlier there, so we hung out with her for a little while. She actually knew him too and apparently calls him Tarzan. She had to go with her parents, and I was like that was pretty much my only real friend, and he just got this look on his face and asked then what am I? And I was like well at first you were just a friend but not quite a real one, the you got better? It was really awkward cause I didn't want to friend zone him, but I also didn't want to deny how much his friendship had begun to mean to me. After that we got my bike and I decided to just walk home with him (we live near eachother) it was so nice. I felt the best I'd felt in weeks and laughed harder and more too. At one point we asked the same thing at the same time. That moment was just so hilarious and we found something we had in common from it. When we reached my house he stopped and was like ""so just so we're clear, I was wondering if you wanted to hangout again."" I just couldn't keep a straight face so I smiled and said ""yes""  he then said something about not scaring me off. So ever since then, my minds just been going crazy, wth does he like me or not. Am I just a friend like all his other numerous friends? Or was that a date and he likes me and it's just an unsaid thing. I have a gut feeling that he may, but on the other hand he could just be trying to be kind and polite towards me. 
About half way through writing this, I was thinking ""I'm moving in either a month or over that I just don't know, should i just send this to him explaining everything that has happened from my point of view. And hopefully he'll respond positively. If not then I can move on and just stay his friend if he'll let me."" 

In case I have shown this to you, Michael, you already know by this point but I like you more than just a treasured friend who has helped me more than he knows just by saying hi when he doesn't even know I've just had a rough day. I'm sorry if me showing you this has made you uncomfortable, or anything. If you don't like me back, please just tell me, I'm stronger than you think I can handle rejection it's fine. If you do, it's up to you what happens next. The ball is now in your court man.",romance
"Hi everyone so instead of focusing on a relationship in high school I instead focused on building a business that makes 60k in passive income a year and will hopefully make 100k a year next year. That is great in all but I traded the opportunity during my senior year to date a beautiful girl because I was to focused on building my business. It has made me super depressed knowing I could have done both. I am wondering how I can make up for the time I missed out on? I missed out on the dances, going to the games with her, talking about high school drama, and etc. Btw both of us are going to community college next year and I have a strong feeling she will end her relationship with her sophomore boyfriend. But even if they don’t end their relationship I am still wondering how to make up for this with someone else?",romance
"Hi guys. So I’ve been with my girl for a few weeks now and I am head over heels. She is funny, she’s smart, she’s ,understand, she’s gorgeous and as you can tell by now I could go on forever. 

She is also very reserved, to the point that we had not had our first kiss up until last night and it was terrible.

Not for the reasons you might think.

I’ve been thinking about it for a while and I even had a dream about our first kiss and it was perfect in that dream. But I always struggle with these things because I have a crippling fear of rejection so I always end up never making a move. This time I decided to go for it and it turned out exactly how I have always feared it would. I came in for the kiss and she said “no”.

We were snuggling when this happened and I thought there’d be no way for it to go wrong but she completely lost it and shoved me away then stormed out. I have no clue what happened so I don’t even know what to say to her. At this point I’m just going through a whole lot of things in my head and I’m deciding whether to just let her be. 

Advice?",romance
"There’s this girl that I can’t even begin to express the love that I have for her. We hang out almost every day and I’ve told her how I truly felt about her in the past yet she responded by saying she thought of me only as a great friend. Then a couple months later we ended up getting really really close and even had a couple flings here and there, but we’ve gotten over it now and returned to normal friend status. Although occasionally we’ll hold hands, make eye contact, flirt, and just know what each other are thinking. She’s a singer/songwriter and sure to be famous and make an impact on the world from it someday. However, she has one more month left in the States because she’ll be moving to England for 7 months in September. I want to tell her how I truly feel once again. But also don’t want to distract her focus from her preparation for England. What do I do?",romance
"I’ve been friends with my best friend for six years. We’ve always just been platonic friends, and, because we even sort of look similar, have even joked about being siblings and pretended to be at parties. I’ve been her wingman, she’s been my wing woman, we talk about our romances, we’ve seen each other through different relationships, good ones and bad ones. We fought a while back and stopped talking for a while, then reconciled. 

I’ve been excited and happy to have her back in my life, and we spend a lot of time hanging out and talking about our days, watching shows, doing puzzles, smoking. A few weeks ago, I invited her on a trip for my birthday. It was a great time, we got an Airbnb, and on our last night there, we slept together. 

It was our first time ever being intimate, and it was great and exciting. We were both into it, but, knowing we might put our friendship at risk, we decided to not mention it, move past it, and go on with our lives. Things are back to normal, and we haven’t talked about it at all. But I feel like things have changed; I see her just a little differently and now I wonder about what it would be like to have someone who knows me so well and who I know so well be more than just my friend. 

It seems like it’d be perfect, and I like the way I get nervous when I think about talking to her about it all. But I don’t know if I should just nip my feelings in the bud and move on, or bring this up and see what she has to say about it. What do I do?",romance
"I’ve been with my girlfriend for a few weeks now and we’ve only been on one date. We both hate texting and we are both super cool when we’re together because we understand we suck at texting and we are super busy.

But the thing is that I have thought of a million different things to do with her but I’m literally broke and can’t afford to take her on another date. This makes me want to spend less time with her because I don’t feel like a good boyfriend. 

I also don’t want to lose her because she is very special to me. But sometimes I think of breaking it off because I think she deserves better than this. I need help, desperately.",romance
"Hello, as you can see in the title i am in middle school. I am 13 years old, not very attractive yet rarely people will say people have crushes on me or something but in my school it is normally a prank or something like that. Now i am 5’7 so i seem like a pretty big stick. Though i just recently started working out so that i build some muscle. Now if i like a girl i am very bad at dating and do not really know how to express my feelings. Though i once dated someone but they said i was immature which i was, since it was a year ago. That person says i matured but i really dont think i did. Is there a way that i can be more of a mature gentlemen to girls? Also i know this is a strange question but, at my age group people get acne, plus for me it is hereditary. Is there a fast way to clear it because it is a very big letdown when people look at me. I have tried a face wash which does not really help. Hope i can get some answers for these pretty strange questions.",romance
"First, how we met... In 2017 I met a girl (Let's call her ""C"") on a trip to PEI, the smallest province in Canada. Our mothers were friends for 31 years leading up to that. We hit it off immediately and started to discuss things like gaming and stuff. We stayed up late every night for bonfires and I burned lots of marshmallows. A few days in, I took her home and we smashed (we all went to my place and we played Super Smash Bros haha gotem). When she left to go to her home across the country, I gave her a little hug and said goodbye after we exchanged contact information.

We kept in touch, sort of.

I developed feelings for her a year later.

Fast forward to 2019, two days after school ended.

The lead up... At this point I'm in her home city four time zones away. She takes me out for a walk and we go to a gas station / convenience store named after a certain obscure geometric shape that looks a bit like an arrow. For the first time in my life, I buy a certain popular sugary cold drink that almost gives me brain freeze. Blue flavour, of course. So we're walking back through the neighbourhood and I joke about our ""very romantic date"" on the way. We get home and park ourselves at the dining room table and continue being awkward.

The revelation... I tell her there's something I want to do at midnight. I remind her that the month will end (It's June 30) and I want to do something special that I've never done before. She asks ""What,"" and I lift my right arm and wrap it around her shoulders, leaning into her saying ""This is a hint."" She turns and gives me a peck from the right side and tells me ""You're sweet,"" and I'm in shock. I couldn't believe this was really happening. I reveal to her that I felt this way for about a year at this point. She tells me she had an interest for some months. Now I tell her I want to kiss her a second before the month ends, so the kiss lasts from June to July.

The plan... I tell her I'll try to stay up. I live in a time zone 4 hours ahead, and I flew in early so I was awake since 5 AM, which was the equivalent to 1 AM where we were. The goal was to stay up until at least midnight, 23 hours no sleep. That didn't work. I spent the whole day with her until I couldn't think on my own from the fatigue. I ended up telling her to wake me up at 11:45 PM, and I dozed off in the living room. I woke up in darkness to see her standing next to me. It was sensational, seeing her so committed, standing over me while I was on the ground. It was time.

The juicy part... She takes me into her room trying not to wake our parents (by the way we aren't related and we have different parents), and I stop to take out my retainer and brush my teeth because I want this experience to be perfect. Then I strut back in to her isolated space. She encourages me to lie down next to her on the little bed. She wraps her arms around my body and strokes my hair as I do the same to her. I could tell from her tone of voice and her movements, she was really enjoying this. Is it 11:59 yet? Almost. She sees her phone clock hit 11:57. I count 60 seconds in my head and whisper a few of them. 11:58. I refined my timing and counted another minute accurately. 11:59, and I can't contain my excitement. I whisper ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5,"" and I was shaking inside. We make eye contact every so often and it's beautiful. I see her face and she looks as if she wants to kiss me now. ""40, 41, 42,"" I whisper, and she says ""Let's just do it now!"" I stop her for a few seconds, then realize I can probably hold a kiss that long. So we do it. I pull her towards me, and she reaches around and squeezes my body. I can say there and then, there was no space between our open mouths.

The aftermath... The parents walked in and beat me with a cane, just kidding. We stayed there together, in awe of what we just did. ""We did it,"" was all I could muster. I tensed up. ""Is this real? Is this actually happening? Pinch me,"" I say. She pinched my bicep. It hurt. It was real. It actually happened. In a few minutes of shock, I accepted that the best possible thing to happen actually happened. We kissed again and again. She continued to caress me, then she fell asleep in my arms. I stayed there, laying awake for hours. I couldn't sleep as long as we were in physical contact, but I didn't mind. I stayed there until I really needed to go back to bed, and I woke her to say I was going back, and kissed her one more time before resting and continuing our romantic adventure.

I love you, C. -R",romance

My mom brought something up the other day. She thinks that me and H are one of the few people in this world with no sex drive. And my perverted ass just agrees even though I know thats not true. At least for me. So here's the issue: What if my mom is right about H? 

And none of y'all best be tellin me to just ask him. I couldn't even tell H I wanted to kiss him without almost having a panic attack! (he figured it out himself bless) I guess all I can do is watch his actions when we're close or something. In the past when we'd be layin on the couch cuddling, I noticed nothing from him. While me, on the other hand, will melt if he even brushes his hand against my lower side or something. (Apparently I'm good at hiding it. My inability to blush helps lol)

"Hi everyone I think something is mentally wrong with me to start. Let me tell you what I believe is causing my depression. I have posted here before and here is what I said:

“I feel as if I wasted the best years of my life doing something so dumb I can't stand life anymore. Last summer my group of friends started hanging out with this group of girls and one of them was interested in dating me. I decided not to date her because I was to busy with my business and saw that she was dating a new guy every month and I didn't just want to be just another guy. (BTW she was dating a lot for emotional reasons and not sex)

When I was a kid I was very lonely and didn't have many friends. I was bullied for how I acted and how I looked. I was always pushed around in life and never had the confidence to do anything. When I got into high school I decided to take a stand to this bullshit and started building a business. I worked so hard to build my business and was so obsessed that when something wouldn't go right I would want to end my own life. Now at the end of my senior year my business makes about 60k a year in passive income and I will probably make 100k a year passively in the next couple of years. This would sound great to the old me and to many others but honestly I feel fucking stupid.

Since freshman year I dreamed that senior year would be amazing. I would have a beautiful girlfriend and I could take her to homecoming and prom and have the kind of relationship I would see in the movies. My dream was so big but I felt my hard work could make something like this come true. Well honestly it did and thats what the problem is. The girl that I decided to pass up over the summer started dating a guy that she continued dating all school year up until today. Throughout the school year I had to watch them have the kind of senior year I have always wanted. Now that high school is over I feel like a huge failure. I chased money when I had the perfect girl in front of me the whole time who didn't care about my money or looks and liked me for me. Something much better than anything I could have dreamed of. Sadly I had to watch this die in front of my eyes. I can't believe how stupid I am. I wake up every morning in utter regret for what I have done. Each day gets worse as I think about what could have been to the point where I don't want to live anymore.”

I realized that my depression doesn’t have much to do with her. It was the dream I had that I can now never fulfill. I can never take a girl I like to a dance with my friends and have a great time. I can’t go to those games with a girl I care about. In fact I can’t do anything now because it’s over. I feel as if I never had the time I wanted to in high school and I feel as if I failed. I can’t move on because I have this need to finish what I started and the fact that this dream is dead I feel as if I have died with it. It’s all that mattered to me and now I have nothing besides 4 years of regret. To anyone who comments I know this may sound pointless to you but this was the dream I created and the dream I spent countless hours trying to achieve. All my struggles and successes are in that dream. Hopefully you can understand that if you worked as hard as I did and when you reached the moment when all your hard work was about to pay off you missed your chance and all you had to do was just was just say tell someone you like them and the dream would have been complete. I understand that yes she could have broken my heart but at least I would have got some kind of reward but instead I leave empty handed. The money that I earned means nothing without the dream. Maybe I am crazy for being so depressed and suicidal for not completing what I wanted but please give your honest opinion. Every comment is truly appreciated.",romance
"In the gay community there's an extreme amount of emphasis on sex and hookup culture, but on the flip side, there's so much media that focuses on a romantic relationship. 
I'm not an exception, my friends would tell you I'm the ""slutty"" one, always looking for someone to hook up with and never speak to again. At most after a few weeks I get bored and break things off.
Lately though, I find myself longing for the romance I see in movies and other media but find myself unable to commit to it when the opportunity presents itself.

my dad went. there, i met two guys, we'll call them B1 and B2. so they were both older than me by a year bc i was the youngest camper there. i ended up talking to B1 about memes here on reddit (specifically cursed comments) a lot during meals and we had the same friend group through the week. if im being honest, i had a slight crush on him but nothing real. he was very souless though. i only became friends with B2 a few days before camp ended and he kind of annoyingly followed me around, to the point where i would make an effort to avoid him in a way. however, he was still really nice and respectful. but i also got really close with one girl right before the week ended. we'll call her M. she was on the same swim team as B1 and B2 as it was a large team very close by. she also happened to have a huge crush on B1. she was the one to tell me that she thought B1 had a crush on me. i have never really been someones crush before, so this was a shock to me. later thet night, while all the girls were hanging out in the dorms, i was talking about how annoying B2 could be when they said he probably liked me. this again was a shock. keep in mind that i live 13 hrs from the both of them. i got B1's snapchat and we dont really talk, besides the occasional meme. however, M doesnt know about my slight past crush and we are still close. i have a crush here at home too, which only the girls at camp knew much about. i still like him a lot, but now im distracted by the other boys. camp was only 3 weeks ago.",romance
"To: You , something I should’ve told you a long time ago. 






Letting go is hard. Letting go of someone is hard. Letting go of someone you cherished is even harder. Letting go of someone you knew didn’t cherish you enough is unbearable. I know people go through this stuff all the time, but I never thought I’d be one of them. 
Getting so lost in fun, you lose yourself. I never thought I’d lose myself trying to find someone else. I never thought I’d wanna find someone. I never thought I’d wanna find a reason to be with someone. I never thought I’d do these things for you. 
You made me see things in a whole new perspective. You made me feel things in a new perspective. You made me. 
Losing you will hurt, losing apart of me will hurt more. Intertwined on this weird patch of our lives, you were a nobody to me but suddenly became the only person to me. 
How do you care about someone this much? Because you grow with them. 
 I’ve never found a reason to write before, I’ve never found a reason to tell anyone before but you are that someone to change me. But I wasn’t that person to change you. 

I don’t deserve the sleepless nights, I don’t deserve the crying, I don’t deserve the wondering. When you don’t even know why I do these things. 
But hey,
Maybe this is hopeless? Maybe I dug too deep into my own grave? Maybe I was another fuck and run? Maybe we’ll never know? 
I spent so many days scared, but I never thought to myself why I would be scared? 
I’m sorry I was scared and I never told you how I truly felt about you all this time. I don’t think I needed to, when you always knew deep down. I think you were afraid too. 
Endless amounts of sleep LOST trying to figure out math and graphs. ELIMINATING my own work to figure out the answers for you. 
That stuck to me the most, because that’s what I was really doing. Cancelling everything out to figure out something for you. 
I never really cared about myself that much because it’s weird it’s not who I am but once I saw you and how your life was. I started to see myself differently and care about myself differently. I’m glad you did come into my life. I just wish we did everything backwards. But then again when do we ever follow the RULES.

- I wrote this to finally not combust into a thousand pieces of how I felt, to finally let you know. I don’t know if you actually get to read this haha maybe I’ll write it out since it’s more sincere that way. Anyways. To the person who made me slightly different, who made me finally release myself. It’s 3:33pm scary. Feelings are scarier. Maybe you’ll get my letter when you’re already in A—- but I’m not too sure yet.. I don’t know why I keep avoiding to say this but I do love you. I kept trying to brush off my feelings but I don’t think it’s possible. You know I care about you so much. Sex, I could care less about my own pleasure. I got so much pleasure from being with you and getting to know you and your lovely family. I know how much you’ve done for you and your family which amazes me, I know you’re only doing what’s best but it feels so heartbreaking to know I wasn’t apart of that plan this time. I know you aren’t the perfect person but I know deep down you are somewhat something more than perfect. You are D——. Office Depot D——. My goose D—-. D—. Why did mama G—- give you such a name jeez. I don’t know why you’re different now. Why you suddenly just made me disappear, but I’m sorry for whatever I’ve ever done to you. I promise you meant more to me than anybody else has. I’m sorry for all the times I’ve cause stressed. There’s so much more to be sorry about but it’d take forever. You know I’m actually a mess. I wish I could’ve talked to you that day in the car and told you what I’ve been dying to tell you but I think I’d have a panic attack. I know I’ve never been the only one, but you should know to me you’ve been the only person I’ve wanted. I had you, I lost you. You’ll lose me too.",romance
"Why do I cringe when someone is being sweet to me? I am a straight female and I've already dated a few people in the past but everytime they hug me, tells me sweet things, or even kisses me (well they try to), it always makes me cringe.

"So I met this girl 6 years ago on a school trip and honestly that’s where it starts. We will just call her “C”. When we were getting our luggage from the airport, my friend had asked me to go with him and talk to this girl he was interested in. At the time I didn’t have any interest in anyone and didn’t have anything better to do so we went over to go see her. Standing next to the girl he was talking about was the girl I haven’t been able to get out of my head for the past 6 years. We went up to them and I introduced myself, then something kind of amazing happened. They looked at each other surprised then looked at her bag and on her bag was a sticker with my name on it. To this day I still think of that as a sign and I always wonder if she does too. Anyway so that’s how we met and we became friends after that but I wanted to be more than that. Throughout the first year of knowing her, we got extremely close. We bonded through her cute “man” voice when she had lost her voice and the movie camp rock. One song in particular actually, from camp rock 2, Introducing me by nick jonas. I promised her that I would learn that song on guitar and sing it to her. So I spent countless nights singing that song and trying to figure it all out and I would send her little parts of the song just so she knew I was trying. I don’t think she ever fully grasped how hard I was trying though..yikes. Anyway, at the end of the first year I told her how I felt and everything and she said she wasn’t ready for a relationship which was understandable because we were young so I just decided I’d wait for her. We stayed friends and the second year nothing too exciting happens. But then high school started and I had lost hope that she would ever really like me back so I started dating for the first two years of high school. Those relationships didn’t really work out even though I gave them everything I could I think when problems started to happen I didn’t try to fix them because I was hoping it wouldn’t work. I still wanted “C”. So junior year comes around and I start really talking to her again and we have a thing for a little bit. During which I held her in my arms while we were on my couch and normally it’s whatever but with her it felt right in its own way. Ps I am not a hugger usually because I find it hard to be emotionally available to people. So holding someone that wasn’t a family member or girlfriend is a big thing for me. Also in this same year, summer before junior year of high school, we made bracelets. Well, at least she helped me make my bracelet because I’m not very good at it. In any case, I told her I was never going to take it off unless it breaks. Fast forward a summer, I still have the bracelet and I have some of my friends over who are trying to take a pillow from me (Two of my close friends that are female). They can’t do it but one of them clips my bracket and breaks it. This actually like gave me a pain in my stomach and I got very upset for the day but I didn’t want to make my friends feel bad so I just tired it to my backpack and told “C” that we needed to make a new one. So we meet make a new one and then something happens that nobody thought would. The friend group that had stood the test of time, started drifting apart. We all had jobs that started getting in our way and new friend groups. So now senior year starts and I’m still talking to “C” and I’m still head over heels for this girl but she doesn’t know the extent of what I feel. After I told her how I felt, we started talking more again until I found out my best friend since preschool liked her too. This was a crushing moment but we agreed we should all just be friends. He has a very short attention span and really is just looking for anyone who will give him attention so she wasn’t anything special to him and he moved on from that moment. For me though, this was different and I still haven’t moved on. Now it’s the summer after senior year, I haven’t talked to her since school so I decided to text her. I sent her a picture of the bracelet and told her this one was getting pretty tight on me and I might need a new one. I get a text back and we start talking. I ask her what’s up and how’s everything going, only to find out she has a boyfriend who isn’t going to the same college as she is and they’ll be in different states completely. I don’t know if they plan on staying together or what and I haven’t met him so I don’t know what their relationship is like. I still have butterflies when she says my name or I see her name show up on my phone and I have never once seen anything negative about her. I leave in two weeks and I almost don’t want to see her before I leave because that’s the hardest goodbye I’ll have to give. I don’t know if I’ll tell her that I still feel this way or not because I don’t think she has even thought about me as anything more than a friend in a while. Sorry for the book, I needed to express myself a little.",romance
"I’m 26, male. She’s 23.

We are going to spend a few days in a cottage that is secluded, in about 3 days. This year has challenged us a bit, and we haven't had any private time away from the house in over a year and a half, possibly even two years. We have had ups and downs when it comes to being intimate.

Inside the cabin is a large jacuzzi tub, large shower that is also heated.

Outside is a gazebo and fire pit.

We are looking for romantic ideas while we spend time alone there.

The plan so far: Hoping for great weather to be outside (the entire time preferably) to lounge around, lay out, read books, etc. I plan on being nude, she feels more comfortable in a swimsuit/lingerie.

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!",romance

"wanted to share this for so long but now i think it's time: 
There's this girl that I like who's now basically my bestfriend/soulmate (I'm 17 and she's 15) since we're so similar in most of our taste and basically almost every aspect of our lives that's why we got close. Anyways I have a huge crush on her for a few months now. We would talk to each other all day and all night, have video calls (tho im the one who initiates the convos and video calls on messenger usually) but all's good. A few weeks ago we watched Far From Home and it was basically out first date where it's actually our first time to meet up  (let me note that we have no label and aren't in a romantic relationship)  so it was awkward as fuck at first but eventually the tension disappeared then throughout the movie we chatted a lot and she keeps on clinging to me on the ""extreme and emotional parts"" where she'd just lean on my shoulder and grab my shirt and hit me. It continued for a while until the movie ended. Then we went to the arcade to play and lots of playful teasing and weird convos involved. Roamed the mall for the entire afternoon before going home. We have couple of nicknames for each other btw. But aren't all close friends like this? I really don't want to keep my hopes up. She would constantly nag me to not do stupid shit and all. She's been there for me emotionally. We always shower each other with support and encouragement. 


So that's it. Idk if it's just purely platonic or something more. Let me note that im a butch lesbian (could easily pass off as a guy lmao) and she's bi. Im really confused im not used to this kind of shit you know? Im a shy, awkward type of gay. What do you guys think? Should I elaborate even more? I'm in my awkward, confused teenager phase rn so I could definitely use some help.

I want to win her over. But the only thing that makes me hesitate to go all the way is the fact that we're now relatives after my uncle remarried another woman who happens to be her aunt. We're now basically a family, I guess? But this one's another issue tho. We both love to flirt (?) around and talk. 


We plan to have another date next month (where we'll watch a movie and eat at a korean resto)

I just want to know if I have a chance with her and that if she also feels the same way. I really need some guidance and advice from you older folks here :(",romance
"I liked her, a lot actually. I never thought some shit like this would happen. I miss her. God, why do you let things like this happen, some disgusting shit like this. I have no idea if you even exist or if the devil is running the damn forsaken world. whoever it is I’ll never forgive you for taking her away from me. You take her away from me and I can’t take shit from you, damn you disgusting prick. I don’t care who you are who gives you to permission to mess with our lives and why can’t we mess with yours fucking asshole. Just let me see her... just let me see her one last time... let me say bye... let me see her, why do you have to do this I have never done anything to you. Why do you do this, things like this disgust me. Let me see her again... I don’t care if it’s just for a second. I’ll treasure that second, I’ll make it feel like years. Even if I have to give my life for that second. Let’s me see her just one more time.... just let me see... I want to see her, I want to see her I know what she looks like inch by inch I’ll know if you show me a fake. If you do I’ll make sure you fucking suffer. Let me see her... her pale skin was so smooth and soft. Her hair blonde silky I remember when I would run my fingers through her hair it would sometimes be knotted. Let me see her... her beautiful eyes, blue filled with life and reflected like a shine through a diamond. Let me see her... her voice even when it she was sick and her voice was raspy she sounded beautiful I want to hear her again I miss her voice. Let me see her... her personality... her personality was one of the most innocent things to exist on the earth. The earth didn’t deserve an angel like her... I didn’t deserve and angel like her especially... BUT DAMN IT YOU CANT GIVE ME SOMETHING AND TAKE IT AWAY. Let me see her... again... let me see her... let me see her... let me see her... let me see her... let me see her.... let me see her... I miss her... let me see her... give her back... let me see her... I know I don’t deserve her... but you don’t either... but just... give her back... let me see her... let me see her.... let me see her... let me see her... let me see her... let me see her... let me see her...

"So, a couple of you have commented and messaged me about me last post on ""not over him"". I'd like to give more clarification and explain it all in this post so I don't have to miss out on detail if I had replied back individually.

I met this stud of a dude when I was six at church. At this age, love isn't something you think of. We grew close because his sister and I were friends so I'd always go over to their house over summer or break. Most of you may think that he wouldn't come hang with us but he actually did. We watched movies together and talked a bit when his sister left the room. This went on for a couple of years but I still had no feelings for him. 

Then one day, his friends tell me that he likes me and I'm confused and flattered by it all. I didn't care too much about it at the time but things just got awkward because everyone would continuously tease us (btw this was when I was like 12 or 13). We kinda stopped talking which kinda made me sad. I'm not sure exactly when I started having a crush on him but I think it was when he kind of moved on from having a crush on me.

When it was time for us to pick what colleges we'd attend, we started talking more. During this time, he'd leave me on read or won't open my messages but would reply on a group chat that we were both on. Not to be over dramatic, but it just felt uncomfortable because I'd reply to his messages at least within the hour or so.  In the end, we ended up choosing the same college.",romance
"I've been on vacation for the past month and during that time I hadn't really thought of him. None. Nada. Zeilch. I come back and he's left for vacation. I still didn't care. Out of nowhere, I started to miss him. My feelings for him increased. I wanted to see him desperately even though I can't. I began to have dreams of him. One included him and I making out on the lawn. How I desperatly miss him yet he doesn't care for me back. That's the thing with having crushes. Only you care. I see him in a week and I'm already imagining touching him in places I could only dream of. It makes me feel all types of ways just thinking about it. Then I snap back to reality. He doesn't give a single fuck about me so why should I devote myself to him?",romance

"It was the last lecture for this semester, after that the exams would follow up in a quick tempo. Jim was worried that he might not be able to learn all the necessary topics in time and had to postpone the exams once again.

He was not in a very good mood, he focused on one of the empty seats in the middle of the lecture room. ""Excuse me, may I go through?"" he asked one of the anonymous students. The student stood up and said ""of course"", a quick quite ""thank you"" hushed through Jim's lips as he passed by.

He sat down and put in his earphones to relax his mind and build up focus for the last lecture. Jim was a single 23 year old guy, struggling with his studies although this was one his favorite science fields. The mathematics behind the methods were just too difficult for him to comprehend, he wanted to know everything and knowing the little time they were given to prepare for exams it saddened him that he had to just focus on passing the exams instead of actually learning. At least that is what he thought and believed.

Right before the lecture started, a girl tapped on Jim's shoulders and asked ""Is this seat empty?"", Jim surprised by the fact that a girl was talking to him tried to keep his posture and said with a calm but stuttery voice ""yes, it is free."". She sat down next to him. Jim noticed her sweet parfume. ""That smell. It seems to be in nowadays"" he thought to himself. The lecture began and both went on carefully listening to the lecturer, hoping to catch even the slightest hints for the upcoming exam. They helped each other when they didn't hear or couldn't read something occasionally.

Jim felt almost sad that the lecture ended. He knew this wasn't considered as spending time with someone, but her sitting next to him somehow made Jim feel more comfortable yet also nervous at the same time, anxious for making a wrong move. Anyways, he never knew how to approach girls so just as always he thought about focusing on getting home as quickly as possible to study.

Jim's mind was convoluted with all sorts of different thoughts, just as usual. ""Talk to her"" said the one voice, the other countered ""No, you will harass and annoy her. Even if you talk, what are you going to talk about, huh?"". Jim was torn in between his thoughts.

Ann, the girl who sat next to Jim during this lecture had also mixed thoughts. ""Talk to him."" said one voice, the other voice countered as well ""No, what if he doesn't like you? Surely he is taken and don't want to hang around with you. Besides, you are not even wearing anything exciting or have make up on. He will find you ugly!""

Jim and Ann were both fighting with their inner-selves while waiting for the other students to get up and make room for them to leave.

Although the students took more time than usual to free up the way, it went too quick from Jim's point of view. As he reached the entrance and was about to go home he turned around one last time to see what Ann is up to. He saw her going her way but she was moving slowly. He sighed and went on his way. 

Ann was about go home too but she was still unsure to talk to Jim. She finally had the thought to ask him to study together. Unsure if she will have the confidence to actually ask him she sti turned around and but saw Jim leaving. She sighed and went home as well.",romance
"M is a 16 year old that has ALOT of problems with family, life and friends, here is her background.
M was 15 when her little brother John was killed by a killer called David but that wasn't it her dad was in on it and her mother knew about it but didn't do a single shit, because M was an amazing student she became bf with the supervisor that is soon to be principal to the point where she told her everything and one day she said ""I know this is Wierd but my mother is a psycho she knew about the killer who killed John and didn't  do anything and I can't prove it, I need serious help!"" the supervisor thought and said ""I will adopt u"" M looked at her in shock and said ""will u?"" and the supervisor responded with ""of course"".
A couple weeks later and M was adopted and she started to sleep in the dorms in which she never slept there cause her mother would never allow it, M started to learn self defense privately in the school on holidays to the point where the principal gave her a think l gun and told her ""I need to protect students and the school and of course keep it a secret"" M was really happy and agreed at once.
M was always bullied since her brother died cause since then she was down and alot people called her ""lame"" M was bothered but showed no attention. After a while she started being more cheerful so 5 new boys came to school the principal told the students about them and they were greeted she was searching for M so she can give one of them a tour around the school's property then M came rushing, the supervisor called her and she said "" I have to go"" she was so fast that the new kids couldn't see her face all they saw was a running girl.
At night the students would sit in the lounge, after a while someone came and said ""who would like to help in designing the gym for the party"" M was the first to join then the new kid asked ""is that the girl that ran?"" and one of the other students said ""yes"".
When the students were finishing up Caleb (M's bully) came up to her and said ""WOW u are here after ur brother died"" *throws the jug of fruit punch* all of the students were shocked but they still laughed, M didn't want to fight with them because the principal said so, M decided to leave without a word.
The party started and they were going to close the doors when M came in hot 😉 walking to her friends at the bar Caleb came and said ""oh hey.... U lookin good today"" gave her a drink she took it, said thank u, threw the drink in his face then she went to her friends (Lia, Mia, dede) , everyone turned from hating M to crushin on her. 
The party was over but the fun wasn't, there was an after party at lia's house.
M went and got the car while the girls were getting their things, M kept waiting and honking but they didn't come out, when they did dede tripped but Richard (one of the new kids) held her before she fell, M saw her and ran out of the car to help her and told the other girls to get her things and she will take her to the car, M said ""thx"" and left. 
They went to the after party and M found some people suspicious she followed them then she knew what gang they were in the middle of the party she shot 2 of them then a 3rd came and pushed her to the floor and she pushed him ran and shit him then she trapped the 4th one and asked him ""what is the gang's location?"" he told her the name of the store and the alleyway, she started walking and he said ""u won't let me go?"" she turned around and said ""no b***h"". *shoots him in the head*When she was leaving she found out that the door was locked and windows as well, then a guy came and guess what it was David when she saw she got her gun out then all of his men showed up and he said ""still wanna shoot me and kill all these people?"" she puts her gun down ""look I mean no harm, all I want is to finish unfinished business"" M was confused and said ""what business?"" he looks at her, laughs and said ""the day your brother died was a mistake he wasn't suppose to die it was u who was gonna die but you sent your brother to get the mop instead of u so technically u did it...... YOU KILLED HIM"" M stood still just shocked while he said ""I will give u the choice, either u shoot yourself or I shoot the others"" M took the gun, pointed it on her head and seconds before she pulls the trigger her mother came, took the gun pointed it at herself and that moment the trigger was pulled and her mother's gang barged in and shot David and his gang but David wasn't  dead yet,(he was shot in his shoulder) then Lia's mother passed in front of M and said ""stay away from my daughter"" and followed her Dede, Mia and thier moms, M looked at them while she was in pain then she suddenly reached out for the gun, ran to David while he was in pain on the floor and shot him 6 times while crying until Jones came and held her from her back in which her hands were held tight, pulled her back, and on the floor they fell, then Jones's friends Isra and Roni CAME (they are from her mother's gang but will start to go to the same school as M) , isra was sitting on the opposite side of Jones while Roni was in M's face calming her down, but no matter what, whatever happened in this room cannot be undone. 
M wasnt suppose to go to school for a couple of months after what happened, but after only a month M came into a school like she owns it, I can say that everyones' Jaws dropped (she started wearing a black leather jacket, tight black leggings and high heels) M walked in theiddlw of the hall stoped and looked at Lia, Mia and Dede and completed like a strong woman then she reached her friends Jones, Isra and Roni and all of them went to the lounge because that day was holiday.
After Caleb saw M fighting and shooting u think he would stop but he went further, he entered the lounge with his friends and said ""M girl we missed u, I actually didn't 😂😂 what was your feeling knowing that u killed your brother"" M got up and stood right in face and said ""I CAN EXPOSE YOU"" Caleb looked at her and said ""ha u got something on me"" M replied ""If u forgot let me remind u"" and she gave him the dirtiest look u will ever see, at that moment the supervisor barged in and said ""WHAT IS HAPPENING?"" no one talked then Caleb said ""M is blackmailing me"" M said ""am I?"", ""YOU ARE!"" said Caleb, the supervisor stoped them and said ""both of u will say what happened but let us start with M"" M says ""He came up to me making fun of my brother then got up the thing that I am the reason for his death *she looks at Caleb and completes saying* I did nothing and why do u have to always make me the bad guy everyday every minute ever second, JUST STOP, I AM NOT THE BAD GUY IF THERE IS A BAD GUY HERE THEN IT IS U CALEB, U ARE THE ONE WHO STALKED ME AND BLACKMAILED ME WITH THE PICTURES U TOOK OF ME IN MY OWN HOUSE, U STALKED ME AND I HAVE THE FOOTAGE OF U OUTSIDE OF MY HOUSE, u thought I deleted them ha I didn't, I am not that stupid"" The whole school was speechless and the supervisor said ""to my office Caleb!"" M ran out of the lounge and the new kid ran behind her, he screamed ""M"" she looked behind her and he said ""I am..."" she completed ""Alex, I know everyones' names"" he put his hand on her shoulder and said ""don't listen to anything he said"" M started crying and mumbling ""I killed him.... I killed my brother😭"" he hugged her and said ""u didn't"" over and over again.
The next day of school no one saw M nor Alex since"" the hug"", the school finished exams early and had 4 months left, the supervisor allowed the students to not have lessons but must stay on school property until they get permission from the ministry, a month past and they got the permission so the principal gathered all the students in the assembly field and said ""we got the permission for u to leave but what u don't know is your activity scores weren't entered so let's enter them, shall we?..."" the supervisor completed ""we shall, u will go to apartments that we rented for u and u will get to share a room with someone from this...",romance

"This past Sunday I went to see Spider-Man: Far From Home, it was awesome. After the movie I went through the mall and met up with a friend at her job. We hung out and I went to get us food while she worked. After getting her something I went to a churro stand and there was this gorgeous cashier girl. She was tall, brown skinned, had black hair and squishy cheeks (face cheeks so don't think about it). She had no make-up on so I saw how naturally pretty she was and man I can't stop thinking about her. I didn't ask for her name or number because she had people to attend to. I asked my friend if she knew her but she didn't know anything and barely sees her. 

I admit I have a crush on her. I want to find out more about her and see if I have a chance with her. Now how can I grab her attention and talk with her? I don't go to the mall all too often so just going there out of the blue just to see her would be really creepy. My best chance right now is to find her on social media and ask friends if they know her. If this doesn't work then does anyone here have an idea on what I should do?",romance

"So basically, I’m a gay guy(not sure if there’s a better sub for this) and while on a school trip I told my best friend I was gay, and he asked if I liked him, so to save from embarrassment I said no.  I DO.  I’ve 100% fallen for him but if I try to be subtle, he’ll think I’m jus nice because of my statement.  But I don’t want to tell him I actually do.  I guess this sounds trivial to you guys when I say that I’m 14.

"I've been talking to this girl for about a month maybe a little more and last night we confessed deep feelings for each other. The next time we go on a date, I want to ask her if we can put a boyfriend/girlfriend label on our relationship. I was wondering what would be the best present to go along with the proposal. Any ideas please?",romance
"So I started working with this new girl about 3 weeks ago. We get along really well, like two peas in a pod. I gave her my number about a week in and we have been texting and snap chatting every day since then. We have called and FaceTimed each other multiple times for hours on end. 

Now, I have not been in a relationship, or even a date for that matter for years. YEARS. Mainly because I just wasn’t interested in dating or finding a potential partner, but now that I’ve met this girl my idiot self is falling for her HARD. Like I can’t get her out of my head, every waking minute is spent thinking of her. 

Ok, also she has claimed me as her “best friend.” Only problem is is that I can’t tell if I’ve been friend zoned or not, she is very flirty, is usually the first one to text me every day and on the days we are working together we are talking the whole time. I want to ask her out but she grew up and still is a strict primitive baptist, still lives with her family and her father is very protective and needs to know everyone she spends time with. I haven’t met him yet but I will soon I reckon. 

Here’s where I need the advice; do I ask her if we have a thing going on? Or do I let my sparks sizzle out and see where she goes with it.

Side note, she is 19 and I’m 24. Little bit of an age gap but nothing that is weird IMO.",romance
"Ok so I’m gonna be writing a novel through reddit, and it may go on for a loooong time so I mean, enjoy yourselves?














Prologue

The wind was cold on her pale cheeks, and her golden hair was swept in blowing curls behind her. The snowflakes settled on her black cloak, as if sprinkling it with glitter. She breathes in, then out, in slow motions, letting her mind roam free. She turns, seeing the arrow come towards her, and with a leap, and a quick kick in the air, she’s off the horse, arrow in hand. And she hollered, loud enough for her attacker to know to never attack once more.


Chapter 1


“Beth?” I can hear him calling. I throw on a nightgown, and scamper to the room beside mine. “Yes Father?” I call as I hurry to the study. He’s draped over the desk, his pen scribbling on the paper heavily and his brow furrowed. “Go fetch your Mother for me will you?” he barks out, treating me like a servant. “Father, I was going to go see the king.” I say, stopping in the doorway. “Fine.” He says with a huff, and reaches behind him to pull the bell to alert the servants.",romance

"I'm 24, a guy. 

My whole life has been a complete mess. 
From 14 - 22 I've been pretty much locked away from the world. 
Never being able to have friends, true love, a girlfriend.. I had a career forced on me, and though I passed my apprenticeship, the qualifications I got were meaningless in the real world, as I just couldn't work there. Because I couldnt stop getting these panic attacks and tremors, I felt so claustrophobic working there. 

At 23 I started a business in the only thing I could ( gardening ) I'm very physically fit and have a fit body ( who cares). I'm very busy and I work all the time now. I'm out alot. 
But that's where it ends.. who cares.. 

I can't enjoy my life, I can't eat in public, or go to bars, I haven't ever had a friend in years. I need true love. It's all I need. And no one will love me. I want to find my true love and love them. But nothing ever happens. 

Life keeps showing me a glimmer of hope, of what I could have, and then it snatches it away. It's so cruel. And all lies.

I'm just totally not allowed to have that. 

Even if I had millions of pounds, It wouldn't matter. I've gone too long alone. Even all my penpals I had, left me. 

I wrote a suicide note yesterday, and I tried to cut my wrists when everyone was out, but I couldn't stab the razor deep enough to do the job. 

Though I dont bother with ""help"". In the past I've been on every medication to help me, I don't need psychological help, it's a load donkey s**t in my opinion. Im not going back to them. They don't help you. There bad. 

I've had my life stolen from me, and no one cares when your damaged goods. I guess, who wants to love someone that can't go out and enjoy themselves?
No one. 

My family want me gone. 
The world wants me gone. 

I just cry alot in the night when I realise how I can be so lonely and that no one has ever wanted me or loved me.

The only reason I'm not on drugs is because I haven't got any contacts to get any. 

I need some joy in my life.. 

And if I sound selfish, then I guess I deserve to be alone because I've got things wrong with me. Even though I'm just being myself and going with the flow. I'm wrong and selfish "" that's why your alone"" Ok then, Thanks for that..",romance
"We took a two day break from talking due to me being busy. We FaceTimed again last night and we got really deep. She told me all about her ex and some problems she has. She seems to really be opening up. At one point I said “ _____ I really like talking to you because honestly I love studying and learning about you as a person” she then asked why? With a smile. I then said “ because your upbringing is so much different and the more I learn about you the more intrigued I get. She paused with a big smile and looked me in the eyes and then said thank you _____ after several hours we both got tired and we agreed that we should talk more because we both enjoy it. I said i felt like she was good for my soul. She smiled and said me too. She thanked me for talking to her and helping her with her problems. We then agreed that this summer we should hang out. I said we’ll cross that bridge when we get there and she smiled. The whole time I felt fuzzy inside. She said she’s never felt true affection and that she craves it. I think I’m in love

"So earlier this year I decided to join a dating app. I have never used one before and was pretty much desperate at that point. 

(I have worked through a lot of stuff sense then and I now know that at the time I was really craving friendship and an escape from loneliness. But at the time, I had that confused with needing/wanting a boyfriend) . 

I joined an app. Set up my profile. Swiped through some prospects. I found a guy. He was cute and we matched. I sent him a funny message and suddenly the ice was broken. 

We talked for awhile about simple stuff like how our day was going and what we planned to do after college. One day I was in class and we were snapping back and forth. It got a little flirty and long story short he asked me if I wanted to have dinner at his house that night. I said yes. 

We meet up and I was so surprised at how handsome he really was. I couldn't believe he wanted to talk to a girl like me. I was beyond nervous. We have dinner and get to know each other a bit more. He asked me why I was on the app and I said that I really didn't know, mostly just curious. So I asked him and he said he wasn't looking for a girlfriend at the moment. Mostly just trying to date. 

I wasn't exactly hurt by that because we had literally just met that day. After dinner we suddenly ended up on his bed listening to music and making out. He asked me if I wanted to have sex and I told him no. Part of me was really starting to like him and I didn't want to mess it up by having sex right away. He asked me why, and for some reason my spazzy brain decided to make a joke and say, I'm waiting until marriage. 

It totally killed the mood but....I never told him that I was joking. I dont know why. I just said it and kept it out there. He took me home and asked me on another date in a few days. My heart was so excited because I thought I had messed it up. 

A few days later we go for lunch and he did a complete 180. He barely smiled at me, our conversations were empty and it actually ""felt"" like he didn't want to be there. When he brought me back home I tried to goof around with him a little and he was not having it. After that date he ghosted me. I wasn't heartbroken because I barely knew him but for some reason that brief situation we had stuck with me. 

Fast forward 5 months to now. I just moved into a new place with some people I met through a roommate match service. Me and one other girl were moving in around the same time but oddly enough we kept missing each other because of school and work. 

One day I woke up from a really late nap and walked into the kitchen and saw a familiar looking jacket hanging by the door. You guessed it. 

My new roommate was the girlfriend of the guy I met from the dating app a few months back. I was filled with anxiety and hid immediately as they came into the room. After that day.  All she talks about is how sweet he is to her. How he cooks for her and refuses to let her clean. How he introduced her to his parents after 5 days of knowing each other. 

She always goes around the house basically on my shoulder all the time like my boyfriend always wants me to check in with him so he knows I got home safe. He screenshots my funny pictures I send him. He is so amazing. 

I know he was never my boyfriend and we were barely anything. But back then. It was like he treated me completely differently and for some stupid reason it has me looking back at that time wondering. What is so different about her. Why couldn't you have been that person for me? Did I do something wrong?

I dont know. Maybe because this odd and weird situation has come back and I have a front row seat for it, that it's making me have issues with my self worth.  Just had to get it off my chest.",romance

"Preface: I am here to share with everyone a peculiar experience that I've had. It's partly to get it all out on the table and in another part to see what others might have to say. I'm not used to Reddit and have usually just looked at the posts of others, so this is my first real post. I'll start this story chronologically as I feel it is easiest for readers to understand that way. I guess it is relevant to share that at the time of writing this, I am a 22 year old male.

&amp;#x200B;

It was the first week of June, 2014. I was 17 years old and only a few months away from being 18. All of my friends were a few years older than me, so they had graduated high school a few years ahead of me and went on to go to college together. Luckily for me, I kept up with them in the summer time: This summer had something special in store, and right at the start. We had planned for months to go to an anime convention and according to my research it was quite a popular annual affair for the anime nerdy types like myself. For my friends, it was their third or second time, but it was my first to this convention (or any convention for that matter). We drove 6 hours to get to the city where the convention was hosted and all crammed into a shitty little Red Roof Inn that was 10 mins from the convention site.

&amp;#x200B;

The day before the convention, I discovered that it was customary to get your badge so when the convention started you wouldn't have to wait through the first panels. At the eve of the convention opening there was a masquerade ball and I decided I would like to go, but my friends lacked my interest. Feeling that I was an independent and mature 17 year old (what 17 year old doesn't think they're mature?), I went on my own. I had never been to any sort of formal dance, so it sounded interesting to say the least, but that sort of thing had always caught my eye. I bought a mask in advance to coming to the convention and made sure to bring my only suit. I had the guys drop me off at the convention venue (a really ritzy and large hotel) and inside I went. A lot of the patrons were in cosplay or anime themed gowns, which was really fun to see.It was something new and I loved it, though it didn't play as much ballroom/waltz music as I expected or would have liked. I was lucky that they played a few 40s styled swing dance songs (I am a history major and I love the music from the 20s, 30s, and 40s in the U.S.).  I am a strange person in  that I am not initially outgoing when introduced to new people, but once the ball is rolling I am very outgoing, so I had a rough time finding a partner to dance. I'm only 5 Ft. 9 In. and very agile and thin. I've since put on some muscle, but back at the time I looked something close to Steve Rogers before Dr. Erskine's super soldier serum. Luckily I wasn't quite as bad as Steve Rogers, but you get my point.

&amp;#x200B;

I had made friends with a group of strangers, most of which did not know eachother prior to the masquerade ball. We danced to the modern pop music together and broke the ice.  Briefly the group split up to get drinks and due to my social success I was feeling a little more confident. A song I know very well came on, and in fact I had placed it upon the request list. The song was ""In the Mood"" by Glenn Miller, so I searched for a partner.

&amp;#x200B;

That was when I saw her. She had beautiful long auburn hair with blue eyes that seemed to peer into my soul. Her slender curves were complimented by a quaint emerald gown. From behind her gown I could see she was wearing the tale of a fox as a sort of cosplay item. She smirked at me with a confident gaze and my heart melted away nearly instantly. I was never used to that type of attention for a woman, so I glanced over my should to see if was looking at someone more sightly behind me. To my surprise, she was looking and smiling at me and by the time I turned back to face her she was approaching. As she stood before me, I was relieved to see that I had half an inch on her. She asked me if I would like to dance with her, and nervously I said yes. She asked if I liked to swing dance, and I gave her an answer in the affirmative. She and I began to swing dance at a comfortable pace; looking back, I can tell she was trying to gauge how comfortable I was. Once she saw that I knew how to swing dance, she picked up the pace and it was honestly impressive. I had taught myself how to swing dance, so I wasn't used to having such a skilled partner. She was still better than me, but I held my own. We worked so well together, that a crowd had formed around us to watch as we tore up the floor with our mad skills.

&amp;#x200B;

The song had ended and quickly the crowd dissipated because the DJ put on a slow dance song. She and I were out of breath and looked at eachother. She didn't even ask at this point, she grabbed my hands and places them upon her waist as she stepped closer to me. We shared that dance as we caught our breath, and I was uncertain how to proceed. Luckily for me, she took charge. She asked for my name, and I gave it to her. I asked for hers, and she told me it was ""Foxy"". I chuckled at the pseudonym, not because it was funny, but at the irony. Foxes were my favorite animal. Once I explained the coincidence, she chuckled too. I asked her this time, ""What's your real name?"" She told me that I would have to wait until midnight to find out when everyone took their masks off.  If she was trying to pique my interest, she had hit her mark. From this point onward, she and I spent the rest of the masquerade together. I introduced her to the other group of friends I had made that night. The masquerade ball proceeded with lots of dancing and fun.

&amp;#x200B;

After several hours of new friends and dancing, the ball drew to a close and our group of 5 people decided we weren't quite ready to call it quits. So we decided to go to IHOP and have some late night breakfast. I sat across from Foxy, who was just as stunning without her mask on. Throughout the meal and conversations, I caught her eyeing me and at other times she would catch me eyeing her. As we talked as a group, Foxy and I discovered that we had a lot of anime, music, and gaming interests in common. As we finished our meals, we exchanged numbers and decided to get some sleep before the start of the con the next day. I had arranged for my friends to pick me up at the IHOP and to the shitty Red Roof Inn I returned. Throughout the night Foxy and I texted eachother where she shared her real name. I'll call her Ella for the sake of anonymity. She and I had spent the rest of the night texting one another about what panels we wanted to go to together. I learned that 'Ella' was 21.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dawn of a New Day**

&amp;#x200B;

The first day of the con. I put on my first cosplay, and boy was I excited. I cosplayed a military alchemist from Fullmetal Alchemist. I don't have the natural haircolor to call myself Roy Mustang. I met up with 'Ella' at the con and we started out by going to a dancing instructional panel. We quickly found out we already knew what they had to offer and moved on. We looked at all the neat cosplays as we wondered to the dealers hall and artist's alley. We explored both to both the wares of all the artists and vendors and this lasted several hours. We then decided to find some food, and the hotel which hosted the con was very overpriced. We went across the street to a Denny's due to it's proximity, and it seemed many con-goers were onto the same idea as it was packed. I wish I had more noteworthy details to share about this day, but honestly it went by so quickly and with all the new sights it is hard explain everything. At the very least I can say I had a fantastic time. That evening there was a rave at which it seemed most of the con-goers were anticipated to attend. Of course, 'Ella' and met up and danced away until 4 in the morning. The tightly packed room proved instrumental for shoving us into one another in the chaos of the rave. It made for some good sexual tension, that's for sure. The tension built, but as 4 AM arrived, we retreated back to our respective hotels.

&amp;#x200B;

Another day and with it I brought another cosplay. It was a friend's costume that didn't fit him anymore, but it fit me perfectly. It was Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad from the first Assassin's Creed game. I wasn't a die hard fan, but I did very much like the first few installments of the series. I rocked that costume and 'Ella' seemed to thoroughly enjoy it as well. She was an aspiring photographer and artist and she was determined to catch some good photos of my cosplay. We spent the day together again and that night was yet another rave. Just as the previous night, we had one helluva time and the sexual tension peaked. We left the rave early and met up at a park. She picked the location as she was from the area and I was not (in hindsight, perhaps it wasn't a good idea to meet someone I just met at a discreet location at night, but hey. She wasn't an axe murderer so who cares, right?). At the park we talked for several hours about our lives, hopes, dreams, hobbies, and interests. The night ended with a passionate make out session between the two of us and it felt genuine. I had borrowed a friends car to see her, so once we decided it was time we drove back to our respective places (for me, the shitty Red Roof Inn).

&amp;#x200B;

**Dawn of the Final Day**

&amp;#x200B;

It was the last day of the con, and it was a half day. We spent as much time together as possible as we recognized that our time to part was fast approaching. I wanted to see the artists' alley and vendors' hall one last time as I heard there would be sales as it was the last day. The day seemed to have gone by very quickly and before we knew it the con was over. My friends and I decided we would leave the following morning, some of my friends had even left that night.

&amp;#x200B;

'Ella' and I continued to text eachother from our difficult parting at the con earlier that day, and decided we couldn't part like that. She came to meet me at my hotel and I saw her outside. You might think it's cheesy, but we made out on the hood of her car on the outskirts of the parking lot. We didn't have a whole lot of options, as for reasons I don't entirely recall, we couldn't go to her place. Well the make out became quite heated and a certain point arrived that we decided we wanted to go somewhere more private. My friend very kindly let his car, so 'Ella' and I found somewhere discreet to park. We made out again, but this time it continued into something further. We had passionate sex in the back of my friends car, and then cuddled for awhile. It was 4 AM when we decided we needed to part again. Before we parted, we made it official that we would try to make long distance work.

&amp;#x200B;

I came back to the shitty Red Roof Inn and slept for a few hours before the long drive home. Luckily I didn't have to drive for most of it. Were I not excited to text 'Ella"", I would have slept the whole trip home.

&amp;#x200B;

A month passes by and 'Ella' and I Skype'd (because it was 2014) every day. I had fallen hard for this woman, she was beautiful, kind, funny, nerdy (like me), and always optimistic. She was a free spirit who had simple dreams to be a photographer who traveled in a Jeep across the country. My own dreams were to be someone of importance: To be someone worth remembering. My aspirations were to become an officer in the United States Air Force and hopefully fly (I am still in fierce pursuit of this dream today, and it's going well despite the inevitable roadblocks). Our dreams didn't quite coincide together, but we lived over 200 miles apart as it was and neither of were ever close to reaching our dream yet. My hope was that if we lasted that long, we would cross that bridge when we go to it. We were both very supportive of eachother and it was a genuinely happy time for me. My only longing was to see her in person again.

&amp;#x200B;

A month into our relationship and such an opportunity arises. My grandfather (I was raised by my grandparents) had a business trip in the area which 'Ella' lived, and he needed me to help him. He was picking up a vehicle from a dealership and he needed someone (myself) to help him drive the second vehicle. Well, while in the area I 'got lost' and met up with 'Ella'. Our visit lasted 45 minutes, and they went by so soon. We passionately made out at our reunion, all in the back of a new vehicle. My grandfather was calling to 'help' me navigate to his location for lunch and we knew our reunion was short lived. I wore a button-up red, green, and brown plaid shirt over a t-shirt with the buttons unbuttoned. She asked to keep my overshirt because it smelled like me and I obliged.

&amp;#x200B;

Our visit was short and that was bitter for 'Ella' and I. Two weeks passed without event or change in behavior. I was almost 18, but as much as I wouldn't like to admit it at the time, I was a kid. As such, I was a faithful Boy Scout (Eagle Scout in fact) and I was in attendance to a high adventure camp in the Colorado area. The trip featured white water rafting and an over night backpacking trip. The location of the camp had shit service and I religiously searched for all the spots I could have reception to reach 'Ella'. I messaged her as frequently as I could and into the late hours of the night, standing in the most awkward places as it was the only place I had reception. I shared with her the highlights of my trip and she would share with me the highlights of her day. Well the week had passed and it was time to go home and by the time I finally had a steady reception things took a nose dive for me.

&amp;#x200B;

'Ella' messaged me on Skype where she said she wanted to talk about something, and I knew something was amiss. Who doesn't get nervous at those words? She said that she wanted to break up with me because she felt that I deserved something better. I told her that I wanted to be with her, but she insisted. Dejectedly, I conceded after my brief resistance to the notion of breaking up. The time we shared together was precious to me, and I didn't want to lose her entirely. My only request was that we still be friends at which she obliged.

&amp;#x200B;

Time had passed without talking, at least a month. I figured she needed distance, and I wasn't sure I couldn't make things weird so I stayed way. I figured she would talk to me when she was ready, but I was mistaken. Figuring that a month was an appropriate time already, I tried to reach out to her and found that she had removed me from social media and Skype. I was obviously sad, but what could I do? I sat and watched from a distance at her Facebook. It took about two months or so for her to find someone else, and I found that to be normal. I considered that perhaps she could have found someone else, of which she left me for? I really haven't seen any evidence for that, and I don't like speculation. Regardless, I came crashing down from cloud 9.

&amp;#x200B;

My 18th birthday had arrived and with it came some special opportunities to make some money through my grandfather's trade. It required me to get a special license, and to get that license I had to go to the same area as 'Ella'. I decided I would shoot my shot and try to talk to her. While there, I texted her. To my dismay, she didn't respond as I was hoping for. She told me to ""Forget about her"" because she and I were just a ""summer fling"". Well, that's that I suppose, right? 'Ella' was the one who got away.

&amp;#x200B;

I can be a little obsessive, and this has helped me greatly with my ambitions to become a pilot. The drawbacks are being obsessive aren't good for personal matters such as mine with 'Ella'. Most others would have moved on, but I never did (and still haven't). I continued to keep tabs on her as the job with my grandfather gave me the resources to. I never tried to reach out to her, pester, or make amends. Once every month or so I would see what she was up to and then continued with my life. I admit, it was stalkerish of me, but I never tried to bother her. I watched as she got married and then had children. She eventually got the Jeep she told me she wanted so badly. Of course, she never did become a traveling photographer, but such is life. I kept away because I knew there was no chance: Ever. But still, I didn't have it in me to stop keeping tabs. It's how I am with everything. Without a constant flow of current information, I grow anxious. Simply knowing just puts me at ease.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried my best to be happy for her, but to me she would always be the one that got away. When I was that young 17 year old when she left me, I had hoped that I might have another chance when I was older and had more prospects. Perhaps if I had lived closer. Regardless, she became a small blip on my radar as I embarked on my quest to become an Air Force pilot. Sometimes months went by without my desire to peak at her Facebook page.

&amp;#x200B;

During a summer two years later, in the early part of June, 2016 and  I had gone to the same convention (which was at the exact same place as it was in 2014. I had attended 2015's convention too, but that story has not relevance to this one). At the preregistration of the first day, I ran into 'Ella' and her husband. They were pushing a stroller, and in an instant I recognized her. I was with my best friend. I was awestruck, but my instincts quickly kicked in. I immediately turned around and walked the other way. Luckily for me, I was in full cosplay and it seemed like she didn't notice me. I was dressed as Captain America from the First Avenger before he got his dedicated uniform. I had an authentic M1 helmet of which I painted blue. I painted a white 'A' on the forehead of the helmet and placed aviation goggles upon the helmet. I wore an intentionally weathered leather jacket with green fatigue pants, black paratrooper jump boots, and I had the stars and striped theme undershirt. Hopefully my description helps. The piece of resistance was my shield. I made it myself from some sturdy steel. It was three pointed shield like Cap's first shield in the comic and movies. The last two years had been kind to me, at least in regards to my physique. I had gained a considerable amount of muscle, specifically for the cosplay. At the time, I assumed that my cosplay and change in physique had kept her from noticing me.

&amp;#x200B;

I went on through the con with my best friend like all was normal. I did not go out of my way to look for her, but I kept an eye out. I never did see her again. It was a big con after all and many people were in attendance.

&amp;#x200B;

Another year and a half pass (November 2017), and to my surprise she messages me on Facebook. I had not kept tabs on her for several months as I had become very busy with my goals. Her message was an apology. She said she had done some introspection and thought of me. She said she felt like ""a royal ass"" for the way she treated me. I humbly accepted the apology and told her I was glad to hear from her. We caught up with one another and shared the progress we had made in our lives with one another. She told me that she did recognize me that day in June 2016. She had two children now from her husband. We agreed we would be friends for real this time.

&amp;#x200B;

However like before, some considerable time passed before we talked. I looked at her Facebook page as was my sparse habit. I discovered that she had once again removed me from Facebook as a friend and this struck me as odd. I had my speculation as to why, but never could quite put my finger on it. I continued focusing on my ambitions and decided not to reach out about it.

&amp;#x200B;

This brings my story to the present. A few days ago I decided to look at her Facebook page for the first time in 6 months. I noticed that she posted a TikTok video of herself in cosplay. I couldn't resist and I downloaded TikTok to check it out. I found her account and was once again awestruck. It was the first time I had heard her voice since we had dated. I planned on keeping under the radar like I always had been. I never wanted to make myself known or to disturb her daily life. I made an account under the name of my WoW character's last name (because I'm a roleplayer) and used artwork of him as a profile picture. I didn't expect her to recognize the name, and the picture had been commissioned long after she and I had dated. I followed her TikTok and liked several of her videos there. She was kind of popular on TikTok with over 10,000 followers. She was getting tens of followers a day, so I figured I would blend in easily with the traffic.

&amp;#x200B;

Sure enough, several hours later I get a private message from her on TikTok asking if it was me. I was absolutely appalled. How did she know it was me? I never wanted to approach her, yet here she was approaching me. I did lie, I replied honestly and said that it was me. I asked how she knew to which she responded with that she recognized the character in the profile picture as something I tried to have her draw when we were dating. Even then, that surprised me as my character had no special feature to him. In fact, my WoW character's appearance is heavily influenced by Big Boss from Metal Gear Soilid 3, and he often gets mistaken as Snake from MGS. The sheer odds that from the multitudes of people who follow her on the daily, that she picked me out from the character concept I used as a profile picture are just astronomical.

&amp;#x200B;

I swiftly apologized. I did not forget the fact that she removed me as a friend on Facebook, and I figured my following her was not to her liking with that in mind. I told her that I didn't want to cause any trouble. She dismissed my apology and told me not to worry about it. We proceeded to catch up like we had a year and a half before. Later that evening she messaged me to chat, she said she wasn't feeling quite right and wanted someone to talk with. I was oblivious and missed her message. Once I saw it (at 2 AM because I'm an idiot) I replied asking what was wrong. I saw that she posted a video and I'm not sure if it has any relevance to me or not. The video was brief and it was her drawing. Before it showed her drawing it showed a written message saying that her state of mind wasn't the greatest, so she drew that to cope with it. The drawing featured a girl falling headfirst. Simple enough, right? The thing that caught my eye were the hashtags on the video's description. ""&lt;3 #falling #art #artist #sketch #sad #cope #coping #waterfountain #love #falling #cute #4u"". Did this have any reference to me? Am I just being obnoxiously conceited to consider that? I'm torn 50/50 on that part. I have no clue what's going on in her life. Maybe she's talking about some variable entirely unknown to me. Perhaps she's talking about the artwork. The thing is about the artwork, the drawing is given a whole new meaning with the context of the aforementioned hashtags. I've decided that I'll never know really what it was about.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where fate decided to play with me. The very next day, I embarked on a short roadtrip to her area again. I had a friend who is studying abroad who needed to be dropped off at the airport. So, a day after she and I talk again, necessity brings me to her area. I try to keep that fact subtle when talking to 'Ella' as I figured it might come off the wrong way if I openly advertised it. I gently let the information out that I was in the area. I asked for advice on where to eat and good anime shops to visit. I took her advice, and promptly left. I made not attempt to physically see her, and I think that was a wise decision on my part. I continue to chat with her sparsely on average throughout my day. And that brings me to now.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this story was all over the place, but that's that. I really just needed to type it all out to organize my thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

The song, ""I Just Died in Your Arms Tonight"" by Cutting Crew comes to mind when I think of this whole mess.

" 

Every morning we wake up to a kiss and a cuddle

and maybe even some passionate morning sex

We start the day off by being so close in each others arms

Even if its quick because we woke up a little late.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyday we begin the day with such love.

Everyday we begin the day feeling special

We start off the day knowing we are truly loved,

With a smile and a big spring in our step.

&amp;#x200B;

We grab our coffee and go about our day,

working, events, childcare, etc…....

We go about the day always thinking of each other

sending the odd “I love you” “I miss you” texts throughout the day.

&amp;#x200B;

We are hopeless, We are in love

And nothing can get in the way

Nothing could distract us

Or turn our heads away.

&amp;#x200B;

We both feel so safe and secure,

We both are sure that we are truly loved

We have each other back

Through the good days and bad.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of a hard day at work

We come home to a love like no other

There to offer a warm hug and great encouragement

As we put our day aside to enjoy our evenings together.

&amp;#x200B;

We enjoy our evenings together as we are on this crazy adventure

We make each day count as we are never promised another

We walk on the beach and dance under the stars

We make beautiful love through everything we do.

&amp;#x200B;

We lay on the sofa to watch a good movie

As we unwind from a hectic day

We take in a deep breath as a sigh of relief

That we are home with our true love feeling so safe.

&amp;#x200B;

Our life is a wonderful adventure

More love than we have ever known

We feel like we can do anything

As we make each other our king and queen.

&amp;#x200B;

We just love being together

And being each other very best friend

We love traveling, going to concerts, doing life together

And living a life true adventure.

&amp;#x200B;

Our love is very special and can never be questioned

The love that we have can never be tainted

It wouldn't matter if a true beauty queen or a hunk came along

We'd no that's just surface and not worth a second look.

&amp;#x200B;

We are so perfect for each other

That we cherish our love

We treat each other amazingly

the romance and love will never die!",romance
"*(metaphorically)*

We've been dating about 2 years now, and when we started, I was a depressed mess on the tail end of a decade-long struggle with self hatred. I gave up on all my life's dreams because I did poorly in school, dropped out of university, and didn't like my appearance in general.  I'd mostly bottled up my feelings but one day, when I was having a particularly rough few days, he saw the writing on the wall and talked me down from it. I was immediately blown away by how caring and sweet he was, his mannerisms were so genuine and I desperately wanted to hug him within only an hour of chatting.

After about 2 months, we started flirting and it sort of all just developed from there. He slowly gave me my confidence back, I started working again and within a year considered going back to uni and giving it a serious try this time. He told me that no matter what happens, he'll always stay by my side, even in times of insecurity. I usually go into relationships believing that both parties should work hard to ensure that they're life long, and I'm so happy that I finally met someone who believes that too! For the first time in my adult life, I'm happy, and it's all thanks to him. To say I love him is an understatement, I think he's my soulmate. After years of shitty bfs I think he's finally the one!!! I love everything about him, he's smart (denies it), handsome (denies it), strong willed, empathetic, and most of all committed.

I love when it rains at night, it makes it easier to sleep and stuff, but it can't even compare to his voice! Over the years I've drifted off to the sound of his voice many times, and had the best nights of my life as a result.

I love him unconditionally and unwaveringly. We've argued a few times, but always been able to bounce back, and even if I get frustrated with him, I never want to leave. Not now, not ever. I want to be the last thing on his mind before he goes to sleep, like he is for me. For the rest of our lives.

(I'm sorry, I just had to let it all out, he's sleeping and I don't want to wake him up ;-;)",romance
"So, for the past 2 years I've been in love with his girl but as you read in the title, she has a boyfriend. That's not really the problem here, the question is... I'm stupid for saving me for this girl even though most likely we never will more than friends? I tried to get over her and meet new girls but I feel horrible about it. In my brain I know I should move on but my heart tells me that there may be hope. We have  some friends in common and they all root for me, they also say that her boyfriend is a piece of shit (lol). Maybe that's where my hope is? I never confessed to her because I respect her relationship. Also because my previous relationship ended thanks to a guy confessing to my girlfriend knowing she was with me, and sadly she ended up cheating with him . I don't want to be that type of person who steals another's girl.",romance
"Like I met this woman somehow, she asked for contact stuff, but I guess we are just study partners... at least that is what I am trying to tell myself to not get too hopeful... on the other hand I wish it would turn into something more or that she sees it as something more than just being study partners.

However I am in this loop of usually thinking about her. Why is this annoying? Well, it is, because before I met her I was in the mindset of ""I HAVE TO LEARN. I HAVE TO PASS THESE EXAMS"" now my thoughts are more like ""does she like me actually, like romantically? uuuuggggghhhhhhhhh""..... I am pathetic.....

Edit: Thanks for the replies! I realized that I was worrying over nothing here. I will just be me and make my move and if that doesn't get reciprocated then there is not much else I can do.",romance
"Me and my partner have been together for quite awhile (a little over a year and a half) and he enjoys it when I say anything romantic to him. However, I’m not really good at it and most of the time I don’t know how to put my feelings into words or what to say entirely. Help?",romance
"ok. so i like this guy and he's petty cute. we used to run track together and i sort of fell in love with him. hes funny, sweet, cute, and pretty amazing. so halfway through realizing i liked him, he and some friends were behind me and one of them said (i think to him), if you dont ask her out her heart is going to be broken. and i was 100% sure they weren't talking about me. 

however, i still have a crush on him. now flash forward to yesterday. i was waiting and he and some friends were talking and one of them says, ""hey we gotta hurry up to catch up to your girlfriend."" Im not sure if it was to him and it might have been.  so yeah thats great

so i sort of have a half formed plan. one of my frinds is gong to be helping out at a place that he is going to be. when he comes by, she's going to tell him that i like him. not a good plan but its a plan

is that too weird??? like, as a girl, i have no idea what he would want, but im lowkey so lost and need some help . he's srt of a sk8ter boi (u know what i mean right?) and a little edgy if that makes any difference with the answer.",romance
"I've known a guy for 7ish years and we have always been best friends. I love him and enjoy spending time with him but I am not ""in love"".  I have never been attracted to him physically, or romantically (or anyone else for that matter).  We have been long distance for nearly 7 years and short distance/actually dating one year.  We had a seamless transition to living together, and get along great. He's my very best friend. I'm 26 years old and he's my first and only relationship. When we began dating I told myself romantic love fades in relationships so it is not as important as love in general. I'm afraid to lose him, but at the same not unsure if this is how a relationship should feel. So...What I'm asking is if you were in my shoes do you feel a friendship is enough, or is a romantic love needed in a marriage?",romance
"She's fucking great! We have been together for 8 months. I'm moving in with her next week. She's always been a giver, emotionally and physically. I'm the same too, we help each other the best we can. 

I have recurring depression and she has fibromyalgia. We both have debilitating illnesses. We both care for each other as best as we can. She feels like she is a burden and so do I. But we support each other to no end.

That's been our drive for a while. But today, she fooled me. She always tricks me! She's smart and beautiful. She always beats me at scrabble!! 83 points with three words!! Absolute bitch I tell ya! 

Anyways, I came back to her place after drinking all day. She had a bad day with a migraine and I took care of her before I went out. She told me that the place was a mess because she's been trying and that's what I expected. I said it clean it all up the next day. Turns out, she'd organised her wardrobes. One for me and one for her. Plus she organised all my books on the window cill next to my bed. She said she wanted me to feel welcome living in her apartment. 

I feel like the luckiest guy alive. So tomorrow I'm cooking her a full english breakfast and all the cups of tea she needs. So yeah, I'm gonna marry this girl one day and wanted to tell reddit about it. 

My first proper post to reddit. Thought it'd be worth it.",romance
So I really like this girl we’re teens and I’ve started talking to her recently she’s just so beautiful kind and she has great taste tldr I really like her. There are hints that she likes me she went silent after I talked about one of my other female friends and her best friend was telling me she loves me as a joke but I think it could be true I don’t know I’d love opinions because I really like her and honestly am thinking about asking her out.,romance
"So I was sitting with my 2 best friends and chatting about normal stuff. There were 2 nice looking girls in front of us. Then, one of them came up to me and asked me if the other girl was cute. I ignored cuz I believed it was a troll since i'm one of these 16 yr olds that are always in the corner lol. Then, I akwardly looked at her and said ""u talking to me?"" She said yes and yeah since the way she talked seemed like a troll I decided to troll too and said, yeah she's cute but I deserve better. (I said that cuz I was too shy to go and speak with her) Then she laughed and told the other innocent looking girl that I rejected her l. She didn't seem too happy, then she stood up and kissed my best friend as she was watching me and tried to make me jealous then they left. I was like HOLY SHIT DUDE I DIDN'T KNEW I LOST A CHANCE TO KISS A GIRL. So then, me full with regretful of doing we followed them, and they saw was and said ""hey you with glasses *laughs in a sexy way* are you following us?"" I lost my words again and instead of saying something cool or romantic I said ""ehm no just passing by"" then they left...I'm so mad at myself for not having courage to talk to a girl, like i'm always too shy and losing words...please give me advice or something I wanna stop being like that..",romance

So how do I(20 female) know if i'm in love or just want to be closer friends to someone?

He's a istp (19 male) that we are close friends even though we don't talk much.I think its due to working together in school projects most of the time and i did ask him face on if we are close friends. I've known him for 3 years but deep inside,i know i'm not really that close to him since i don't know anything about him outside from the time i meet him in school.Usually this doesn't bother me with friends since i'm not sure if i want to keep this bond between him alive after graduation(I've only have 2 friends which was kept with low effort since they live far from me and they are usually busy so we don't do meetups like at all but we do keep in contact a few times per few months and it doesn't feel like we have grown apart so far)

But...

Nowadays,i had this want to keep this strong friendship even after graduation and it doesn't help that i have 3 separate dreams where i was chatting real excited like an extrovert to him alone and the feeling was always warm and fluffy like although i don't feel lust towards him.I frequently check my ig story and see if he did saw my story and each time he saw my story or liked my post,i would feel slightly happier than my other friends since its like he noticed me in a way.(I dont usually feel this way when my other friends liked or saw my post) I've also felt embarrassed when talking about romance with him alone vs me being confused by people's dumb action when 'in love' with other friends in a group.I also just had this want to know more about him in terms of how he thinks,how he see the world etc just recently and am giving some of my time within reasons to hang out with him and if possible alone so that i can ask more personal questions and know him more face to face.I find it hard to hang out or talk to people without a purpose so this is a first for me to ask personal questions and trying to find reasons to see him face to face and talk to him more.I find myself jealous or sad when he talks and have more physical contact to his other male friends more compared when he talks to me sometimes because i want to be that guy when he talk cause he feel more in his comfort zone than when talking to me.I also like the sound of his voice,i do think he's cute although i don't strongly feel those warm fluffy feeling that i have when i'm in love with a franchise or book.But sometimes i had this feeling of just holding his hand,hugging,being in close contact with him and even kissing him like what couples do although there's no lust feeling whatsoever since i'm bored of porn(its like watching animal zoo tbh)

What i want from him is not a couple status although i do think its nice but i want him to feel that i am trust-able to the point where he's isn't afraid to talk to me because of his own fear,society or self expectation etc and i'll like to do the same for him. I've also come to my own conclusion and is sure that he's an istp(even though i didn't ask him to do the mbti quiz since i want to know more about him first hand) and done some reading on how to catch his interest,talk longer,predicting what he like and putting it into action.

I'm so confused even though i do read what being in love is like but it just doesn't feel right.Mainly because i don't feel lust towards him but i want him to accept who i really am when i do expose my inner self and i want to do the same for him.

So what do you think?Am i in love or just want to really be friends to him in the long run?",romance
"She was his perfection in a world filled with flaws. Everyday he would look at her and wonder how perfection was so close but felt so far. It was her smile that first caught his attention then she spoke and he felt a connection. He looked for a flaw anything to bring him back to reality but there was nothing just perfection standing there with a smile that lit up a room and a heart that left even the heavens wondering about there creation.
He remembered every word of there conversation even when he realized they really spoke of nothing at all. Just two people passing time but to him it was everything it was the gospel in words he understood. Then she smiled and he was hooked needed to know more he wanted answers to questions he had yet to think about. He hungered for more information on her.
As he lay in bed that night he could not sleep he wondered where her dreams were taking her. Could he be the one to protect her from the nightmares she may be having. The last thought before finding the peacefullness of his own slumber was that tomorrow, will be the day that he will prove not only to himself but to her that he is worthy of her attention.
As the sun rose to another day his mind raced as his heart tried to catch up. Yes today was the day. He finally reaches his destination. she is only a few feet away everything around him moves in slow motion the more he moves toward her the futher she feels. A smile on her face was it directed towards him but how could it be she is facing down. 
That device the one that has taken away human communication shes smiling at an object with no emotion ,he stops. Why do you not save that smile for a person for someone who can smile back. Her fingers touching the glass the smile gets wider. Nooooo he screams in his mind ,that object does not deserve such beauty. Then without warning a pair of hands covers her eyes.
Again the smile fills her face the device goes into her pocket. She turns putting her arms around him. His face an expression of nothing . Her face brighter then a thousand suns but his as dull as the lead of an unsharpened pencil.
Why do you choose him the one with no emotion. The one who does not see your smile as the sunset and your laughter as the sunrise. Why ?",romance

" Hi guys. This is my first entry here and, I decided to make an account in this place because I would feel very embarrassed to say this in front of another person. I 'm a 25 years old girl. I always focused on my hobbies and being a successful woman. Don't consider myself unattractive but not so beautiful. 0 experience in love. 

 Had cancer two years ago. My family left me alone. I was unemployed, my best friend died at that moment, it was a disaster. I didn't want to disturb anyone, so i decided to face it alone.

One day i discovered a facebook page referring to my favorite video game. Everything normal at the beginning, jokes and memes. It sounds absurd, but it's funny how something so small keeps you alive in the most difficult times. Time passed. I overcame cancer. Everything was better. When I saw that one of the administrators of the page was upset about something, i encouraged myself and drew a picture for him. So far, i think he is an important part of my life. So i wanted to make him happy, even if it was something momentary that he could forget later. 

One day I decided to talk to him privately and become his friend. He's kind and funny, more than  expected. We have some things in common. i continued writing to him from time to time.  he sent me a song. When i heard it, i found myself identified and .. FEELS! i told him how much he means to me. Since then, i think, i began to have feelings for him. He strives daily and wants to improve himself. That, definitely made me love him more. 

I think he's not interested in me. So i leave all of that aside and continue without bothering him. 

When I decided to post a picture of myself, he became interested a bit. Then I showed him a nicer picture, and suddenly I found him very interested. Actually that made me happy but  it seems that is the only thing he likes about me. I decided to confess and apparently it is reciprocal. I cannot believe it. So we decided not to advance until i see him in person to confess properly. 

Although, sometimes he shows disinterested. I'm not really the kind of girl he likes. I like him a lot, so i don't want to seem creepy by harassing him with unnecessary questions. He is a busy person and i´m too, but i can't get him out of my head! I want to go through the stupid forest to go see him and hug him!

I even see him interested in other girls, but really, I dont want to give up. 

I know that's selfish. But i feel so insecure in those moments that i dont know what to do. Help!!!",romance

" 

Hello!

I have a bit of a first world boy-related issue which I just need advice and speculation on from people I don't know, so I'd be really really grateful if anyone has anything to say about this!

I have no experience in love or dating, so I don't really know what's going on to be honest.

So, it's a long story...

I'm at the end of Year Eleven now; my exams start on Monday. At the beginning of Year 10, I was put in a new History class with my favourite teacher, and a lot of people from the other side of the school who I didn't know as well at the time.

I was really quiet and shy, and therefore not one of the 'cool people'. I was sat in the middle of a row at the back of the classroom, in the middle of two boys I didn't know. One of them was more popular and we got on really well and had a laugh.

I didn't really talk to the other one. I had a but less tolerance at the time and the sounds he was always making with his retainer and knuckles really irritated me.

We didn't really get on.

However, as time went on, we started to talk a bit more and really get on. We were both really good at History and worked very well together, so in all of the seating plans since (they're not changed often in that class) we've been sat next to each other, which we've both been happy about.

And by the beginning of this academic year we were really good friends, following each other on social media and had a laugh in class together. But then I started getting signals.

I wasn't sure, but something seemed to tell me that he liked me, and for several months I went over it in my mind, dismissed it, in a never-ending cycle which I thought had really ended every time I dismissed it again.

The signs only got stronger.

And then I had a dream. I dreamt that I went out with him and I got excited about it with my now ex-best friend. This massively confused me because I didn't fancy him, and I stayed in the same cycle - did he like me? Did I like him? Dismissed... and then again because I did not know the answer to any of those questions.

We started to message a lot more (admittedly I initiated it a lot, but only because I wanted to strengthen our friendship, and in fairness I got a lot back) and there was some awkwardness because we were breaking into it. We mainly talked about school stuff, and he was always very supportive of my ambitions, and we started to have some private jokes.

By this point it definitely seemed like he liked me. So I thought about it, and it didn't take long for me to finally admit that I liked him (although I was in denial for about a week so my friends forced my confession out of me). 

He did not get on at all with my best friend - who shared a class with him - and they ended up constantly (and still now) throwing insults at each other, but the stories were always quite amusing. 

We messaged and messaged, and we started to flirt. And then it escalated quite a lot and got quite consistent, and he basically said that he liked someone and that he sat next to them in our class last year and this year and now, and their name begins with E. So he told me it was me and that he would ask me out, but we talked about this all under the impression of 'him telling me who it is'. So he said that he would 'tell me who it is' tomorrow. But then he procrastinated and the moment sort of went so he didn't. He said that he didn't like anyone, and I asked him why he told me that he did in that case. He said that it was 'April Fool's I guess' and that he was just going with whatever was going on. I told him that I wasn't quite sure what he thought he was going with because nothing was going on and he said 'neither am I'.

So that was not fun.

But that's only the middle of this story!

We only have that one lesson together, so we only had one lesson left until the upcoming two-week holiday. I was absolutely dreading it and there was so much build up to it, but he didn't turn up, which was a relief.

This meant that we had a two week break as a buffer between that point and the next lesson so that we could pretend it hadn't happened. I was actually quite grateful for that. He shouldn't have been able to show his face (although at a later point he told me it was because of the orthodontist, but it wasn't on the register so I'm just convinced he was avoiding it - or at least delaying if he actually was at the orthodontist).

So the first lesson we had after the holidays was less of a thing because it was all over and done with, it 'hadn't happened' and was 'forgotten about'. We spent the first twenty minutes in the most awkward and excruciating silence I have EVER experienced, and I have experienced A LOT of awkward silences!! The teacher talked for about ten minutes, and then we got started on a sheet. We spent all of this time looking absolutely everywhere else but at each other and I was basically pretending that he didn't exist. I was trying to act normal, and for the entire time I was debating in my head whether to ask him how his holidays were because that is what I would have done ordinarily, and therefore not asking him that would establish that it was awkward and therefore that something had actually happened which I remembered. But I didn't build up the courage to, and after the first twenty minutes he finally said something random about the sheet.

I didn't even hear what he said. I was shocked that he'd spoken, and so relieved that he was the first one to speak; to establish that we were acting normal and it had never happened. 

""Hmm, sorry what?"" I stuttered.

He repeated it and I still hadn't heard but I just smiled slightly and said ""Yeah, that's true.""

And in that moment some sort of sad understanding seemed to pass between us.

And so conversation started, and didn't really flow at first; it was really awkward but a relief just because it was some conversation and a pretention that everything was normal and nothing had happened. And then he just wouldn't stop talking! It was awkward smalltalk conversation, but there was definitely a lot to say - we both rambled a lot. 

At some point before the next lesson, I 'accidentally' sent him a post on Instagram (it was just a nice library picture) just to diffuse the tension. I quickly said 'shit sorry I meant to send that to Anna' (my friend) but he laughed and said that it's fine. We used to text every single day so that stopped the awkwardness in the fact that we hadn't messaged since and that what had happened was the last thing on our conversation screen. 

We didn’t talk beyond that, and when we got to our next lesson I was exhausted (I suffer from insomnia, so this is normal for me), and he appeared to get quite bored by me, which irritated me because I’m not here to please anyone! The next lesson I basically put no effort in at all, but it turned out that that made him try even harder! It actually ended up as quite a fun experiment. The less I talked, the more he talked. And I mean seriously, he rambled on and on and on, and ended up talking about his metabolism, which was random! It was amusing after what he’d done, to see him grasping at straws to stay afloat, and putting in all the effort. Although of course I am exaggerating; I didn’t completely leave him to it, but my point is that he felt the need to fill in absolutely every gap and I wouldn’t have even needed to contribute anything to the conversation for a lot of the lesson because he would just say anything. It was a good sign that he was trying; he was fighting to keep our friendship afloat.

The next time we texted was when I asked him what we would be doing next lesson (in the class we shared together) so that I could bring in the right book. He wasn’t sure either and he could have then ended the conversation, but he did seem to be making an effort to keep it open. He didn’t really ask me questions but he kept saying stuff and kept it very open when he just didn’t need to.

So we got back to talking and our friendship strengthened. We both made an effort in class and there was no awkwardness; we had a really good laugh. 

Then he admitted that he likes this other girl at school, and they’re also really good friends and talk and call really often. Like, they’re **really** close friends. Me and him always tend to message every day now because we’re really good friends, so we talk about this a lot now. When he said that he liked her, I agreed that I’d help find out if she liked him. We argued earlier about the fact that he was procrastinating just asking her out and getting it over with. And then later on today I messaged her and found out that she definitely doesn’t like him because she likes someone else. He asked me what she said and I told him the general gist, but he basically said that he has a chance with everyone so he’ll just ‘work his magic’ (which is laughable). But then he said that it seems dodgy, and I agreed, but he hadn’t finished. He said that it seems dodgy; pretending to like someone in order to procrastinate. 

And to me, that seemed dodgy.

He kept making excuses not to ask her out/tell her how he feels and tried to get into normal conversation about these random things, apart from one part of the conversation. He asked me if I would ask someone if I was in his situation, and I said no because I’d want them to work for me so that I have value, social etiquette etc. etc.. He said, “So”, “if you liked someone” “And they liked you back and you thought it was obvious” “You’d do something?” And I said no because they need to be prepared to work for me because otherwise I wouldn’t have value and it sets out the whole dynamic of the relationship, etc., etc. And he just said that he supposes so. And then he started to talk about one of his excuses not to ask her out again.

It just seems odd. 

Because I don’t know if he does actually like me, or if he did actually like me or if this is still part of one big joke from before, or if did like me and he still does and he’s trying to make me jealous, or if he did like me, he actually does like her now, or if he liked me before, he likes me now and they’re both in this to try and get me and him together in some mad way?

I have no idea what is going on and I just really really need some advice, opinions and ideas. ANY will do, please! 

Oh, he also said earlier on that they were maybe meeting up over the weekend, and she told me that he asked and he said no. So the other option is that before, everything was a joke, he legit does like her now but she’s hiding what’s going on completely from me, even though me and her are really good friends and we always tell each other about this?!

how old were you when you first started having them?  did you have a lot, or a lot at once? If you found out that person had a crush on you too would you be excited about it?

how does a crush differ from sexual desire or finding someone attractive? how would you describe romantic feelings?

Anyways, we talked for about 2 months (periodically) before actually meeting because our work schedules were pretty conflicting and I live about an hour away. I could tell from his texts that he seemed like a pretty down to earth guy and I was excited for our date, but was trying to not to get my hopes up too much. Well turns out he’s adorable and I was instantly attracted to him and his personality. He isn’t a hunk with a 6 pack and chiseled jaw law,  he’s actually on the shorter side with an average body type, but omg he’s the sexiest man I have ever met. He has these golden brown eyes that I could gaze into forever and a cute little Chicago accent. I’m sort of a hopeless romantic if you can’t tell, but this one knocked it out of the park for me. I don’t fall for people very often and haven’t felt this way in awhile. So this has been a real struggle for me. So here it goes, our first date went well and I felt like we both had a really good time. We went to 3 bars talked a lot and danced and it just felt natural. I spent the night at his place but we didn’t have sex because we were both pretty drunk honestly ( I know real classy, but it just happened). So fast forward to now about another 2 months later he finally has some time off work and asks me if I would like to see each other again while he is off. I say of course and we agreed to meet on a Friday that week because I was going to be out there for an interview anyways. When I told him I had an interview his eyes lit up and our whole date he was saying how he really hoped I got the job so I can eventually move closer. Our date went really well again. I spent the night, magic happened and then went home after we had breakfast. He was texting me everyday up until I was supposed to get my results for the interview. I never heard from them and all he really said was “damn”. And he hasn’t texted me since. It hurts, I’m not gona lie. I feel rejected on both ends for not getting the job and him ending it because I live  too far basically. Our schedules do conflict but I feel that if we really wanted to make it work we could. And I would be willing to do this. But now I feel that this is the end of the road because I didn’t get this job.. and it just feels unfair. What do I do?

"Me (16M) and my best friend (16F) have been friends for upwards of 10 years. We always enjoyed each other's company and have never fought or argued in the slightest and our families are also very good friends. We text and face time constantly and i've been secretly in love with her for the past 5 years although I doubt she feels the same way, which just makes this worse. We also don't go to the same school anymore so I can't see her in person as often as I would like to. Anyways, everything is fine until about a month ago when in the middle of a conversation she stopped responding to my texts, but was reading all of my messages. At first i thought she was messing with me like we always do with each other, but after a couple of days I started to get confused and asked her why she wasn't responding to my messages, again she left me on read. Not long after, she made a post on instagram somewhere along the lines of people not getting the hint that she didn't want to talk. This is when i really began to worry, I panicked and sent a **lot** messages asking what was wrong and if she was ok, again left on read. A couple days passed and she made another instagram post which said that nobody asked how she was doing and meant it anymore, under which I commented ""..."". Her response, still in the comments, was that spamming her DMs did not show that I cared (which she couldn't be more wrong about) and that I only spoke to her as a last resort when I was bored. I then responded by messaging her that she was anything but a last resort and that I cared about her only to be left on read again. She then made a third and final post on instagram directed towards me saying to stop messaging her. I was really hurt by this but wanted to respect her wishes, so I sent her one last massage. I told her that I was sad that she didn't want to be my friend but its ok and that I would be there if she ever wanted to talk, and that I would miss her. I also apologized for possibly inadvertently making her feel like a last resort. One last time she left me on read. Where do I go from here?",romance

"There are no rules so I don't know if I am allowed to do this, but I needed a vent.

Here we go




""Yes or no,"" he whispered softly as his hands swept across my jaw to hold my chin in place, forcing me to look at him.

Yes, yes, yes, yes!

The tension was palpable and our eye contact didn't break for what felt like hours. His fingers stroked my jaw.

He pulled me forward and kissed me. My hands immediately reached up to the back of his neck to play with his hair. I was insecure and nervous because I hadn't had much experience, which he noticed and made him chuckle. Our kiss deepened and became passionate, heated.
Our hands became nimble and started to caress each other, causing moans and pants.

I swallowed and blinked away the sudden fantasy. He was still holding my jaw, patiently looking into my eyes. I looked away from him and his hand fell. He sighed slightly.

""You know it takes forty minutes to drive you home."" He smiles slightly. ""Don't you think we should start going?""

I shrugged and fiddled with the hem of my sweatshirt. ""Probably.""

I could feel him looking at me. I smiled slyly and said ""I am seriously tempted to wait and answer after you start driving.""

He laughs and rolls his eyes ""Well then I'd have to stop the car!""

I laugh, smiling fondly as I look at him. He has the begining of a beard and extreamly curly hair, both a light shade of brown. His eyes were a calm, soft blue. Like the ocean, just after the sun rises.

""What?"" He asked softly. I shrugged, again, with a small smile.

""I like your face.""

He chuckled and looked ahead, above his steering wheel. He put one of his hands on it, turning away from me slightly.

""Can you guess?"" I asked shyly, looking at him sideways.

""Can I guess what?""

""What my answer would be.""

He looked at me, thinking.
""In the moment?"" He gave me a hungry glance before looking back to the mountains ahead. ""I think the answer was yes.""

I smiled softly and looked toward those same mountains.

I noticed movement and he put his hand in front of me.
I looked between him and his hand.
""What?""

He laughed, ""Do you want to hold hands?""

I smiled and interlaced our fingers. We sat in a comfortable silence, when he chortled.

""Its kind of difficult to drive shift holding hands like this.""

""Oh,"" I realized, letting go. He smiled softly.

""That's why you put your hand on mine."" He set his hand down and I chuckled softly. I once again interlaced my fingers with his. He turned on his car as I started up the music. We drove for a few minutes before I laughed.

""Trev?"" I asked.

He looked over at me, quizzical.

""The answer is yes.""

He laughed, ""I fucking knew it.""",romance

"So there’s this guy from my old school, we never really talked or anything but we recently saw each other and we started texting.

He drops all these hints like telling me I’m cute, saying he thinks about me and all those stuff. We were never really friends before—just classmates. But since we started texting we just got much closer and tbh I think I’m starting to fall for him.

There was this one incident where he made our friends believe we were dating or smth when they asked him cuz he just avoided the question (he told me this himself btw). And when I act shocked he just questions me and asks why I am so shocked since we were dating, weren’t we? This of course leads me into panic mode but then he just brushes it off and say he’s joking.

There are a couple of other similar incidents to this one that just makes my heart race. He knows things abt me when I never even noticed him much back when I hadn’t moved.

But then... he hasn’t texted me for a month so I’m thinking maybe he was just toying with me? Suddenly he just goes quiet and doesn’t talk to me again which just sucks cuz I was just starting to believe we were going somewhere.

I guess life just sucks this way. Feelings suck when they’re being played with 😤😤",romance

"... I didn't like running to catch my train, but if I would have walked as casually as I do I would have missed it and I'd have to wait half an hour for the next to train to arrive.

I spurted, didn't take the escalator, people would be standing left and right there anyway. Heading straight towards the stairs, I took two steps at a time, overtaking casual other commuters.

Finally, trying to catch my breathe, I reached the train station upstairs, thankfully my train didn't arrive yet, I still had like 2 minutes on the clock. As I was walking along the station, figuring out if I want to sit in the front or back side of the train I spotted a woman. She had brown long jacket and stylish handbags, I think it was one of those designer handbags, probably the expensive ones. Since as a male I don't have much experience with handbags, I could only guess. I look at her, she had long blonde-brunette-ish hair, she looked in my direction as well. I realized that I actually know her. Yes, it was her, it must be her! The girl I knew from school. It's been so long. I smiled instantly as I was looking in her direction.

I was so confused, couldn't believe that it was her, I stood awkwardly there, as I saw almost no reaction from her side, at best a surprise, I was frozen. I turned a bit so that I wasn' t facing her directly... my thoughts running, desperately trying to figure out if it is really her and how I could approach her.

As I was standing there trying to figure out a way to talk to her and elderly woman probably asked her a question, she answered her and moved towards the stairs and went down.

I was frozen, shocked, surprised.... and confused.

I decided to talk to her, I went downstairs as well but I couldn't see her anywhere.

I wanted to talk to her so much, would have liked to know what she is doing nowadays and how she is... I think it would have been nice....

I decided to run into the McDonald's nearby maybe she was buying something there while waiting for her next train... she was nowhere to be found.

I was sad, and probably looked crazy for the other people around me. I walked upstairs again, my train arrived and I went home, thinking about her and wishing to have taken initiative.

What could have happened? If she doesn't like me anymore she could have let me know and I'd let her be..... there I am left with my thoughts.... with my thoughts about her.

In a last attempt I walked through the whole train in the hope of meeting her. I didn't found her. As I came closer to my final destination I was getting mad at myself for not taking the initiative, for being a coward, for being so awkward, ughhhh!

As I turned my head one last time, I spotted someone else, my mood instantly switched. Although we talked for like 30 seconds it was quite pleasant, I hope it was pleasant for her too, at least she said so, I wish I meet her again.",romance
"This story is a bit lengthy! However if you’re a romantic like me, it’s worth the read ☺️

About a month ago, I met a guy while in Florida for a conference. I traveled with a big group if people from my school. We were out at a club on a Thursday night, and he just caught my eye. We will call him Michael. I thought he was very good looking, y’all, and he smelled amazing. So I purposely bumped into him, flirted a little and told him my name. I’m not a shy girl, but I never make the first move. Something told me I would regret not shooting my shot. 

So I did! And he was into me too! We danced all night, and he got my number. I left with my friends before he did, but we texted all the next day. He drove from his nearby campus by himself to meet me the next night at another club. Again, we danced all night and closed down the club. He had parked by my hotel, so we walked back together. I stalled until all the people from my conference had trickled back to the hotel, and then we decided to go to McDonalds. We got some food, and then parked so we could talk and listen to music. He played his music, and was dancing and singing to me in his extremely off key voice! I loved it, he was so adorable. We were looking into each others eyes, kissing... we could not keep our hands off each other. It was intense. He just made my heart melt and my knees weak.. I couldn’t resist him. So at around 3:30 AM, I went with him to his dorm. 

So, I am an adult, and I attended the conference with my peers. There is no rule against staying the night someplace else, but it’s also kinda frowned upon. So my hope was to get back before anybody in my room woke up. At around 6 AM, I got back and unfortunately there were people I knew in the lobby already up for the day. I had to duck into the little elevator area so hopefully nobody would witness my walk of shame. Despite the potential embarrassment, I was so happy. Michael made me feel giddy, and he was so fun to be with. 

So it’s Saturday now. And I had to spend the day with the group I came with. We had our last big dinner event that night, and after that I was free to do what I pleased. After the dinner, the 300 some people at the conference were all going to be going out. The biggest night for it. Yet, all I wanted to do was spend time with Michael. I decided instead to go to his dorm, and we cuddled and watched Netflix that night. 

Never in my life have I had such an instant Chemistry and connection with anybody before Michael. I dated somebody for 2.5 years who never made me feel that way. That night, we didn’t just sleep together. We made love. It was so pure and good. I will always remember it. 

My flight left Sunday evening, so all we had left was the day together before my flight back to Michigan. He drove me back to my hotel, and came inside with me to get my luggage. I saw many people from the conference, but I didn’t care this time. 

That last day we spent together was nearly perfect. We got breakfast at a diner, and then walked on the beach along the ocean for 2 hours. We held hands, collected shells, and took pictures together. Then we went to some shops, got smoothies, and headed back to his dorm. I didn’t want the day to end. He didn’t have to , but he said he would drive me to the airport. 

We cuddled together on his small dorm bed, and it was so nice. But then we looked at the time, and we realized we only had about an hour left together. As I laid my head on his chest, I couldn’t seem to fight the tears. But when I looked up at him, I realized that he was crying too. 

I watched this man cry, because he didn’t want me to leave. He said he never felt such strong feelings for a girl he’d only know for 3 days. We both agreed that we did not want it to end, and that we would keep in touch. He drove me to the airport, we said our somber goodbyes, and I got on the plane. My heart was broken. 

It’s been a month now, and we still text, Snapchat, call, or FaceTime every single day. I’ve never believed in love at first sight, but Michael was pretty damn close. I can’t say what will happen in the future, but life’s far too short to not believe in love ❤️",romance

## 📷

Hello,  I am reaching out to this group in hopes that someone might  recall the  plot snippets I have listed below of a possible historical Romance  story I once read a long time ago. Unfortunately, I no longer know the   title or the author and what little bit I do recall is not a lot.   Romance paperback possible from the 80s, as I started reading Gothic and   then the bodice rippers at that time.

&amp;#x200B;

What I most recall of the story  ...

1. heroine  (virgin): approx. age of 18 to early 20s who liked to take walks  along  the cliffs that were behind her families estate and that of the   neighbor's house, that was adjacent to the estate. Her family was   friends of the people who lived in that house. I believe the grandfather   still lives there and his grandson comes an visits him and to see the   heroine (who the young man loves).
2. Strong  Male Hero: Probably  in his 30s who may be her guardian and he has  inherited the estate  somehow; he maybe seeking a wife and i believe he  finds our heroine  attractive but he may feel she is too young.

Situation I  
The   male Hero becomes ill (not sure why) and our Heroine is nursing him   during the evening in order for the housekeeper to get her rest and   during one of her night watches with our Hero, he was out of mind with a   fever and as she was caring for him, he grabbed her and she ends up in   his bed and being pinned under him, he has his way with her and takes   her virginity. As it started out as a rape, I believe the heroine ended   up being a participant in the act and that is what the master is   troubled by of thoughts of a passionate encounter.

* After  that  incident, the Heroine must have covered it up so that the staff  would  not be aware the next morning and she does not say anything about  the  episode when a staff member arrives that morning after;
* When  the  hero/master does recovers from his illness, he is nagged by a  sense of  something did happen and needs to find the person who was in  his room  that night;
* He does not believe it was a dream as it seemed too passionate and real to him to be anything but what really happened;

Situation 2  
Not   sure why the heroine goes to the neighboring home of the grandfather   and the young man, but she does. The young man tells her he loves her   and wants to marry her, but she does not love him. she may agree to   marry this young man just to have a home.

* Our  hero/master does go  in search of her at the neighbor’s home (don't  believe he knows it was  here in his bed that night) he may be asking  why she ran away and asking  her to return to the estate. he returns to  the estate without her.
* She   does go back to the estate and it maybe that she feels he may not  think  of her as anything other than a child but she loves him and wants  to be  near him and to run the house is better than not being near him.
* However,   sometime after she returns to the estate, the hero does learn it was   her that night in his bed when he was delirious with fever and he seeks   her out in the dining room where she is doing some work. and he   confesses his love for her and happy ending.

**Situation III**

* ·  The Heroine does return back to the estate and I feel as though the she  is pregnant. \[I do not know if she tells anyone or if the housekeeper  finds evidence that the heroine was the woman in the bed\]
* ·  I do recall a scene where the heroine is in the dining room and maybe  going through the estates china for cleaning or for getting ready for a  dinner, but the hero does seek her in this room and confronts her as I  believe at this point the hero knows that it was our heroine that was  the woman in his bed.  \[do not recall how he finds out, but he does\]
* ·  I feel as though it is during this dining room scene that the Hero  declares his feelings for the Heroine and she does the same towards him.  \[I believe he asks her to marry him and she accepts his proposal. I  believe this is how the story ends\]",romance
Has your brother ever inviting a large group of boys over for a sleepover and one of them snuck into your room to do/say something adorable or cute?,romance
"I’m 13 and female. I read a lot of fiction books and fanfictions that mostly involves explicit sex. I don’t know why I read them but I do. And leads me to wonder things about being in a relationship with someone and experiencing....things.

My friends right now have already had their first kiss with boys (or girls). Some even got hickeys. And some do some dirty dirty things. And sometimes I can’t help feel kind of envious. I know it’s stupid, but I can’t help but think: what if a boy did kiss me? What is it like to have someone like you? 

Then it leads me to think that maybe I’m not good enough for these boys and that I’m ugly. Thoughts saying: you’re fat. You’re not skinny enough. What’s with the acne? Maybe they’d like you if you had an ass. My self esteem is already low and with that, it’s adding more pain.

Maybe the fanfics and books have gotten to my head that I’m living in this fantasy of falling in love and being with that person forever. 

All I know is, I’m a curious child. I’m envious of friends sometimes because they have something I don’t. I’m too “innocent” to understand. I have to stay in my shell while they roam freely. 

I want to experience romance. Or maybe not that. I want to experience the things kids today do and see what’s it’s like.

I’m a curious child. 

If you made it this far, congratulations 👏🏾",romance
"I’m not the type to do this, nor am I the type of person to continue to pursue someone after breaking it off. But, I fell hard for someone I was dating for 4 months. I know it isn’t much time, I’m surprised I even fell this hard for her but long story short:

These 4 months were great. We really clicked, we constantly texted throughout the day and even held multiple conversations at once on other apps (we would always share memes, posts and videos). 

We became really close, we both are busy individuals so we saw each other on the weekends. We would go out to eat and visit many places together. We had many amazing dates and everything was going perfect. We really got to know each other. Till this day, we know each other really well. 

We shared with each other our past dating life and experiences with one another. There was a special connection between us that we both identified. We would hang out, watch movies, cuddle and sleep over. In general, things were perfect and we became intimate after some time. We shared amazing moments in bed, we would always discuss how great it was

Everything went well, except for some small moments where we clashed. It was only three times. Each time was because I overreacted in a situation that didn’t make things better. I have a bit of a temper, but nothing ever got out of hand. I said some things that only made the situation worse but nothing too crazy. Each time we got over it and moved on. 

But after the third time, which happened through text, she told me to leave her alone and ignored me for 3 days. I apologized and gave her space in hopes of making things better. On the third day, I decided to send her roses with a special note attached which she received and then contacted me. 

They were really nice “luxury roses” which were expensive but the price didn’t matter to me. She told me how much she loved them and appreciate them ( to this day she sends me pictures of how the roses are blooming). But she told me afterwards that she would rather be friends instead because of my temper. It’s something she doesn’t want to deal with in the future and she believed it would continue to be a cycle that she doesn’t want to deal with. 

I understand her position, given her last history with guys who really hurt her. Learning from her last experience, I tried to be the opposite of the guys she’s told me she’s been with. My temper really messed this up. After the second time, I started taking anger management classes which was something I never told her about because I thought at the time it was embarrassing. But that’s how far I went to maintain the relationship we had. We never established a formal relationship, but we agreed to terms of only seeing each other and not talking to other parole. Which worked out well the entire time. 

It’s been a few weeks since we broke it off, and we’ve continued to talk and remain friends this entire time. We still text constantly, and the conversations are still great because we are very compatible. We’ve seen each other a few times too since then. We still go out to eat and go to the movies together since we’re both movie junkies. 

Sometimes we discuss what happened from time to time. She tells me how she doesn’t want to keep it going because she feels it’s going to happen again. And she doesn’t want to deal with it anymore even though she still has feelings about me. I revealed to her that I have been seeking help fixing my temper. I’ve made big improvements but I can’t seem to win her back.

I’ve dated many women in my life, but I never fell for anyone like this. She consumes my thoughts, there’s nothing more I want in the would then to have things back they way they were. I fell head over heals for this girl. 

What could I do to win her back? I feels like there’s something I need to do, trying to sweet talk her back isn’t going to do the trick. I know how she is. What makes the situation easier is that we are still on good terms, I’m texting her as we speak. But I really need to win her back!",romance

Dear Romance Readers: I am in need of your help in find a the below romance story ...

I was introduced to Gothic Romance genre after visiting a local book resell shop sometime around 1980. However, I did purchase Romance paperbacks such as Harlequin, Silhouette, etc. Unfortunately, I no longer recall the author or the title of this romance story that I am hoping to come across again and hoping that the below info will jog another romance readers memory of the book or provide possible suggestions. During my search for this romance book, I have come across great authors, such as Woodiwiss, Lindsay, Holm, Cookson, etc.

**\*\*\*\*\*\***

**Story Setting:**

* · Along a coast and the story references the heroine walks along her estate and neighbors cliffs\*;
* · Not sure if story takes place in England or along the eastern coastline of America

**Heroine (virgin age 18 to early 20s)**

* · The story starts shortly after the Heroine's father has passed away and she and the staff are expecting a new ""Master"" owner to her families' estate.
* · Heroine no longer has any living family members and is at the mercy of the new owner or new Master in this case.
* · Heroine does stay on living at her families former estate with the new Master and keeps her same bedroom;
* · I believe she is lonely and I believe the story references her seeking solitude in her bedroom.
* · I believe she feels useless and of no importance.
* · I also believe that the new owner is entertaining\*\* and she either is not part of the parties or she escapes to her bedroom during the parties.
* · Takes walks along the back of her families estate and that of the neighbor's home\*;
* · A male childhood friend who lives with \[I believe\] his grandfather
* · I believe she does find the new Master handsome and may have budding feelings towards him, but the new Master may see her as a child and may even treat her that way.

**Hero (maybe late 20s to mid-30s)**

* · Alpha male figure or strong character who knows what he wants;
* · I feel as though our hero is referred to as ""Master"" and runs the estate as master of his domain;
* · Do not recall how he obtained her families estate (not sure if it is a distant relative or if our hero purchased the estate);
* · I believe the hero shows indifference towards our heroine when he first meeting and does find her attractive, but he may feel she is too young for his purposes of a mate. (he may be
* · He may be searching for a wife who would fulfill his new status, but not looking for a love match
* · I feel as though he was entertaining families who have eligible daughters (or these families were pushing their daughters on him due to his title and status)
* · He may be looking for a wife that would fit his new status (good hostess and produce an heir for him)
* · I feel that with all the entertaining that he is doing that our Heroine retreats to her room for solitude or she may not be included to partake in the parties he hosts.

**Supporting characters**:

* · Grandfather: who lives in the house adjacent to the estate and is an old friend of her family. \[I believe he is survived by his late wife\]
* · Your male figure in this story is his grandson\*
* · \*Young Male Figure: who is referred to as the Heroine's childhood friend and is either living with his grandfather in this house or visits him often.
* · This young man loves our heroine and will confess his feelings to her at some point in the story; however, our heroine does not reciprocate his feelings and thinks of him only as a friend.
* · The grandfather and the young man are special to our heroine as her only source of family.
* · Estate Housekeeper: may have been with the heroine since her birth and cared for her whole life.

**Little Bits I recall of the Story:**

* · I feel as though when our Heroine \[and staff\] met the new ""master/owner"" of her families estate, she greeted him at the top of the stairs to the estate or this may have happened later on in the story when he arrived back home \[not sure\]
* · I believe that the male childhood friend of our Heroine does not like the Master and I believe it would be due to the fact that the young man has feelings for her. And the two male figures could have words said between them, as well as the Master making a reference to the heroine about the young man.

**Situation I**

* · The master has fallen sick \[not sure of the illness\], but he has a very high fever and I believe the housekeep and/or staff has been taking care of him and they are exhausted;
* · This is when our lonely heroine steps in and volunteers to sit through the night with the master (hero) and as the heroine is nursing him \[and may have reached over him\] as he laid on the bed in his fever state, he reaches up and grabs her and pins heroine on the bed underneath him and proceeds to ""make love"" to her. \[I am sure our heroine tries to free herself but to no avail\] and the master (hero) takes her virginity.
* · I believe it started out as a rape for the heroine, but I believe she savors this opportunity of discovering passion from a man \[or even this man as she has feelings for him\] as a result, this act ends up being a very heated encounter between the two.
* · The next morning, as I recall, the housekeeper is at the master's room in order to take over the vigil. I do not believe that the young woman says anything to the housekeeper or any of the staff about the sex scene that had occurred during his vigil with the master and she may have even cleared away any evidence of her losing her virginity to him.
* · However, not completely certain if she had and he may have discovered the evidence when he recovered from his illness (fever state).
* · I do recall that the master kept asking if the housekeeper/staff if there had been a woman in his room during his illness (fever state) and was told that there was not anyone other them the staff and the heroine.
* · I wish I could recall if the hero did have a woman he was dating or a potential wife, as he would have been asking if she had been in his room \[someone other than a virgin\] as I do not believe that he lets himself believe at this point in the story that it would have been our heroine in his bed that night.
* · However, when the hero does recover from his illness, he is troubled by nagging thoughts that what had happened that night with our Heroine; however, he doesn't know that it was her \[at this point in the story\] was not just a ""vivid"" dream, but it had to have really occurred.
* · As a result, he is trying to find out who had been in his room that night in order to find this woman;
* · He is told that no one other than servants and heroine had cared for him.
* · He may be seeing someone in this story; however, I do not recall
* · I feel as though he dismisses the thought that it would have been our heroine that had shared his bed that night.
* · At some point in the story, the Hero does find out that it was our Heroine who was in his bed that night during his fevered state.

**Situation II**

* · Not sure why our heroine ran away from the master (estate), but the heroine goes to the home of the young man/grandfather.
* · It may have been due to a scheming woman who has designs on the master and wants our heroine out of the way and said something to our heroine to make her run off. \[such as, that the young woman is expecting a marriage offer and will make the Heroine's live hell\]
* · While the Heroine is staying at this home, the young man declares his feelings towards her and may even ask her to marry. I believe she does tell him that she does not love him, but may agree to marry him in order to have safety and a purpose in her life – care for his grandfather. \[the grandfather suspects that she does not feel the same towards his grandson\]
* · Hero does seek her at the grandfather's home \[not sure what how he felt after she had ran off and if he just shrugged it off or if he ended up learning something from a scheming other woman vuing for his attention and marriage\] I believe our hero is developing stronger feelings for our heroine and goes to talk to her.
* · Heroine does talk to the hero but not certain if she tells him at this time that she is attending to marry the young man.
* · I believe that our hero does tell her that if she returns to the estate that she will be given importance to the estate and that could be the running of the estate. \[I do not believe that he knows that it was her in his bed – but he does want her back at the estate\]
* · I feel as though the grandfather was in a next room and heard the conversation between the hero and heroine and may have heard the tender feelings she has for this man in her voice. At any rate, I do believe that the heroine seeks the grandfather's council and I believe it is him that persuades her to return to the estate with our hero. \[she does tell the grandson/young man that she will not be marrying him and that she is returning to the estate\]

**Situation III**

* · The Heroine does return back to the estate and I feel as though the she is pregnant. \[I do not know if she tells anyone or if the housekeeper finds evidence that the heroine was the woman in the bed\]
* · I do recall a scene where the heroine is in the dining room and maybe going through the estates china for cleaning or for getting ready for a dinner, but the hero does seek her in this room and confronts her as I believe at this point the hero knows that it was our heroine that was the woman in his bed. \[do not recall how he finds out, but he does\]
* · I feel as though it is during this dining room scene that the Hero declares his feelings for the Heroine and she does the same towards him. \[I believe he asks her to marry him and she accepts his proposal. I believe this is how the story ends\]",romance

"*A/N: Jesus my posts are always f-ing long Also sorry for not posting in a minute I've been depressed.*

Alas, here I have another post, but this one is *solely* dedicated to Sarge, by wonderful boyfriend of seven years and fuel for most of my Reddit posts. Someone recently PM/DMd me and asked  what the what the most wholesome thing he's ever done was. I replied ""I can only pick one?""

I decided to pick this one, since it's the closest one to the plot of an actual fairy tale.

**Some context:** I had an abusive childhood. My parents hated me, my brother was scornful (and the golden child, of course). My birthdays were as they are meant to be- but only when I was little. It was great: friends, cake, the usual. When I got older though, my birthday became a season of screaming and tears. I'd ask for 3 things, and when they couldn't even do *that*, I got upset. Of course they became livid whenever I expressed any form of disappointment. Example:

(Me): ""For my birthday, I only want three things. First, I want to get Chinese for dinner. I don't care where, I don't care how cheap, I just would like some Chinese. Second, I want to pick a movie to watch at night. Third, I want a new jacket- mine is busted."" (Because my brother may or may not have beat it up as a confidence surge.)

(Family): ""Well *we* want sushi (I HATE seafood), you like shitty movies, and we're not buying you another fucking jacket after you ruined the last one, you spoiled, selfish brat!""

Now especially as a *kid,* when people can't even care about a ""you-day,"" especially your *family*, it feels like no one cares at all. Eventually we stopped celebrating my birthday all together. I was thankful that I got to dodge the season of hatred, but the whole thing itself was depressing. When I finally moved out (hoped on a plan to the other side of the country to get as far away as FUCKING possible) at age 17 ish (I graduated early in my Junior year: see r/self post), I made it known to everyone around me that I did *NOT celebrate my birthday*.

My long-term friend from junior high who I reference a lot to, Luna, moved with me and I made her understand this. I made sure any new friends we met at university knew this- bam. I did not celebrate my birthday. I was dead serious when I explained it too. It wasn't like a 'Oh no, I don't need anything! Don't worry about me!' type of selfless attitude, it was just too hard. I wouldn't be able to do anything without feeling self-centered. I know, it sounds so dumb.

Fast forward to when I meet Sarge in France. I am 18. We have a long-distance relationship, and by the time he comes to the US, I am 19. When he asked when my birthday was, I wouldn't even tell him. That was actually one of our first fights. He kept insisting that he wanted to do something nice for me as my boyfriend and lover, but I refused to let him even know the date. ""NO- I'm being serious, Sarge. I *do not* celebrate my birthday, I do not *want* to celebrate my birthday, *will not* do anything for the sake of that day!""

Sarge: ""Look, I know you're selfless and hate putting yourself first, but this is literally ""you-day."" How do you think I will feel when you spoil me rotten and I can't do anything for you?""

Me: ""Whopdie-fucking-do. I honestly could not give less of a shit if we don't celebrate my birthday, it's not just me being selfless, okay?""

Etc.

Since it had been a few years since I actually celebrated my birthday, I actually forgot about it when I turned 20, on January 20th (I guess apparently that's a big-deal birthday, since it's called a ""star-birthday,"" or like if you turn 12 on the 12th or something).

I woke-up like any other day and when I walked into the kitchen, Sarge was making breakfast. I was really surprised -- I still had no idea that it was my birthday -- and happy. I still remember what he made: pancakes with butterscotch chips and syrup, waffles with maple syrup and whipped cream and strawberries, crispy bacon, and deviled eggs with paprika sprinkled on top. My favorite(s).

We exchanged good-morning hugs and kisses and I sat down. From being in a great mood, I was suddenly skeptical. ""You didn't do anything... Did you?""

""Huh?""

""You didn't break or loose anything?""

He laughed. He said there was no reason for making me breakfast, he just wanted to. I pushed any suspicions aside and smiled. We ate together and Sarge mentioned that he wasn't going into work today, that he was taking the day off. Once more I was suspicious. Unfortunately, because of my upbringing, I usually have trust issues/problems understanding that people do nice things just to be nice.

His words were loosely: ""Because I remembered how much I love you last night, and I want to just be in love with you today. No responsibilities, no strings attached. I think we should take a day like that every once in a while, live life fully, yes?""

I cracked a smile and all I could do was kiss him. ""You're perfect.""

""Probably, yes.""

Laughter.

When he said ""I just want to love you today,"" I had thought he probably intended just a whole day packed with sex, good food, and cuddling. I didn't expect for him to take me into town.

We went into all the little cute local shops that get a lots of tourists during holidays, but it wasn't very busy since it wasn't a holiday. We walked all day. We went to a thrift shop to look at all the wierd and fun things and we bought a couple things, but even when the day was over, we had two bags total. Not huge bags either. We didn't go on a shopping spree, it was mostly browsing but it was *perfect*. We went to lunch at a nice place, but it wasn't formal at all. I got a bowl of pasta and Sarge got a sandwich- we split them both. I loved it!

Then, before we went home, Sarge took us to watch the sunset from the pier. When we *did* go home, I was convinced that that was the whole day and completely content with it. But that wasn't all. We pulled up to the driveway and Sarge told me to ""bundle up.""

I looked to him and said, ""What?""

He gave me a cheeky grin, ""Just trust me. I haven't screwed up today yet, have I?""

So I went inside and put on some warmer clothes and a big cozy jacket. Sarge also put on his jacket, but it wasn't very big. I mean he's from Russia, so he doesn't really get too cold. That and the man is like a giant furnace. I swear you can hug him and he's always super warm, which is great for cuddles.

Anyway, we got Comrade in the back seat again and as it was night fall, Sarge began driving again. We listened to some music from the 80's or 90's or whatever like that and just drove for like an hour. I turned the music down at some point and asked, ""Okay... I know you just want to be nice but you know I have suspicions about people who be nice for no reason. Are you *sure* there isn't some holiday I missed? Like national... Couples' day? Or our anniversary- no, see that isn't even until summer!"" I couldn't figure it out.

""No, no. You didn't miss anything. You're so sweet and wonderful on a daily basis and I just wanted to say 'I love you.'"" He took one of his hands off the steering wheel and held my hand in my lap with it.

""Well damn- you could've just bought me a chocolate bar and I'd be all over you,"" I laughed.

He drove us out to the middle of forest, away from everything and everyone. He parked in a semi-cleared area and I asked ""What now?"" I wasn't sure if this was where the sex started or maybe just some making out or something completely wholesome...?

""Now..."" He opened his door and moved to get out, ""we can see the stars.""

""Seriously?"" I couldn't believe it. ""We just get to watch the stars!?"" I beamed. All the ride over there I had been commenting on the stars which we could finally see with no light pollution. ""I *love* you!!!""

We sat on the hood of the car but left Comrade inside so he wouldn't become a pupsicle (Ha ha. I'm sooooo funny.) and just laid back for a while. It was amazing. He had gotten some blankets that he stowed away in the back and a thermos of hot cocoa, but it was white chocolate instead of milk chocolate. Interesting. Really good. I wondered how in the hell he managed to pack everything while I just changed back at the house... Either I take longer to change than I thought or Sarge is secretly the Flash.

 We saw a few shooting stars, too. When we saw the first one, Sarge turned to me and asked, ""What did you wish for?""

""To never let today end.""

""Aww, but if it never ended, we wouldn't get to do anything different. Don't you want to take another day to go skydiving?""

""... MarRY mE.""

And more laughs. We had been there for a while and then Sarge said, ""Oh wait- there's something more.""

He hopped off the hood and went to open the car again. ""More? The hell- let me guess, do you have the Queen of Sheba in there?""

He brought back a basket of muffins, my favorites! There were pumpkin and then Lemon poppyseed. ""JESUS. Did you steal Mary Poppins's bag and hide it in the car!?"" I couldn't believe I didn't smell it on the way over.

""Maybe."" He has a very handsome smile.

He settled back in next to me and for the last time I was suspicious. All the kind gestures aside, I noticed the basket the muffins were in and the smell. ""... Wait a minute... Is that, is that Luna's basket? And her recipe?"" (Luna is my long-term best friend and partner in crime) ""Okay- I'm going to ask you one last time. I love you, I love you so much, and I know you love me too, but for the love of all things holy- *what* is going on today?""

He kept saying he just ""wanted to do something nice"" but I was thinking I had cancer or something and somehow didn't know and he did, which doesn't even make sense.

This time though, he didn't give that excuse. He didn't say anything. He took a single muffin from the basket, reached behind his back and pulled out a single candle and his lighter. I was *really* confused and in shock until he stuck the candle in the muffin, started his lighter, and softly began singing ""Happy Birthday"" while lighting the candle.

I tried to keep my crying quiet, but only partially succeeded. I had forgotten my own birthday. He went around me and bribed Luna for my birth date and a basket of her famous muffins. He set up an entire day of nothing insane, but everything right, meaningful, and leisurely. I guess Luna also explained to him *why* I didn't celebrate my birthday, that I hated the feeling of being a burden and that I was asking for too much since I had it in my head that asking for anything was asking too much (thanks, shitty childhood family). But throughout the day when he kept saying, ""just because I want to,"" not only did it keep me from feeling like a burden, but it made me feel like he genuinely cared. Like he didn't just look at the calendar, groan, and try to set something up... I knew he didn't. I knew he cared.

I wouldn't have expected to be so emotional but I also didn't expect black widows to eat their mates after sex yet here we are (a random off-topic fact brought to you by an ADD mind). After the candle went out, he just put the pastry aside and gave me the biggest bear hug. I don't think I've ever felt so loved in my life.

Since then, we've begun celebrating my birthday again. It's still not a huge affair, but Luna and her boyfriend are usually involved.

Speaking of Luna- when I saw her the next day I greeted her with ""Hey, *bitch*... No I'm not mad, I love you... Nah let's get food so I can tell you all about it!""",romance

"Hello, I am reaching out to this group in hopes that someone might recall the plot snippets I have listed below of a Gothic Romance book that I once read a long time ago. Unfortunately, I no longer know the title or the author.  This Gothic Romance book would be considered a bit out of date for today's society, but every once in a while I start to think about this story and I have been searching for some time in hopes of finding it to re-read it.  I stumbled upon Gothic Mystery Romance books when visiting a book resell shop towards the late 70s and I did pick up some Harlequin books, as well … not sure what this Trashy story may be classified as, but the following story snippets is what I recall.

**What I can remember of our heroine (virgin): approx. age of 18 to early 20s**

* · a young adult woman who lost her parents (mother probably at an early age), the story starts at the time of her father's death or son thereafter;
* · No male heir, the estate is either entailed to another relative or a complete stranger who has purchased the estate (wish I could remember betters):
* · Heroine is able to stay on and live in the families estate due to she is a relative or out of kindness from the new owner.
* · She is able to keep her bedroom in the estate and I feel as though she is ignored with not a lot to do.
* · I feel as though when she comes back to the estate after she ran away to the neighbors, she is given the role of running the home.
* · It may even turn out that she is pregnant.

**Male (strong) hero: Probably in his 30s (like most of these genre stories)**

* · New owner/master of the estate is an arrogant type of hero and not sure how he came to be the new master after the death of the heroine father;
* · Seems to be an angry man and may have had a bad relationship with another woman or may be forced to get married.
* · I feel as though the heroine and staff may have greeted the new master at the top of the steps, just outside the front door

**Setting:**  I am sure if it is in England or if it is along the eastern coastline in America, but I recall there was references made throughout the book that the heroine enjoyed walks along the cliffs and past the young man’s home (the neighbor to the estate)

**Supporting characters**:

* · A young man but a bit older than her lives next door with his aging father or maybe grandfather.
* · The young man loves our heroine, but she does not know until later;

**Bits I recall of the Plot:**

* · The male Hero becomes ill (not sure why) and our Heroine is nursing him during the evening in order for the housekeeper to get her rest and during one of her night watches with our Hero, he was out of mind with a fever and as she was caring for him, he grabbed her and she ends up in his bed and being pinned under him, he has his way with her and takes her virginity. As it started out as a rape, I believe the heroine ended up being a participant in the act and that is what the master is troubled by of thoughts of a passionate encounter.
* · After that incident, the Heroine must have covered it up so that the staff would not be aware the next morning and she does not say anything about the episode when a staff member arrives that morning after;
* · When the hero/master does recovers from his illness, he is nagged by a sense of something did happen and needs to find the person who was in his room that night;
* · He does not believe it was a dream as it seemed too passionate and real to him to be anything but what really happened;
* · At some point in the story, the master does find out that it was our Heroine who was in his bed that night. (not sure how he finds out and not sure if it has to do with why our heroine runs away, but she goes to the house of the young man);
* · While she is at the young man’s home, he confesses his love for her but she doesn’t feel the same towards him;
* · Our hero/master does go in search of her at the neighbor’s home and he may know that it was her or not until later in the story, but she does return to the estate;
* · I recall her being in the dining room with the housekeeper maybe getting ready for a party, but it maybe when the master confronts her about that night or maybe that she is pregnant and does the right thing by asking her to marry him.

The kicker is the kissing. I've heard stories online about how the first kiss says a lot about your compatibility and how there can be fireworks and all that. I always thought it was bullshit. I've loved my ex for years and never really had that. Kissing was always just okay. But with this girl. I just cant explain it. I was blown away entirely.

"Hello. I have a little problem at that moment that’s kind of eating away at me. I’m 13 and I know I’m extremely young to be thinking about romance or having love in my life. But there was a situation that happened a couple months that made me feel really happy. The happiness I’ve ever felt, and I thought that was strange but didn’t think too much of it. I was happy. 

So on this app called “Amino” there are tons of communities. One in particular had my favorite anime/manga so I joined it (in July of 2018). Fast forward to a couple months later (in January of 2019). I met this boy online that claimed he was 15. We started talking and became friends. We had a lot in common when it came to music and life. One day we played a game of +18 truth or dare with a couple of his friends. I dared him to kiss the person he likes online (a different girl), but suddenly he kissed me (online). I was confused, but happy. And I did the same. One thing lead to other and we were in a relationship. It lasted for about a couple weeks until....my dad heard me talking on phone with some of my friends from the app on a voice chat. He got mad and I was banned from ever going back on there again. But before that my mom did attempt to work through this with me but I was too stubborn and very rude. That was when my whole world just crashed. She said I’m never allowed to go back on there and I got my phone taken away from me for a month. I cried and told myself things will okay and if they see good in it then they would let me go back on there. But my hopes were crushed. Those unrealistic thoughts. A childish fantasy that was real and would never happen. 

I wanted to say goodbye to him. Talk to him one last time. I know it’s stupid and extremely immature but I don’t know. I cared about him. I just wished it stayed a bit more longer. 

I know there are dangers to the internet, but still, even after 2 months also 3, it hurts like hell. I just feel empty. 

But I know he’ll forget about me and move on to the next girl...

If you made this far, congratulations :)",romance

"Okay so, This is my first time using reddit (my friend suggested i post here for advice about my current...issue). 

So basically, my best friend of seven years, not the one who told me to post here, lets call her"" Jessie"", told me last year that she had feelings for me. At the time I didnt know how to respond because I felt the same but I felt guilty because I was in a relationship at the time so I remained quiet about it and never really said anything to her about it. Fast forward to last october, i ended the relationship i was in because it had turned unhealthy from my partners side. I gave myself time to get over my emotions from my break up and that following december, I confessed to Jessie and asked her out. She never answered me.

I never brought it up or asked her why because she seemed like she just wanted to pretend it never happened. Fast forward to now, and she is talking about when we are going to live together in the future (we are both currently in college) and how we can movie marathon and cuddle on the couch and all that, so I get my hopes up and ask her out again.

"I don't know this guy personally, but I've fancied him for a while, a few months. He is in my history class, I never seem to get to interact with him unless it's the beginning of class. I have only talked to him a few times about assignments. On Valentine's, I sent him an anonymous rose. He was happy to receive it. He seems such a gentleman, polite and charismatic. The problem is I haven't plucked up the courage to start a general conversation with him. I tend to stutter and stammer which isn't fun, I also feel like I'm not attractive. I'm a bit chubby, working to lose weight, I've got a ton of acne, hair grows out weirdly, and I'm not popular.  Theres nothing special about me. I know for a fact I'm not rude or loud, I sometimes speak but I feel as if I can't even befriend him due to this. My hygiene is good, no issues there. Do I say hello at random? I can only do that when I'm saying hi to one if my friends, if he were near that friend.. I would say hi to him as well. The year is ending and I feel like I don't have enough time. I try to avoid being socially awkward or shy. I am not super shy, but I'm not a happy medium. What is the best way to approach this situation if I am insecure about myself and afraid of screwing up?",romance
"I noticed there’s a lot of romance or romantic comedy movies about British men and American women falling in love, a great example is Nottinghill, and a lot of other Richard Curtis films.

"Okay, let's talk about our first kiss experience. This is mine :

My girlfriend came visiting. I had prepared dinner for us. The moment was fun filled, we laughed, played fun games, joked about stuffs, smiled at each other, eat then relaxed. The time came for her to leave, it was dark as there was a power failure in the area, so we made use of the torch on my phone, which was not very bright. 

The door entrance is higher than the floor of my room, I was on the entrance while waiting for her to fix up herself. While waiting she gave me a gum to chew, which I resisted, but she persisted. I didn't know what she was up to, sometimes I now feel that I was so dumb with respect to romantic seduction skills. So I took the gum and did chew it. 

She then approached the door and told me about the oil drop (from the food) on her top. I pointed the torch at the distance I was and couldn't find anything of such. She told me to draw closer. Note, she was still in the room, while I was at the door post, that means I was now ""taller"" than her, tho we were really of the same height.

Closer I went but still couldn't see anything. That's when she said I should bend, pointing to her breast region. In curiosity I bent and what I experienced happened at the speed of light:

	  while I  opened my mouth again to say "" I can't find anything...""  I felt her hand on the back of my neck, a pull towards her body , I felt a soft, slender object (that is her tongue) inside my mouth with a movement that created an irresistible sensation all thru my body and a soft lips on my mouth, I couldn't resist it, so I gave in.

Thereafter, she breathed a sigh of relief. ""That was amazing"" I replied, then went ahead to ask for more. Well, at the moment we're no more together. 

So now over to you. Let's hear yours. ",romance

"I have a weird situation where I live in the U.S. and I met a girl from Germany I care a lot about and would want to potentially get married to her. We need more time together, so I’m going to see her for 2-3 weeks this summer, but then what?
 She doesn’t want to go to school here because it costs so much more(i agree). I’m not sure if I would be able to move to Germany permanently, but I want to find a solution. I have a good job here selling insurance so I would be restarting if i moved, and I know next to no German(not sure that would matter). I think if I found a solid solution either one of us would make the move to one country or the other. It just would need to make enough sense meaning i don’t want her to sacrifice her pursuits for me alone. I just know that I can’t handle long distance for years i think.

"I expect to hear your positive thoughts about the other sex in the hope that this might cheer up our days a little bit.

Personally, I have always found women to be very interesting. Women are just different from men. Women are mysterious. Women can bring excitement. Women can light up the day. Women are in some way mythical. It's really difficult for me describe what exactly I find interesting. For example talking about a specific with a man feels different to me than talking about the same topic with a woman. I tried to neutralize this as much as I could but I think I actually don't want to. I want to feel that over excitement when talking to that one specific woman. I want to feel that overjoy when talking to that special someone.  I want all of that emotions. I don't want to neutralize my emotions but I also don't want to share all my emotions with everyone, some emotions are meant for only one person to witness. :) 

There is... there is something like a spark you feel when both of you like each other. It's just something different. I cannot describe it.

Even if we didn't really experience it, like me (being single) we still are able to fantasize and dream about such sparkly moments, about feeling safe by being close to each other physically or mentally. ",romance

"Im an eighth grader who is a first chair flutist. For the past few months until last Sunday (day of the concert), the band has been practicing a few songs that will be played in a concert. The concert will involve 3 other lutheran schools (not a competition), and we (including those other schools) will unite as one and play the exact pieces we’ve been practicing. Two days before the concert, the other schools met at our school to rehearse and get used to how it will be like when we are united. The band teacher that conducted and taught us and the other schools assigned each student/individual to their seats. I looked around who i was sitting by. Because another school had another eighth grade first chair flutist, we had to share first chair (without actually using one chair obviously). That girl that i had to share first chair with was so STUNNING. Shoulder length blonde hair, soft-spoken, and quiet just like me. She even managed to start some nice conversations between us. On the day of the concert, of course everyone had to wear something nice or an aloha shirt. When i saw her again, her looks and my affection for her went from 9/10 to 20/10. This is because of her nerdy ray-ban glasses she actually uses on a daily basis, her dress, and her undone hair. This time we sparked even more conversations between us. She even started asking questions abt me and told me wut songs she sang when the choir was singing. Then, she talked abt her favorite parts of the music and which pieces were her favorite to rehearse and play, and judged how the flutist, that was accompanied with the piano for choir, was playing. I asked her if this was her last year. She replied, “yea, this is my last year and then im off to high school. I wouldnt have to wear the same weird uniform my school requires anymore after.” I said, “Oh, ok.” I asked her wut school she applied to. She replied with “I didnt apply to any school because im not going to private school anymore! Yaaayy!!” She laughed very hard in a quiet manner and i was laughing too while face palming. I promised myself to play and practice a hard flute piece that i started practicing WAYYY BEFORE all of this happened. I even told myself to practice it during regular band classes, the rehearsal, and the concert without making sound. The girl saw me pull out the piece and place it on the music stand we were sharing (this was when the choir was singing and the band was taking a break/intermission. The choir was on risers that was placed in front of the entire band section and the audience really coyldnt see us at all). While i was quietly practicing, she had a surprised and impressed look on her face and was like “my gosh this is hard. Why and how is he playing this?!” This is a story of me having love at first sight to another blonde girl flutist from another school. ",romance

"(Titles are hard don’t judge me.)

So I’m currently HARDCORE crushing on this girl. Normal stuff, think about her often, (but not exclusively) or anything like “I’d die for my queen and I will protect her” yada yada. Just, I feel a true and genuine connection with her. Here’s the kicker.

She feels the same way.

My brain goes into panic mode. Surely there’s a “but” coming, right? This is too good to be true. Then it hits. She says that while she feels the same about me, she isn’t in the best place right now to be in a relationship and said that even though we’re attracted to eachother, it may be better if we stay “good friends”.

Okay, I can respect that. Over text it’s not the most incredible conversations, and she’s expressed her opinions on PDA and such (mostly negative). However, in private, she wraps herself around my arm, leans on me, kisses my cheek, and so on. 

I haven’t known her for long enough to call it “love”. More so affection. I don’t just want some cheap fling with whatever “hot chick” I can score. I want a truly fulfilling relationship with her, to spend days, weeks, months talking about our favorite shows, music, our lives, and to just be with her. Even past girlfriends have really stuck around because I didn’t want to break up with them, but it’s not like I was invested in the relationships. She’s said she doesn’t want one and I have no problem with that. Even as friends, I still want to spend time with her. 

The only problem is that our time together is limited. Come summer I’ll have to return home and I don’t know that either of us want to try and keep a long distance relationship. In that time I’m trying my hardest to spend as much time as I can now, and I know I’ll see her again. We’ve already made lots of plans. 

It’s a weird feeling knowing that she feels the same but that we just can’t make that happen right now. At the end of the day, to everyone else we’re good friends who just happen to like eachother, but to her, I mean a lot more.

And she means a lot to me.



Am I on the right path here? I would never force her into something she didn’t want, so when I say the “right path” I refer to just what the ideal choices are for me, not necessarily how to ‘make’ her ready.",romance

"I met him 4 years ago. Met him at my workplace. I was a messed. Had family issues. He invited me over to his place. I lost my virginity to him. We slept 1 more time after that then we lost contact. I dont remember how we lost contact. I even forgot about him. 


Then, he found me. After 4 years. Claiming he ""lost but not forgotten"" me. He said he went back to my work looking for me but I left shortly after we stopped our connection. 

He invited me on a date. Try things out between us. Since we never really had a chance. I initially said yes but changed my mind as for me past is past. No need to bring it to my present.

Then he makes his argument about my way of thinking. I thought about it. Then, agreed to meet him. I won't deny that I was also horny that time. He knows about it that as much as possible I dont want to sleep with him yet but I will likely do. I cant keep my mouth shut. 

We slept together. He assured me it doesnt matter if I sleep with him first date or not. I can do whatever I want. Be real to him.

We saw each other couple more times. I always sleep at his place and he always cuddles with me. Then, I realized I'm starting to like him.

I talked to him about us. Well, I told him I was scared of him because he's good.. too good to be true. Then, we talked. 

Here is some of the excerpt of our convo:

He said he's not good but he was glad I feel that way towards him. Then,

Him: apparently im a fuccboi at least thats what women keep telling me

Me: Is that what you are or what people labelled you?

Him: i dont really do well with commitment i'll be honest. i have bad  history of that

Me: so you dont like commitment?

Him: Not really its too much weight at least rn but ur super chill thats why i havent freaked out i think but i dont want to hurt you at the same time 

blah blah then,

Him: I'm glad you feel that way. I like you too but I just dont want to break your heart if you develop feelings for me. I still want to habg out with you tho but I need to make sure you wont have expectations. Also I need a small break, like 2 weeks to deal with personal issue rn. If you are okay with that we can be good friends as long as emotionally you dont set up disappointment for yourself. You know what I mean?

Me: yeah no problem 

Then I asked him if he is still with his ex. Or anyone exclusively. He said no that they broke up but they talk from time to time.

I told him I would appreciate it if he tells me oncw they get back together or even sleep together since I dont want to cross that line AND we are sleeping with no protection. I know. Bad idea but we both clean tested and all. 

He responded with, ""we can be friends.i'll be honest then you can choose if you dont want to sleep with me"" 

He continued,

""i've had probs with her but she is still bit in my life  tbh but i dont want to lose you coz i havent figured it out yet so id like us to be friends if thats not awkward to you""

Me: So you still have feelings for her and still figuring things out with her but you like me as a friend

Him: I like you as a person



I decided to give him the space and time he is asking. I'm stupid I know. But, I'll take a risk even if I know my chances are not good. That he will ghost me. 100% chances he will definitely ghost me. 

At the end of the convo, he sent me heart emoji. I told him I will let him lead. Let him decide. I dont want to force myself to someone. If he ghosts me, then I move on. If he comes back in 2 weeks, decided that he will be with his ex then kudos to him. For the bravery. For keeping his word. If he comes back in 2 weeks and choose me, well.

"
Love is something everyone wants and desires. It’s something that we all crave. We all wish to feel loved and to be in love with someone. Love can be described in different ways. There is the way you love your mom or dad. They brought you into this world and would go through anything to protect you. There is the love you feel for a sibling. You would protect them no matter what. Yes, they annoy you and yes you pick on them but you’ll be damned if anyone else does. There’s the love you fee for the rest of your family. They’re your family and no matter how dysfunctional or crazy they will always be your family. Then there’s your friends. You love them like your siblings. You sometimes wish they were your siblings. Then there is the love I’m talking about. Whenever you are this person you smile and get instantly happy. They bring butterflies in your stomach and make you feel okay, even if it is momentarily. They can do no wrong in your eyes. They’re magnificent and beautiful. Love is a weird thing. Love makes you loose all your sense of time and other emotions. You’re trapped in one vision where everything is okay. Love is precious and beautiful. I love, love. You can love someone for their looks. You can love them for their personality, how they make you feel, how they treat you. You can love someone because they’re all of the above. However love can be dark. When you love someone who you knows will never love you it hurts, it eats away at you. You have false hope that maybe one day, but you know it’s not going to happen. You just wish you could be given a chance or be seen in a different light. You just wish you’d be returned with the love you feel. Love is weird and precious. Don’t let it slip away if you can help it. What should you do when the person you’re in love with likes someone who is in love with someone else? Keep your mouth shut and pretend things are fine. Keep smiling because they’re happy and beautiful. They’re happy and you are too because they are... you don’t want to ruin it. Be good to them because they’ve been good to you. Keep it together. Don’t let then get sad again. You love them. ",romance

He would have treated her like trash. He would have been nice at first and then continued to play with her feelings. That's the kind of guy he is. He uses people for personal gain.

The more I look at her the more I feel like I am about to melt. Without any words spoken, we start walking. Feeling the grass under our bare feet and inbetween our toes. It's a slightly ticklish feeling, yet their softness makes it very comfortable to walk through them. 

We reach a quite warm area and stop there. I turn around, facing her with my while body. She smiles and turns around as well. We reach for each others free hand. Our eyes are locked onto each other. I feel excited yet nervous and anxious. This is more than I expected and more than I can handle. I feel how my eyes fill up with tears. Tears of joy. I try to keep my smile up in the hope that she understands, that I am actually enjoying this. My heart seems to pound faster with each beat.

She let's go of my hands, they slip back to my side. I stay there, unable to say a word. She just stands there, looking into my eyes with a slight smile. Slowly yet determined she walks closer to me, lifting her hands up and forming them into a cup... I close my eyes... my eyes still being closed I feel her warm hands cupping my face.

I open my eyes, she stands right infront of me, our lips almost touching. Although it's warm and I am melting infront her, my body seems frozen, unable to move. A tear breaks out and runs down my cheek. I blink. Another tear runs down my other cheek.

Our eyes still locked onto each other.

As if the time is frozen.

No worries. 

No prejudices. 

No expectations. 

Just a man and a woman sharing an intense deep connection. ",romance

"Let me start this off, I am not a good guy. I like to think, that I am a pretty decent person, I go out of my way to help people, and I always will stand up for someone being wronged. I support people, and many times in my life women have misconstrued this as romantic intention. Most recently, one of my friends was in what she described as an extremely toxic relationship. I told her she deserved better, helped her find help. I should have backed off then, but I didnt. She was hurting, I spent time with her because she said she was lonely, and she felt it blossom into a relationship. I never did, and long story short, I broke her heart. At fhe time, I didn't think I was capable of love, let alone did I want to be in love. 
This is because a year earlier, i was in absolutely what I thought was the greatest relationship of my life. I wanted to marry this girl, she was everything I had ever wanted. I woke up every day with a smile on my face, because i knew I would see her, hear from her. 
Literally, the same day I was starting to look at engagement rings after me and her had talked about engagement, somethimg we both wanted, she called me after I get off work, broke up with me, joined the army, and left my life forever. 
I was blindsided, drank myself into oblivion and closed myself off from the world. In that time I lost two very close family members. It was absoloutely the lowest point of my life so far.

Now, in my last year of my degree, I started going to church again, and through the campus group from the church met possibly one of the most amazing people I have ever met. She from day one has always sat beside me whenever i see her, well into my personal space,- whispered in my ear, helped me find my way into the group. She invites me to things she knows I wouldn't go to otherwise. Shes sweet, innocent and friendly. She embodies everything I see as good and beautiful in the world. Shes a couple years behind me in school, and I'm staring down the barrel of a career that will drag me away from home very often in government service. 

I know, I am falling in love with this girl, because I feel like a damnned child around her. I feel light, i trust people, I let her in. But as good as it feels, i know I cant love her. She deserves someone that doesnt have this baggage I have, someone that shares her sunshiny disposition. Someone innocent like she is, that hasn't given their heart away before, that hasn't broken hearts like I have. She deserves something stable, and as good for her as she is for me. 

Im struggling with this, because selfishly, i want to believe this can work, when I know it can't. 

TLDR: I'm falling in love with a new friend in my life, that is wonderful and innocent and sweet. But god knows I don't deserve a moment of her attention and im terrified of hurting her.",romance
"I'm male, 21, single, bi, and about as inexperienced in love and romantic relationships as they come- at least I think so. I used to be a large part of the hookup culture, using such apps to substitute sex for genuine feelings and almost always ghosting people- which is something that now somewhat haunts me, but getting to the point- I'm very afraid of commitment, but am incredibly romantically lonely. Every time I find someone, I often end up becoming awkward and clingy. Too many times have I spoken too much and ended up spooking someone off, or even just ended up bailing if it got too intimate and sometimes even sexual. As it stands now, I've met many people I've liked and may have even wanted to be with, but haven't felt right entering real relationships with.

"Okay so I (25F) started talking to this man (26M) We have known each other for years; about 15, but we had not seen eachother since middle school until January of this year. Now that we are in each others life's where we can physically hang out I realized that I don't know much about him anymore. We would talk on the days of MySpace but that was so long ago. I already have a hard time being social with others because of my own past and insecurities. And now I realized that he is socially awkward as well.

Now what worries me is that we may not have anything to talk about. The way the world is now people are so glued to cell phones or tv and I fear that intelligence and enlightened conversations are just out the window.

Also. He is getting a divorce and I am still living with my ex for financial reasons. We have no money saved to move apart. But have agreed to no longer be in a relationship.

That being said. I truly fear that it would be best for me to be with my ex permanently because we have those enlightened conversations. The what if's about the world and theories. And we can talk for hours about seemingly nothing. Yet I do not love my ex. It is disheartening. Because the way I feel about my friend of 15 years is far different. I have always loved him just for who he is and his demeanor. And I do in fact look forward to us going on real dates and having those long talks. Am I just paranoid and over thinking it? My biggest fear is not having anything to say because my brain can be empty sometimes. That's what happens when someone does nothing but work, shit, eat and sleep. More than anything I don't want him to think I'm an idiot.

"i used to like someone when i was about 14. i liked him since i was 14 till 16, we were the same age. it was a painful yet innocent love story with many heartbreaks and tears. it took me about a year to get over him when we parted ways. 

fast forward to 2018, i was in a new school and i made new friends. one of friend was close to this friend (also in my class). me and the boy weren’t close until the end of 2018 when he invited me to a christmas party, together with the other friend. few days later, he invited me, the same friend and another female friend of mine to a carnival. some stuff happened afterwards, lots of drama happened. it was very childish and it involved him.

2019 came around and we’ve started hanging out more often with another group of friends, which still includes both my friend and my female friend. i’ve started to grow interest towards him and i think i’ve started to like him. but i’m scared of liking someone now, especially after the guy i liked for 2 years. 

i’ve also noticed that he always talks and tease with my female friend and i’m afraid that he likes her and she likes him. whenever i see them talking i get really jealous. i know i shouldn’t be but that’s just how i feel. i tell myself to get over this infatuation because my heart cannot handle this jealousy. but, he still treats me really nice and also cares about me (i think?) 

i’ve only like him for close to 2 months so i don’t want to confess or anything yet. i’m a real sucker for guys that care for me so maybe it’s just an infatuation.

now i just need advice on how i should get over him without making things awkward and still continue to be friends with him. ",romance
"So there is this girl I've known for 11 years (I'll call her Alice).
A month ago we told each other we love one another and kissed and stuff. It lasted 3 days and the break up was brought up by her. I understoon what she said and I said I was so happy she said it, casue I was like this once as well, and I totally get it. I guess you can say I also helped the break up. I had a feeling she isn't ready yet. I added: ""listen, if you don't feel ready yet, tell me, I'll totally get it"". So she did.
We continue being friends.
There are some times though, that we hold hands without anyone seeing (she mostly takes my hand and hold it). As an example, when we're at friends house, we'll sit close to one another on the sofa, and cover ourselves with the blanket and hold hands under the blanket.
Yet, there are times Alice ignore me, I guess you can say. For example, I can say: ""have a good one Alice!"" And she will answer: ""yeah yeah bye"" and rush off. It happen sometimes.

"First time posting on this subreddit and mobile poster, also Canadian. Also really bad at figuring out what information is unnecessary to provide.

So, I'm an 18-year old male, who has the sort of personality that somebody on a discord server I'm on describes as ""Mostly Dandere, but with a lot of deredere."" 

Basically, I've fallen for my best friend, whom I haven't seen in at least a year but we're still quite close. Not just best friend, we were each other's first friends. I first fell for her in elementary school, and she knew about it, and I actually felt heartbreak then, because she and my other best friend were together for a short time, and she friendzoned me as well, but we were such good friends that I accepted it. 

I still do, because I want to keep that friendship above all else, but that first infatuation started to go away in junior high when she changed to the other programme (French Immersion to English), and I had feelings for someone who was in my class for those two years of grades 7 and 8, but looking back on it now it was just an infatuation.

Fast forward to between grades 8 and 9, when she babysat my little sister in the summer (a sister who is only 4 years younger than us, but eh. I think part of it was so that it would be job experience for her, because she's a really good friend of the family as well), and she told me that she saw me as a brother to her. Note that this time I kept my feelings completely hidden.

Anyways, she switched schools right after the beginning of high school, and my feelings began to fade slightly, then they went away again partway through grade 10, when I fell for someone in the same programme as myself (International Baccalaureate). I actually first really took notice of her in geography for an assignment we were paired together to work on....

Anyways, I never had the courage for the entire time I had feelings for her (So grade 10 until graduation, basically. So grade 10 until 7 months ago.) And actually last October I learned that she is asexual, and apparently it was a commonly known thing? Also I had tried to be really obvious about my feelings for her, while also doing my best to hide them. Kind of got overshadowed by the fact that I'm already really polite, I feel like.

Anyways, I never ended up confessing, but I'm sure she knew although she never spoke to me about it. Other's knew for sure though. ANYWAYS, She-Who-Now-Currently-Unkowingly-Has-My-Heart-In-Her-Possession said that she would try to make it to my graduation ceremony (She couldn't; she got called in to work), and just the suggestion that we could spend some time together, well, we still haven't managed to meet up, but my feelings for her are very strong. Whenever I think of her I get this pleasant warm feeling in my chest.

We do text each other on occasion, and I actually talk to her about this, letting her know as much as I can without letting her know that it's her. (Example: Because I kept my feelings for her hidden the second time, I could and did tell her that this is the third time I've fallen for the person I've fallen for.)

But now, well, I'm not the most social person. I can't remember the last time I've really spent time with my peers. I mostly spend my time playing FFXIV with my dad, or going on Discord or watching YouTube or playing other video games. Or browsing Reddit. I've been doing lots of that recently.

Actually, I both kind of hope she does / doesn't go on this subreddit. Because she'll either see it as a huge coincidence, or she'll put the pieces together. I don't know if I want that to happen. I want to confess to her in person, and sooner rather than later, but at the same time, if she puts the pieces together herself then I don't need to worry about confessing, and she can't get upset about figuring it out on her own, but it feels wrong to not confess, and the idea of confessing not in person really doesn't sit well with me.

So, uh, I guess what I'm asking is, uh, what do I do?

Note: I don't currently go to university but I'm planning on it soon, actually need to apply soon, but I don't really know what I want to go into, but my only social interaction outside the house is at work, and I only interact with my co-workers (I work in E-commerce Fulfillment.)

So yeah. What should I do? 

Edit: Huh. Doesn't look like I mentioned that she already is happily in a relationship, so I know and accept that she doesn't reciprocate my romantic feelings.",romance

"There is this guy who I have been seeing lately and we have hung out almost every weekend since November (before Thanksgiving) and so, it's been a lot of time together because when we hang out we hang out for hours-- I also have been recently sleeping over at his place as of January, so this past weekend was my third time sleeping over. First thing I should say before I continue with this story is: yes, we have sex but we only have sex once or twice a night before calling it quits and doing other stuff together.

When we first hung out the first few times I thought ""wow, this is my dream guy, but kind of sad he won't like me"" since a lot of times that I have met someone who embodies all of the physical standards of mine end up finding someone else that embodies their needs and wants. But he's been consistently with me and telling me to accept myself and all of this positive stuff. I did tell him that I struggle with seasonal depression (and with my depression comes anxiety) and he's been trying to help me out with it lately by being there for me and getting me out of a routine that makes me feel like I'm stuck in an endless cycle.

Anyways, I keep straying from this story. There is a point to it. He's this 6 foot something 200 something pound guy who keeps in shape and he's sweet, funny, caring and overall amazing. But this dude keeps telling me ""I'm not looking for a relationship. I'm not looking to date"" and neither am I. I broke up with my first long term boyfriend back in October (I really tried the whole long distance but that was out of the door the moment he left back in August. I was already emotionally detached from him back in May of 2018) and I'm not looking to date at the moment. I think I'm more of exploring the different people in my life and having options before I date again. Well, we both established that we aren't looking to date and how we're just riding the waves.

That works for him. He likes not having labels, and enjoys being free and I need a little structure. I need to know if he's into me or if he thinks he is, or if he isn't. I'm not sure if it's me being dense but he does a lot of these cute things to me. I kind of just assumed they were how he treats every other girl he hangs out with, but he kisses my cheek and forehead a lot of the time, he hugs me and he'll give me kisses on my neck, and he smiles and laughs a lot when we're together and doing nothing. And he does this thing where we lay down he'll kind of stare at me as I talk and then he'll rub my ear as a comfort thing he's been doing since he was young. Sometimes he'll move my hair out of my face and he does this thing where he likes to put his weight on me and kind of hold me for a bit before I move.

Whenever I came over and he would play a game I would be quiet because he would be talking to his friends, but lately he's been talking to his friends and me at the same time. I found it pretty weird when he first started doing it, because he did this thing when he took my socks off and it surprised me, so I thought that it was really weird, so one day he reached over towards my leg and I had thought that he was going to take my socks off again, but no, he laughed and thought I was weird, so he said in his mic: ""Dude, she thought that I was going to take her socks off. she's so weird"" and in the same day he goes ""what's a good place in the city to take a girl out on a date?"" then turned to wink at me!

Also, back to my sleep overs with him, I left a hair clip at his place and then left makeup wipes and contact solutions and he says he enjoys that I leave my stuff at his place and that it reminds him of me or something along those lines and it really tripped me up. He's been saying a lot of these things that gets my hopes up. And our vibes that happen between us when we're together is amazing. He seems into me and when we hang out, we exist together and we exist in our own world and sometimes he know's how I feel-- I think. Like, when he looks at me he can feel how I feel towards him.

"I (19 M) can’t remember a time in my life where romance wasn’t the main driving force in my life. I’ve always had some infatuation or some feelings for someone and they just won’t go away. This is great in situations where the person is available and mutually interested, as the results of that have been the best parts of my life. However, this is often not the case, and high school was pretty miserable as it was not an environment where people were particularly open to forming a romantic/emotional bond with someone. 

I had developed a serious infatuation for this one girl that lasted about 5 years but I was never really able to act on it because of super awkward timing. This lasted through various different romantic encounters and relationships, but I could never kick it. 

Now in college I’m not bothered by that anymore as I got some closure, but I still find myself really discontent as I just find it impossible to act on my romantic desires now. 

Whenever I try to just “focus on myself”, it feels like I’m living against my true character. Any advice on suppressing this that won’t make me miserable? Or should I just go full send? ",romance

"I'm new to Reddit and have been truly fascinated by this community so I figured I would give it a try. I have a real life situation that I feel I've fallen into. Where to start. In 6th grade I met a boy, he was sweet, we talked and eventually started writing notes and letters to each other just back and forth. He was my first crush ever. We were preteens so I didn't think too much of it. One day in band I got an announcement on our pa telling me to pack my things I was going home. As I walked past the courtyard to the front of the school I passed by him. It was pure luck. We exchanged letters that we had on us yet again without realizing it was the last time. I looked cold so he gave me his jacket and said to give it back whenever. Unknown to me.. I got in the car with my little sister and my parents told us to get comfortable and that we would be on the road a few hours. Later we arrived in Austin in a new home. I cried. I read his last letter wrapped in his jacket and never felt so betrayed by my parents and lonely.
Time passed and in the start of high school we connected on MySpace. He found my name and sent me a friend request. I was happy again. At one point our friendship felt so good that I wanted to ask if he would be my long distance boyfriend and we could see each other when I would visit my aunt and uncle in his town where they all lived. Where I used to live.. But I backed out. I was too afraid of the response. We talked on and off for years. Both graduated high school. And in 2012 I broke up with a boy I had been dating for two years. I reconnected with my friend and we talked for a while and everything seemed great. But we fell off somehow. Later in 2013 I tried to message him through Facebook and got a nasty response from a female saying that he was about to get married and have a kid that was not yet born. So I left it alone and cried to myself thinking this was just life.
As the years passed I would get messages on Facebook from him asking how I was and we would let each other in on our lives. We talked about his marriage and his son and the many countries he visited while in the army. I had been in a relationship and living situation with a man myself so we were both growing up.
Now.. At this point it has been almost fifteen years since knowing him. I greatly consider him my best friend. I feel as if I can trust him completely and with anything I tell him. I got a message one day saying he wanted to talk to me about something so we did. He was unhappy in his marriage and was depressed. The advice I gave him was to simply do what is best to save it for the sake of his son and if he didn't feel happy after a few months then talk to his wife about it to work it out so that their son doesn't see how his parents are unhappy. It really affects children. He did so and months passed when he told me it wasn't working. He tried and tried and nothing. So he left her while making an agreement for divorce and a settlement of money he would send monthly as well as how often he would visit and call and face time their son. I wasn't happy that it was the result, but that's life.
As for me, my six year relationship is already at an end we are waiting to have the money to get our own places and move away from each other.
So around the same time me and my friend both are single and talking again. He's still going through his divorce and I'm still living with my ex until things are resolved.
The problem here is I am afraid at this point. At the beginning of the year we met each other for the first time since that last day in 6th grade. I no longer had his letters or jacket.. When he met me in my town we walked and talked. Ate a pizza. He is so handsome and still as sweet as ever. This past month during our talks and video chats he has said he loves me while both drunk and sober. He drinks with his brother which isn't a problem. But I'm worried because he says this over the phone but not either of the times we have seen each other. After our first encounter we met again when he drove almost 7 hours just to see me. No other reason. And no one has ever done such a thing for me before. It felt very romantic and like he really cares enough about me.
Now.. We feel the same about each other and have said this both through text and face to face. And I'm worried that while we are sorting out our situations we will fall apart over the possible six month or longer wait. I've always loved him and I almost feel like we have a magical story that spans over a decade. I'm not sure if I can still trust him in the same way I did as a kid. We're adults now. And as much as I love him that doesn't mean I'm not scared of what might happen or if I can even really expect a man to wait at least six months to be with me. Will he even wait? Or run after a woman in a bar?
Really the reason I posted this is to see what other people think of the situation. I kind of feel bad.. I mean he's still married. I'm still living with my ex for the time being. Are we wrong for this? Was I the cause of his failed marriage? Can I even trust him after all this time to be 100% honest and real with me? No relationship has ever worked for me and this is causing me to panic. I honestly don't know what to do about it now. I would be crushed and broken if this didn't work out simply because I feel as if he may be the one. We have seen each other twice this month and it has been very mild. We have kissed but nothing more. When we kissed for the first time it's like time stopped. I didn't want that moment to ever end. Now I'm left feeling like a pathetic hopeless romantic saying that I feel like I've found the one. Yet I'm so scared and worried that I may be over thinking the entire thing. When all I really want is a secure feeling knowing that I won't need to worry and that I can trust him. There are no guarantees. That's my story.",romance
What would you do in this circumstances,romance
"It seems very unlikely because I only rarely even feel infatuation, and after a few dates that tends to fall through one way or another. I would love to fall in mutual love with someone, but it feels like my match is so specific that I'm never gonna find that person. It feels like problems like career and physical distance will get in the way. If I can't even stay together with my friends in one place, how am I supposed to find someone I can do that with for decades? It feels impossible. It feels like a childish desire that will not come to fruition.

It's pretty sad to realize this, because it's pretty high on the list of things I want out of life. It used to be my nr 1 goal, and I used to actively pursue it, but it feels like I've lost a lot of heart lately.",romance

"It was an autumn day, me and my girlfriend (who was only a friend at the time) had arranged to meet up in town to go get coffee and to help me look for a new wallet. After finally picking a wallet and getting food there was still hours left until we had to catch the train back home so I suggested we go for a walk in the forest, this forest had a massive hill in the middle that was a clearing, you could get a truly beautiful view of the town from up there and so we decided to sit down and talk. Eventually evening came and the sky became a pinky sort of colour, the sky was mostly cloudy except for one massive hole in the cloud formation which just so happened to be right above us. We lay down there and gazed at the stars above us, we lay there for around 2 minutes in total silence until our hands slowly interlocked and we held each other's hands still not saying a word. It was truly one of the most magical moments of my life. You may think that it sounds too perfect and that this should be on

"Me and my boyfriend are high school sweethearts, but our relationship is far from perfect.

We've been together for 5 years, seeing another every few months at best. We mostly saw another *once or twice* a year. We are only *15 minutes apart* distance-wise.

In the beginning we saw another almost every day since we were in school. After I graduated I went to college 80 miles away (commuting by train). He broke his leg shortly after. He was bedridden for about 2 - 3 years due to surgeries (got a rod put in w/ nails, but they hurt, so he slowly got them taken out and had to heal over and over again). Neither of us had a car.

As a result, most of our relationship has happened on FaceBook.

Due to this, we barely have any memories, are rarely intimate, and to make things worse he's someone who has anxiety about being in a relationship - and doing ANY outdoor activity (due to fear of socializing, breaking another bone, or preferring to be indoors). He was a very sheltered child, which may play a role.

I got a car last year and though it would improve things, but his anxiety has proved otherwise.

Recently we started seeing each other more (once every 2 weeks-ish), but we always go to the movies because his anxiety stops him from doing anything else. I've offered alternative ways to spend time in order to bond with him, but he's never willing to try new things. It's almost as bad as it was before.

I've broken up with him a few times due to the sheer unhappiness, loneliness, and disappointment of our relationship. We always fall back together because we care about another, but we are always on a different page when it comes to everything.

I contemplate whether this is a real relationship or one worth having. Any thoughts? We are very different people. I'm starting to realize that, as much as I love him, he may always hold me back if I keep falling back in.",romance

"Okay, so a couple of months back I (23F) got a friend request from this (24) from a group we both belong to. Now, I really only have Facebook to keep in touch with friends who live out of state and I normally don't accept requests from people whom I haven't met face-to-face, however, I thought 'hey, this guy seems alright' and accepted. We both live in different states and don't have the means to actually meet irl, but we've been messaging me for a bit and he seemed to like me right out of the gate, where as I'm really starting to get some feelings for him now. He seems very sweet and kind, we have a lot of similarities (more than I thought I'd have with any guy). However, I have high personal morals, standards and expectations, which he seems to respect. Then, a couple of weeks ago I found out that he is in the middle of a divorce. I'm not upset about it all and was glad about his honesty, which made me like him more. But I laid it out straight: I won't get into any romantic relationship with him until his divorce is finalized and he is officially not married to his ex anymore. I've told him this and he agrees! But I'm a wary person and want to meet him face-to-face before committing to anything. It's like with anyone: I don't really know a person until we're face to face. I am finding I like him more and more each day, which is something I've never experienced before. I've also only had one boyfriend ever and that was in highschool and it didn't really go anywhere serious. Other than that I've been single, so this is all a bit new to me.

They broke up and somehow we got a second chance at love. This time I was able to return those feelings. He was very hesitant about me because of our age difference. 10 year difference. 
Regardless I fell in love with him so fast. I was ready to really commit to him. Everything we planned for our future kids marriage a successful life together, I took to heart.  I genuinely meant every promise and every dream. However he changed his mind. He broke up with me. And not even a month later he gets back with his ex.

Recently I’ve felt like we have become closer than before. The other night he told me he loved me, super casually however he isn’t the most verbal about his feelings. During a car ride w some buddies. I started telling a story or talking about something (two other friends are rowdy and drunk in the back seat) he turns to me and says “I’m listening to you.” 

Honestly it’s little things and I’m not sure if he is just a wonderful friend or it could potentially be more. Either way, I really do love him as a person and am cool w just being his best friend, but part of me itches to know if it could be more.

We met, we clicked, and that was it. He was interesting to me back then. Someone I felt was worth pursuing. And, boy, was it worth it!

I fell in love pretty quickly, as is my style. This time, it was different. It wasn’t purely out of desperation, or out of fear of being alone. I fell in love with the man I was with.

He is sweet. He is kind. He is considerate. Sometimes he’s a bit blunt, but this is who he is and I appreciate the honesty.

He would not say something unless he meant it and last night, when he said those words to me, my heart soared. I honestly started thinking about our future. It seems more real, now.

"It’s a loooong story but I feel like I could use some advice so here goes nothing.
My fiancé and I have been together for 6 years and engaged for just under 5. It was literally like a week before the 5th anniversary of our engagement that he broke it off. 
We hadn’t been intimate in 2 months, and not for my lack of trying (or begging). I could feel him pulling away, and I tried a sexy maneuver. He shut it down and told me we needed to talk. 

Now some back story; my fiancé suffers from mild agoraphobia and a pretty severe anxiety disorder. He’s held a job for the last 2 years and is going back to school to get his GED, he even has his own car now. But for the longest time I had to take care of him, at the expense of living my life. And I knew this going in, I did it because I was so in love with him nothing else mattered. I never once made him feel like I resented him, because I didn’t. My philosophy was that if you can’t handle the bad times then you don’t deserve the good times. And let me make this clear, when it was good it was so good. Like the movies. When it was bad... you get the picture. 

So he says he wants to take a step back, he feels like he’s dragging me down with him and that he needs to get his life in order before we move forward. And on some levels I get it, I really do. He’s got old school values, he believes the man should be the protector and provider and he feels he hasn’t been that for me. He’s about to be 28 and still hasn’t made anything of himself and hasn’t achieved his dreams. So like I said I get it. What I don’t get is why that means we had to break off the engagement. We weren’t in a rush, yes I have been bringing up that I wanted to talk about setting a date but nothing was set in stone and I wasn’t being pushy. We’d been engaged for almost 5 years, and now he has doubts? It just doesn’t add up to me. I would be inclined to think there was someone else but here’s the clincher... he only goes to work and school and comes home. He never goes out without me. He doesn’t have time. He’s too tired to go out. Etc. 

We’re still together and trying to work on things, but it’s been a month and I think I’ve made up my mind. I’m going to give him just under a year. If we aren’t re-engaged, or haven’t made significant progress by 1/1/2020... I’m done. I love him with every fiber of my being and I’m pretty sure it would kill a pretty big part of me to do it but I’d leave him. I owe it to him and myself to see if this thing can work, I’ve put so much effort into this, being there for him, being his comfort, and loving him that I just can’t throw it away. But ever since I’ve come for this decision I feel different. I still love him the same and all those statements are still true but... it’s almost like a weight has been lifted off me. I can’t imagine my life without him in it but lately I’ve been thinking about it...Making plans about what I’m going to do when it happens...thinking about being single...
I feel horrible and relieved at the same time. 
What do I do? Am I doing the right thing? I don’t know what to think anymore...
Tl;dr my fiancé and I broke off our engagement and I need some advice. Honestly just read it lol",romance
"  

Hello everyone!

I have a question. My boyfriend and I are both in our late 20’s, we’ve been together 1.5 years – it has been a relationship filled with a lot of love, travel, great memories and bettering each other. Initially we’d make jokes about what we’d name our children, but it was never serious discussion. We both share the same values on wanting to have children and be married. 

Yesterday I brought up the topic, asking him if he saw a future for us. He said logically he’d want to marry me, however, right now he feels like he has not yet got a direction for his life and there are certain ‘circumstances’ that he feels still have to be sorted, so he cannot give me a ‘definitive’ answer about our future. As you can imagine, this made me feel upset. He says he loves me and that ‘we’ll be fine’, let’s continue to grow, that I’m the most unique girl he has ever been with etc. He says I’m a great person and that if we didn’t end up getting married, it would be his loss etc. But what does all that mean?

He then asked me, how long I would be willing to wait, to which I responded – I didn’t know/have timelines because honestly I’ve never been in this situation before and have never put an expiry date on when I think I should get married. So I couldn’t answer that question. He has often said he wanted to be with me long term, but that was never clear as to whether it meant marriage or not.

From the above, does anyone have any interpretation or thoughts/perspectives on my situation? I really love him and want to be with him; but I also have the fear of ‘wasting’ time. At the same time, I keep thinking, if I walk away prematurely, what if I regret it, what if I leave too soon/early? There’s a whole world of uncertainty out there. The whole thing just makes me very upset. Do I wait and see? Do I go through the heart-break and hope I’ll meet someone else? I can’t imagine life without him, I love him to bits and I’m not ready to let him go, I don’t want to let him go. ",romance

"I've been trying to find an answer to this question but most of the stuff I found is more statistical rather than providing answers as in the studies of more people not getting married and such.

 I've only been in a couple of relationships and now that I'm close to thirty I'm not at all interested in meeting someone for a long term or short term relationship. I have an average life with friends, family, my hobbies and work so a lot of people ask ""what about dating"" or ""go try dating apps"". I've done online dating and speed dating but nothing clicks even if I do end up on a date or two with someone. Its just one of those things that never seem to cross my mind on an average day. Sometimes it feels like if I don't try and find someone I'm left out or people say that you'll find someone because its an important part of being an adult. I know all that but there is something about dating and finding romance that feeling like a horrible mistake or the person feels more like an intruder rather than someone who I want in my life. I don't really want romantic dinners or holding hands in public. If anything I'd rather my partner treat me like a best friend. I don't even know if I want to be a wife. I mean I'm already looking into buying a house in the next couple of years and a year ago my coworker said to me ""What about the husband and kids, you should wait until that happens first."" None of that crossed my mind and its still not a concern. Even my mom said she felt sorry for me for feeling this way and that kind of hurt as it made me feel abnormal. 

So I want to know, is this a normal thing. Is it normal that some people just not want to date and want to be independent or at least not want a husband or wife?  I know that asexuality exists but I'm not sure if I fall into that category. I'm also not sure if this is the right place to ask but I figured maybe people here know what I'm asking about or know people who are similar. ",romance

Also, it’s important to note that I do care for him tremendously and like him for him. He’s not the cutest (I know) or the brightest, but he brings me so much happiness that I forget all of that. Maybe that’s love, I’m not sure. But he makes my heart feel so happy. I’m not sure. If anyone has gone through any similar situations, lmk. ",romance

Sometimes I think why me and why every girl I seem to fall for chooses another guy. It’s become the norm for me and something that is hurting inside. I may never show this to my friends and family how I feel on the outside but this sucks.

"So. I met this guy at a club in early October. I got his number and we talked for a few days before we met up. I had a good time and I liked him, and we agreed to meet up again. During the week, we didn’t text much, which is completely fine by me. At some point he asked when we could meet up again and we decided on a week later (cause that week he was travelling). Before he travelled, I texted him “have a safe flight”. He didn’t reply, that’s fine. Two days later, I texted “hey how was the UK”, he didn’t reply. He didn’t reply for the entire week. So a day before we were supposed to meet up I asked if we’re still on for tomorrow. He said yes and was supposed to come to my city. However, the next day (the day he was supposed to come) he texted saying that he’s sorry and can’t come. I said sorry to hear that and hope that everything is fine. I didn’t try contacting him again and he didn’t either. Not gonna lie, I was disappointed cause I liked him, but I mean if he was interested he would’ve contacted me again or put in some effort. So I got over him. But then today (so 2 months later) he texted “hey it’s been a while”. No shit man. I replied casually and now the convo is casual.
Why do you guys think he replied 2 months later? How do I deal with is? If he asks to meet up what do I say? Part of me thinks I should just be normal, cause I mean I barely knew the guy. We only met up once and we’re not close enough for me to have been totally upset about his ghosting. But another part is like, sista if he acted like this before who’s to say he won’t again. After all, how a person acts says a lot about their personality. What’s your take on this?",romance

I'm a young midwife and I work in the delivery ward. My boss (around 50 y.o., the head doktor of our ward) is known as a not so nice, overly demanding man.

My co-workers were teasing me that he's hitting on me but I refused to believe that, he was acting like a perfect gentleman. We exchanged occassional smiles in the halls, chatted on occassions and that was it. I didn't admit I have a crush on him to anyone, especially him. Long story short, he gave me a short kiss two days ago when we were alone and said ""I would like to continue this, but we work together so I can't"". I left his office without saying anything, I was too shocked. Despite his words he already grabbed my hand a few times or said sth inappropriate when there was a possibilty of being seen/heard. He's in the middle of a divorce right now.

"So warning in advance this is gonna be really pathetic and soppy and saccharin and whatever else, but I guess that's nothing new to this subreddit!

So I'm in no way a 'romantic' person. I'm in a relationship with a girl I met in high school, we recently had our 4 year anniversary and I love her to bits. We barely argue, we make each other laugh, we live together and everything's great, but we're definitely one of those couples who don't show PDA, and who on a night, instead of snuggling up and having cute chats and stuff we'd be more likely to smoke a joint and watch some Netflix comedy.

I've never considered myself romantic like I said, but that's why I need help with this next bit.

We just recently moved into a block of flats, and I swear to god this is going to sound like it's from a Richard Curtis movie but it's honestly true. \*deep breath\* ... I spoke to a girl on my floor for probably 30 seconds as we were waiting for the lift, and I think I'm in love with her.

All I know is that I saw her smile and something inside me went off (not that!). I feel like I need to tell someone, so here I am. I can't tell my long-term girlfriend I'm infatuated with someone else, least of all someone I don't even know and who lives down the hall from us.

Does this make me a bad person? Is this a sign my relationship isn't working? I've always considered myself to be happy and we have a healthy relationship like I said. We don't argue, sex life is good etc. But what I feel for this girl I have not felt for my girlfriend (nor for anyone ever). It literally was like love at first sight, an insane notion as far as I've always been concerned but I guess ultimately it's just chemicals in the brain right?

In the morning I hope I bump into her again (I haven't yet) and I saw her leave the flat with some guy the other day (her boyfriend I presume) and it crushed me. How? I don't even know her! All I know is this better pass, because I can't be in an honest committed relationship when I feel like this for another girl.

Please someone tell me you've experienced something similar and it'll pass, or that I'm not crazy. WHAT IS THIS? What should I do? I tell my girlfriend everything but I can't tell her this. Please give me some kind of advice! Thanks.",romance

"Have you ever noticed that when a girl asks a guy out she is seen as either desperate or aggressive? I have never been someone who was good at waiting for the guy to make the first move, and to be honest it hasn’t really worked out in my favor. My friends say that my methods are too aggressive. “Let them come to you.” The only thing that runs through my mind though is ‘what if they never do.’ 

How is someone supposed to know you like them if you do not say it? If I decide not to take initiative and nothing ever happens then I will always wonder, what if.

I like a boy. I have not felt this kind of giddy sensation in years. I just have no clue if he is even interest in me.

Here is some background. He is in my class. There is exactly one week left in the semester and only one day left of the class I have with him. After this I will probably never see him again. I only have two options, make the first move, or move on and keep him as a crush of the past. 

I want to tell him how I feel, but I fear that my confession will most likely come as a surprise. We have only ever texted in group messages and I have never hung out with him outside of class. I almost feel stupid for obsessing over a guy that I guess I do not really know.

The first day of class I saw him and I just felt it. It’s not something over the top like love at first sight or anything, but I felt that spark. The more I got to know him in class the harder I fell, but he has no idea.

The worst thing that could happen is ultimately rejection. I have been able to handle rejection in the past. It doesn’t feel good. It never does. However, I have never been rejected by a boy I truly have feelings for. 

I’m scared of being rejected, but I’m also scared that I will never talk to him again. He makes me excited to go to class, which is insane because college kinda sucks. It is hard and stressful, but everyday when I had that class I felt happy. 

I was planning on texting him when the semester ended. However, I want to go into my last day of class with him knowing how I feel. Too bad I do not have the balls to actually do it.

I was hoping that if I waited long enough maybe he would eventually make some kind of move or a sign that he is at all interested, but he hasn’t. This means that my confession will most likely end in rejection. If it does then I just have to remember that one day someone will want me and this guy just was not the one. It will happen. I am just tired of waiting for the day when it does.

Update: for anyone who wants to know: I asked him to hang out and this is his exact response “Yeah I’d be down to. But I don’t want to give you the wrong impression. I’m not looking for anything “ 
So yeah I’m currently feeling pretty bad. He said we will talk more about it in class on Wednesday 
Thanks for the advice everyone at least now I know 😕

"It is often said that trust is like a fragile glass to be handled with utmost care because one broken, it cannot be mended, and should you technically succeed in mending it, the scars never seem to go away. If concerted efforts are not made, if stringent measures are not taken on the part of the parties involved to mend as best as possible a broken trust, more wounds, sometimes even bigger tend to open up. 

   ""He/she does not trust me anymore, she does not trust me anymore despite all the efforts I've made to win back his trust, despite all the sacrifices I've made to make him realize I've changed"". How can he/she trust you when your motives are not genuine and sincere? When you keep making efforts and sacrifice simply to win back his or her trust? Actions are judged by intentions, by intended and not by extended outcome. How can he or she be sure that if he/she trusts you again, you will not betray him and break the newly established cord of trust again. As a matter of fact, chances are that you will than you won't. Instead of making efforts and sacrifices in other for him/her to trust you again, why don't you be very open enough and be who you truly are with him or her.  Let him/her know when he/she is doing things that tend to tempt you into doing things that will most likely make him/her not to trust you, even when he/she doesn't seem to be doing anything to push you to betray the little trust he/she has for you but somehow, for some reason you still feel like betraying him/her, let him/her know...

"WHY COMMONSENSE?
 
   The ability to think in a practical way and make sensible decisions is the definition given to the term commonsense by the OALD (8TH Edition).

   Like water and oil, it's quite amazing that some people still believe in this day and age, that the term has no place when it comes to pure, genuine, profound and sincere love, that if sense and reasoning is very much alive and kicking in the relationship, that the relationship cannot be said to exist based on true love, that true love makes one think, say and do stupid things, like if one isn't making among other wise choices, unreasonable choices, then one is most probably not is love. Because thought and reason tend to give way for the vehicle of love when it's fully in motion to pass through, it is important therefore that one teaches oneself by training the brain to prepare proactively and not reactively to the eventual swift and forceful passage of the vehicle of love in other for the strong emotion of love not to continue to overpower the very essential commonsense when one is in love. 

   Every living organism no matter how infinitesimal has an organ for reasoning commonly known as the brain. The most vital and most delicate organ in humans, it's role in insects isn't as important in comparison but nevertheless still exists. Why then would anyone under any circumstance want to put this very complex organ that plays very vital roles one of which is the regulation of respiration without which ones life...

"A couple of months ago I was in a relationship with a nice girl 1year older than me. We have a lot in common. 
I had met her through a dating app. We first chatted with each other using the app a bunch of days then we started calling each other every evening. And our conversations would last for hours and hours. To a point where I was way too tired when I get to work. I finally met her in person and I spent some nights with her in her flat. 
I was supposed to spent only the weekend at her flat. Cause then I'd have to go back to work and it was in a relatively far away town. I ended missing two days ( the enterprise I was in was very nice with those kind of things, I just did not got paid for those two days ). So to sum it up I spent 5 days with her. 
I got back home just before night time. We called each other as we used to do. For hours once again.
I went to work the next day and I had to catch up all the work I did not do because I was with her. So as you can expect I was even more tired getting back home than usual.
And the phone call we had this evening was significatively shorter. 
And it lasted for the rest of the week. 
The weekend I went to see a close friend of mine who had invited me to meet his new girlfriend for dinner. And this evening while I had told her I would not be available to phone call her she still wanted us to talk. Once I got back home I called her ( it was 3am approximatively ) she told me she wanted a break up because she felt that after we spent time together I was more distant.
I honestly at this moment wanted the same thing. I thought she requested too much from me and the 5 days we spent together were not really good I felt bored because she did not want to do some activities with each other. 

And now since 2 or 3 months I want her back. I feel like those times together even if we just did chores at her flat were really good. I miss her so much. My friends told me not to text her and I don't know what to do anymore.

"Have you ever expressed a love interest in someone especially at a  very young age but got hurt as your feelings were unreciprocated? Did you or do you ever wonder why he or she never liked you romantically  despite the efforts you seemed to have made? Are you currently pondering, running simulations after simulations as to why your likeness or love for someone is or was unrequited? 

   The solution to this puzzle is quite simple. The reason why the one you like didn't or doesn't seem to like you in return whilst the one or the ones that seem to like you, you barely notice or feel their presence whenever they're around you is pretty obvious - climbing the ladder, looking forward and aiming higher.  We all look forward as we move ahead in life. We seldom look backwards to see what's behind us because looking forward is the most essential part of moving forward. Imagine having to look forward while walking or driving on a busy street. even if you have a justifiable reason for doing so. You'll most likely end up creating more problems than  solutions for yourself. Also, although we tell ourselves that we do not choose the person with whom we fall in love, it just happens randomly, I never really saw myself liking someone like him or her, etc. The truth is that we do very well choose that person we like, the person with whom we fall in love, subconsciously however and not necessarily consciously. The subconscious act of choosing the person we're attracted to and would like to date is based on our soft spots, opinions, views, ideologies, wants and desires, all of which can be said to be based on our level of wisdom, knowledge, exposure, experiences and enlightenment.

"Before you all start saying ""nO. LOve oNlY mAtTeRs In rEAl LifE"" just listen...

I have an online best friend, I have been talking with him for just over 2 months now.
We met on an online game and we progressively developed from texting to talking on the mic to doing face time occasionally.

We are around the same age range (I'm 3 years older) recently I felt myself feel rather connected to him. I trust him with a lot... As does he trust me.

So here's my dilemma...
I felt myself falling in love with him...I hate long distance relationship...they make me feel rather lonely...

He lives in Portugal and I live in the UK. He said once him and I finish education he's moving down to England.

I stupidly said to him tonight ""I want to stop talking"" you can imagine his distress as he relies in me for self esteem and he feels very connected (to the extent that he admitted to crying once I said this)
He was confused so I explained that I didn't want to fall in love with him and I felt myself doing just that. I explained I had a long distance relationship before but the last guy cheated on me....my trust for LDR's decreased then...
He then promised me that he would not cheat 100%.

Although he never did specify... I'm confused...
Would you say we are dating now...
He says ""I love you"" a lot...(sounds dumb but whatever lol) he says he didn't know that I liked him and he was happy...he was very very happy once we were talking on mic only one hour after having the long discussion about my last LDR.

How can I bring it up to ask if we are dating...I'm so confused...",romance

"#TRUELOVE - Is It Blind? Should It Be Blind?

 From the sentimental point of view, one might say yes. True love is blind. But commonsensically, true love does not necessarily have to be blind.
 
   Love itself has to do with sentiments - feelings based on emotions. If one claims to love someone or something, one has automatically declared his sentiments for that thing or that person and will therefore react and relate towards it/him/her accordingly. But because when true love is blind it can be more destructive than productive, it is commonsensically unadvisable. This does not in anyway take anything away from the fact that true love being blind implies that it's unconditional and anything short of it may arguably be said not to be true love.
 
   In summary true love by simple definition is blind but doesn't necessarily have to be. It can be blind but not reckless nor careless (as is characteristic of people who are literally blind). Nothing beats true love mixed with a good dose of commonsense. One must therefore  learn to be...

"Men just like women have their wants and needs. For almost every man, there are most likely if not most definitely four types of women/five major types of things a man wants and needs in a woman.
   The one that gets him, almost every part of him. She sees and connects with him very deeply intellectually and psychologically and because of this, she's the one with whom he talks about almost everything and anything. His relationship with her is not born out or borders much on the line of emotions and sex neither does he have any ulterior motives whatsoever towards her. He's not in love with her but is quite emotionally invested in her. Because he connects with her so well intellectually and psychologically as much as she with him, they can talk with each other from morning till night and from night till dawn about everything and anything. With this one, it's not that he isn't sexually attracted to her, no. But her understanding of his persona and quirks is so profound that it completely overshadows the sexual attraction he has for her. Most people will think he's...

Some say that's the last person you should marry. Both provide valid reasons. I thought I'd open up a broader discussion here and on a few other subs.,romance

"I’m a 12 years old high school kid. I asked for guidance here a while ago, and I have gotten very close to the girl I like, so much that half of the people in our class ship us together. The only problem is, one of my friends told me than after asking the girl I like if she would date me, she said that I’m a nerd, and she doesn’t date nerds. The way my friend said it sounded very harsh, and I don’t think that’s literally what she said, but I’m still pretty concerned. I play a lot of video games, I program video games, I’m very good at school, I’m Asian, I have glasses, and I’m pretty socially awkward, so that’s probably where she got the nerd idea. I’m honestly not sure what to do. Should I aim on being more confident and less socially awkward, or should I just continue talking to her?",romance
"What is your philosophy in life? What is life? What is life to you? How do we know good from bad? 

Is it really bad for someone to steal something? Is it really bad to lie? if so how? Because society said so? Who is the society to shape how we are? Because God said so? How can I believe God if there is no solid evidence of God existing? Will we be punished for those so called ""Bad"" things that we do? If so how? If it's bound to happen it's bound to happen, isn't it? I know sometimes i feel that something bad happens to me because I've done something bad before, that could possibly cause this other bad thing to happen to me, even though they have nothing to do with each other, is it because of Karma? Is Karma even real?  Because even when i do good i don't get any good, I still get the same shit, what's the point of doing any good if you don't get anything back? I know that sounds selfish but I've had enough of being selfless.

I guess it's only fair to get something bad done to you when you've done something bad to someone else, but how is it fair when you do something good and something bad still happens to you? ",romance
"  

She woke up and saw her brother sleeping on his writing table in the room. They were not rich enough to have a large house with many rooms, they only could afford this small flat with one room and squeezed everything the needed in it. He usually slept on the table while writing when could not fight with the sleep any longer. Last night he worked for longer hours and gave in to sleep, she could not tell when because she never woke as late as he. She approached him, kissed his head and took a page he fell sleep writing last night, he had no work and contributed to income only through writing short stories online, sometimes they got long and he had to finish them on another day. The page was not completely filled so she thought maybe she can peak into the ending of the story and began to read because there was still time for her to be ready and go to work.

""How can love for something drive you crazy day by day slowly, slowly. When you really want something but it is just out of your range. Like a good video game for a kid who passes by the video store every day and desire it, looks at it, but just can't buy it. If that happens to you long enough you will eventually give into madness. It is same with me dear sister. I know that you have brought me up and have been taking care of me ever since our parents and are like a mother to me. You worked two jobs only to feed me when I was little and unable to earn any money, hell I still am, and these writings are not very well accepted because somehow my own self creeps into them, my passion is expressed and society does not like it. But what can I do, I can't keep it in.""

With a thundering heart she turned the page.

""Seeing you going coming out of bathroom with your wet hair and then swaying it in the room where I could see every single day. I have to say something to someone, anyone, since I couldn't say it to you I started writing hence most of my stories base on the subject. I am sorry for hiding it, but I feared that you would hate me for what and how I feel about you. But this feeling is just uncontrollable and I can't hold it any longer but before I do anything that would discern your disapproval, I am going to go away from you. I am going to leave you, because I can't stop loving you.

Her heart was thundering her hands were trembling, her body was shaking her head was aching. Tears dripped from her eyes as she realized that her brother was deeply in love with her but she could not respond in kind. She had to maintain herself and him as well, otherwise the society would not let them live. They will be driven away and hunted down. As many before them were hung, burnt alive, thrown in pits and executed in most horrible ways thinkable. They will forever be named demons and children as abomination their legacy a curse, they will not find a place to hid and there will be no escape from their plight. She shook her brother up to wake him up but he did not move and his head slipped from table. Horrified she looked at him for a second and began to sob. She dare not touch him and only hoped that it was not true, she only hopped that he was alive. She wanted to call his name out loud but she had lost her voice, frozen in her step her body was paralyzed. When she broke off it she leapt on him checked his pulse, tried to find it, failed and let out a howl. Her body began to convulse rapidly and fell on him, face close to his. She closed her eyes, put her arm on his head and kissed him on lips.",romance

"Hi there mom,

Mom, thanks for making me a strong woman who knows how to think logically and independently. Thank you for showing me how to work a kitchen, clean until my fingers cracked and how to place on perfect makeup. 

For showing me I can be as smart, nerdy, and confident as I want...unless there's a man around.... 

Training your daughter to become an idiot in sight of an attractive man to appear cute. Scolding her whenever she beat a boy at a video game or match of wits. Beating her into repeating sexist phrases about women in kitchens and  men needing to be worshipped the moment they walked through the door. 

Thanks mom, all that worked and now your 27 year old daughter had to go on a damn trip to discover herself and struggles with men. Believing she will never be considered beautiful because you told her that her apparence was lacking anything desirable. Telling her to submit so she can be loved. Your daughter now runs to becomes a studdering fool whenever an attractive male even appears near her! Did you know your daughter hasn't dated in 5 years because she enjoys seeing a man clean and has been conditioned to think that's wrong!!! 

Or how about teaching your daughter to worship the male body in bed? Forgot about your needs and desires, it's all about them! Well now your daughter has developed a BDSM fetish and panics whenever she is touched! oh yeah, your daughter can't stand casual touch because you groomed her to accept any man's advances no matter how creepy! 

Thanks mom. I enjoyed this journey of self discovery. I worked out some of these problems, kind of. I still adore men and worship their form like a pervert behind closed doors. However, your daughter has gotten burned and has not experienced being loved...

She was treated as a pet in all her relationships. She was kept because she cooked, clean, and couldn't say no. 

She's afraid now mom. She's afraid she will end up alone, used or unwanted. She hid her real self from friends because you trained her to hide if she was around people. 

You're daughter is 27, working on her masters, creating beautiful works of art, beating up monsters in table top rpgs and video games. She talks about her love of books and philosophy now. She loves metal and European pop. She is even considered a weeaboo, like you would ever know what that is. 

But she is very lonely. Most of her friends are married now or in a relationship. She doesn't like hanging out because she feels like the 3rd wheel. She still can't talk to guys, it's almost painful. Sometimes she thinks about those past boyfriends and wonders if it was because she stopped listening to you is why she will always be alone. 

She hasn't felt loved. 

Thanks mom, you trained your daughter well. The only problem is that the year is 2018 not 1950...",romance

"As I Dreamt it

We had had a wonderful time together. Out and about in Atlanta just enjoying the city. It felt great to have a friend. Someone I could go out with or sit on the couch and talk about nothing with. I felt comfortable with him, but I also had my reservations. I knew he liked me. The way I would catch him stealing glances. Or the way he would flash me that sweet little crooked smile whenever our eyes would meet. But I just couldn't say anything, and as shy as he was I doubted he would either. Nevertheless, I was plagued by my insecurities. My last relationship ended in complete and utter heartbreak. I had loved in a way I never before. But he told me he could never be happy with me and like that he was gone. Just a memory. A love lost. A culmination of what I foolishly thought was forever, ending in a puddle of tears. 

Fast forward, so here I am walking down peachtree street. Laughing and feeling comfortable with this man. The chemistry between us almost as thick as the notorious Atlanta humidity. But whenever I would look at him and feel so alive, so enthralled, I couldn't help but feel afraid. I couldn't imagine another broken heart. I wouldn't make it through another broken heart.

 ""Did you hear that?"" I said. ""Yeah"" he replied ""it sounded like thunder."" We lock eyes for a quick second and both look away as we sheepishly giggle. ""If only he knew how fast my heart was beating right now. ""That wasn't  thunder fool that was my heart beating loudly for you, duh."" I say jokingly.
In his crazy good English accent he replies, ""Oh, well my dear pardon my mistake. How could I possibly confuse the sound of thunder with that of the human heart.""

""It's ok,” I say, “just don't let it happen again."" I turn to look at him again we smile and I wink. 
It was silent for a moment, however it seemed like an eternity. I thought to myself,  ""Quick Summer, say something."" 

""Wouldn’t it be funny if it started to......"" No sooner had I opened my big mouth did the rain begin to pour down on us. Why couldn't I just have enjoyed the silence? He grabs my hand and we make a mad dash for the nearest covering. 

Feeling both annoyed and excited, I scream. ""Ahhhh, this sort of stuff only happens in movies, what the hell!"" Then it hits us, uncontrollable laughter. There we are just taking it all in laughing because honestly, we were silly enough to go without an umbrella. In a mocking English accent  recounting an earlier conversation and between bursts of laughter I say to him, ""I checked my weather app, there is only a 20% chance of rain, we don't need an umbrella."" 

I laugh again, this time my forehead gently rests on his shoulder. ""Oh shoot"" I think to myself, ""when and how did we end up in this sort of embrace?"" That is when I realized I was the only one still laughing. I could feel his hands slowly tightening around my waist. His embrace was sending chills down my lower back straight to my toes. But I couldn't bring myself to look at him. As my hands rested on his shoulders and his hands wrapped around my waist, I stood there staring down at my feet. Listening to the rain pour and the thunder clap. Why couldn't I look at him? I was afraid that the moment I looked into his eyes, he would be able to read my thoughts. He would discover my secrets.He would see the past hurts and insecurities that have kept me at a safe distance. He would undoubtably see the fear. He would know in that instance, in that moment that I loved him. ""But he can't know?"" I thought to myself, my heart beating ever so quickly. I don't want to be hurt again. “Still looking down, I moved to take a step back, but he held on tighter. ""Look at me"" he whispered. I shook my head. It was my last attempt at guarding my heart. 

He gently placed  his hands under my chin and lifted my face upward. I was looking right into his eyes, searching hoping to find answers to questions, questions that at the moment were irrelevant. ""Can I kiss you?"" He asked. I knew if he kissed me things between us would never be the same. But I didn't care because in that moment as the rain fell around us, as I looked into his eyes the world became still and I felt no need to fight ""it"" any longer.I hesitantly nodded and slowly closed my eyes.

"I asked the girl I had never so strongly about before in my life out a date.
Never have I ever been interested in dating in High school until I met her.
That's what set her apart from everyone else.
She said NO. She said NO because she does not want to date in High School. I understood her perspective and said that's fine. But we still talk as friends.
But who knew she would be the greatest person to talk to.
I had that gut feeling she would be everything I expected her to be.
Her imperfection was her own perfection.
She is very socially awkward, I was the first guy to approach her and try to connect on a deeper level with.
This is/was new territory for her but she handled it well.
Like just today while we're talking in the halls, she asked me why I liked her. She could not believe I liked her. 
I said these halls aren't long enough for me to give the explanation you want.
So after school, we talked over text about that one thing for three hours.
She said to me ""Why to waste your time with me,"" ""I don't believe I am worth your time,"" ""I am most likely nothing you expect or want.""
I said to her, ""I expect nothing of you and want nothing of you but yourself.""
And I explained to her that I the reason why I felt strongly about her was that she was a real person.
She had problems but didn't hide them. 
In my eyes, she was beautiful, cute but herself took the ten to a two hundred.
Most of the people will mask it and conform to what is occurring around but not her.
Her imperfections were the perfection that finished her smile and made her laugh like a beautiful sound of nature.
Weird enough we both like Disney stuff.
From movies to tv shows we could talk about it forever.
I never told her that the quote from Good Luck Charlie is something I will always believe in.
Bob Duncan (the Dad) said to PJ (the son),
""Son, if you truly love something set free because if it comes back to you its meant to be.""
As creepy as this sounds, She might as well be the most influential person I've met.
And if I stood by that quote then, 
I hope to see you down the road and try this again someday.
Paths cross in more ways than one.
Who knows if we are meant to be or if we are not but time will only tell.
I don't think I'll have a problem letting go in the future, however,
as we walk down the halls even once a week in school, I don't think I'll let go just yet.
Hanging on by the smallest thread but as I finish my Senior year of High School I cannot bring myself to date anyone else.
That's what set her apart from everyone else.",romance

I don't judge her at all, but I actually find it quite depressing in my opinion. If someone can find a lasting, fulfilling relarionship out of that, then cool. But for me, I'd need *some* time to breathe. 

Those feelings of validation within a relationship can be quite powerful. I think its healthy to be single for at least a *little bit.*

"Warning this is going to be a long one. And to fully understand something I’ll explain some stuff here.
1. When you win your heat in swimming (8 people) you get a rubber ducky.
2. We are all swimmers.
3. When you go into someone’s lane you have to stay with them for three hours (all of practice).
4. There are time intervals that you leave on in swimming, the leader of this lane is in charge of when to leave.

I’ve liked this girl for about 4 years and have been friend zoned, she’s a tan chinese girl who is about 5.9 ft, pretty face and good body, she’s really social being friends with almost everyone I know. We first met when i was 12, we both swim for the same swim team, when I first met her she was shy but very kind to me, we eventually became friends and nothing happened for like a month, until this guy asks her out (on a date) and she says yes I was watching it as this happened but did nothing, it was at this moment I got really jealous and mad, I never realized it but I guess I liked her. From then on it became a competition between me and Tyler, who could be the nicest to her who would talk the most to her, who’s lane she went in (it’s a swimmers thing) who could give the best presents. I started off by getting close to her friends, which was easy because I actually got along with them really well. Then I started coming in her and her friends lane and leading it, this became our close little group of friends I became labeled as the “gay guy” in the group of females. But hey... it worked. Her birthday comes around and I go totally overboard, I give her a cap, with Micheal Phelps, Ryan Lochte, Nathan Adrian, missy franklin and Ariana cougars, and a iTunes gift card, Tyler gives her a Mickey Mouse plush toy.  I get a text from her about how sweet I am you know whatever, nothing really happens for around another year besides me and her hanging out in the group together nothing really happening. Except for Valentine’s Day, Tyler got her nothing and she gave him a card, we have a swim meet on that weekend, so I win a total of 7 events in one day (one was against Tyler) so what I do is I get the 7 duckies which are all holding big hearts, and I carry them to her and our friends group and just dump them all on her lap. Informs of Tyler and his friends and just walk away. Fast forward to her next birthday, she’s been dropping hints to Tyler about how she wants some candles form this really really really expensive place, he gents her an mint mouse plush, and she’s like “wow... thank you!” But then I walk into practice with a big basket of her favorite candles and bath bombs and she drops the plush and takes the candles, she’s so happy, her days made my days made. (Throughout this entire time period she’s been coming in my lane we have been hanging out with friends and it’s been good) fast forward to January, I here from one of my guy friends that Tyler’s planning to breakup with her, what’s more is he has been cheating on her with Patrick’s (my close friend) girlfriend. I’m conflicted I want to tell her but I just can’t bring myself to do it. So I watch as slowly the rumors leak and he breaks up with her, she is completely fine, like even smiling a bit. But she also stops talking to me, she starts leaving my lane and responds to my texts a lot more rarely now. One month later she leaves my team completely, and from there we basically stop seeing each other. This all happened around March so we come to the summer and I see her at a Swim meet, she hunts she’s been cooking a lot, and I hint that she should come over sometime. She sends me a text later that says we should hangout during the summer it takes an entire month for us to get together at my house, alone. We decide to go paddle boarding on the lake talk about what’s happened since she left. We laugh fall into the water a couple times, she of coarse looks amazing in her one piece and braids. We decide to head back and dry off I let her change in my bed room, and then she says I can come in and change and then I make a joke about her to get out because I have to change and she says “ok, ha I wasn’t planning on staying” and then leaves with a smile on her face. I change and walk upstairs where she’s waiting on the coach, we decide to watch a movie together. We decide on the other women (she choose it)  and after we watch it we decide to make salmon, we cook it together and eat it, not Awful, it’s 9pm by this time and her mom calls to say she can’t find my house, so she decides to walk to the main road, I of coarse escort her and wait with her for her mom, I made a joke about something I can’t remember what, and my crush starts talking about how this old Chinese guy was hitting on her at her brothers wedding, and I of coarse respond with a omg what! That’s awful I’d never do that to you, and as a joke and a sort of I’ll defend you thing I asked what his name and where he lived she laughed and said it was fine and she didn’t know, her mom picks her up and leaves. The last and final meetings I’ve had with her was a week ago, when I asked her out and she responded with a ya! Lets invite Riley, a mutual friend of both of ours. I say ok because I want to hangout and I like Riley. Me and Riley make it there but Allison’s late, we get to talking and I find out that Allison had asked Riley to come because she felt super awkward with just me and her there, of coarse I’m really saddened by this because I thought our last hangout went great, but I just answer with a haha ya it would have been awkward, Allison finally arrived at the mall and we go get some food we are all talking happily but I can feel that Allison doesn’t really feel comfortable talking with me, and when she does it’s kind of a humiliating tone, mocking me, like when I would say I was going to look up a random persons insta Allison said “if you can spell their name” and other insults like that. At the end of our hangout I get a text from Allison, I open my phone and expect to see a “I had a great time” or maybe a “let’s do it again” but just to see her mock me for a comment I’d made earlier. We haven’t talked since then and I have no idea what to do, on one hand this girl has kept me up at night, I think about all we could be, how much I love her and that I’d take a bullet for her.

(keep in mind hes three grades older than me (still okay age to date not creepy or anything) and we had talked for a few months but after that we hadnt talked all year) so this year the same competition that we met at rolls around so i decided to snap him, asking if he would be there.  He said he was but didnt seem like he was interested in talking to me ( also when we were talking i kinda had a huge crush on him bc i guess im a sore loser) so i hadnt seen him in a year, but the day of the competiton he snaps me asking where we were wanting to meet up, i didnt see this until after, but he found us anyways.  He comes up saying like hey, and i went in for a hug (we had talked for like those two or three months so i thought a hug was acceptable i guess) anyways he is so tall which is like a turn on and hes like super attractive omg u have no idea.  He hung out with us for like an hour or so, i kinda felt the vibe he wasnt too into the conversation because we were just like ""so whats ur band like"" etc  well he had to go but later on ( our busses were parked next to eachother) i was standing in uniform about to go perform, i was with some friends but not ones he really knew, anyways he comes up and says hi and we talk a bit, i feel like he was more comfortable with jiust me? idk  he had to go so he said bye then i began talking with my friends again until i hear him calling my name and i look up and he says good luck, so i wish it back.   it made me happy bc like this hot boy like u know talks to me (if u cant tell i dont have much experience with relationships or anything of the sort) anyways we perform, his band goes after us..  i am standing loading up our equipment, and i see his band is coming back, i am sort of waiting for him but i kinda assumed i wouldnt see him again... a few minutes later i see him coming up to me, ofc i get super excited, but keeping it cool lol. he come up and is super pissed because something went wrong with their performance, we talk a little bit and i apologize for his show going wrong, he says he has to go and says ""well i will probably never see you again in real life..."" ""yeah i guess so"" he puts his arm out for a hug and we hug (ok so this guy i so tall like the top of my head goes to like his nose) he pulls away from the hug and im llike well bye... he says ""your hair smells really nice by the way"" and im like thannks lol and we say bye and he goes off .....  and i was kinda like wow the only boy whos ever seemed remotely interested in me is graduating and lives in another state.... after he walks away this girl from my band who doesnt know him, comes up to me and says ""that guy was really hot, he hugged you AND said your hair smells good"" and i was kinda like yeah im kinda in love with him and its a problem.. and she talked to me how it looked like he was flirting with me and i was like skksksksk so at this point i was already overwhemed because this seemed like one of those senarios that i would make in my head but this one was real, so i was talking to my friend how like upsetting it was because id never see him again irl... so a while passed i was sitting on  my bus (still parked) i was talking to my friends abt this... and i get a knock on my window, i look out and my friend is outhere so i open it and look out and she is out there with this guy!!! i am like hey whats up (i dont remember eveerythign i said perfectly but you know) he says well i just wanted to say goodbye one more time so i like wave at him and he waves back and like touches my hand in a like soft high five thing lol ( i really regret not coming down there and talking bc i felt like he may have wanted to say more but idrk)  he walked away and everyone on the bus was like slsskskks and i was like shook lol.   anyways now its a few days later, i decided to snap him being like wyd bc idk it just felt llike he was interested??? but he doesnt even open snaps and acts super distant, and i cant tell if hes just a f boy or what i dont understand and i am thoroughly confused idk what i should do..

"I thought I knew what love felt like, until I met him. Such little things like waking up next to him, seeing him come home from work and fall exhausted into my arms, seeing him stare with complete confusion as he tries to decode the many dials on the oven. They're intoxicating. 

I remember when I first laid eyes on him. I thought that he was incredible. His soft, Auburn curls cascaded over his shoulders and his eyes... God those eyes. I found it too easy to be lost in the novels that they held in them. We spent hours discussing books and movies over tea yet each hour felt like a minute in his company. 

Falling asleep with him is the best part. For years I have been plagued with nightmares, gory, terrifying, unrelenting nightmares. There were times that I would wake up to the emptiness of my room screaming into the black void with nobody to console my petrified mind. Now he is there. When I wake up from a terror he does not speak because he doesn't have to. He simply pulls me close and drops small, reassuring kisses onto my neck. Suddenly I feel safe again. 

I didn't think that somebody as broken as me could ever be loved. Hurt and betrayal was all that I had come to know. I had convinced myself that is what love was because it was easier than facing the truth that I had never truly been loved. As it happens I didn't know what love was, I didn't know at all. ",romance

"In elementary, I distinctly remember a kid who had a crush on me offered to lick his finger and stick it in my ear. He called it a “white willie”, or something. Is this a thing? He seemed to consider it normal, like kissing or holding hands. ",romance
"So I am 23, turning 24 in a month, and in the middle of my last semester of college. I have never had any meaningful romantic experiences in my life, not even a kiss, and needless to say the single tag and virgin tag sit particularly heavy on me. The only thing close to a silver lining in this whole lack of experience with females is that it has given me plenty of time to sort things out and identify some key problems all the letting them get deeper seeded. 

I am confident in my looks (I'd say a 6-7 easy(not to sound like a pompous fool)) and stand 6'2. Personality wise I am often quite good at making others laugh and seem to be the type people will confide in. However, I come from a particularly hairy family and sit uncomfortably under average in penis size at around the size of a toilet paper tube. The underwhelming nature of my member is a fact about myself that left me in a deeply depressed state for a while until realizing it's not the end all be all, though, it still haunts me and greatly robs me of any and all self-esteem.

It is needless to say I consume a lot of romance based media and porn with the singular constant being that smol peened men are nothing but jokes. One of my greatest fears in finding a woman I was interested in is that I would not be able to properly satisfy her the way another man could due to my condition. The only thing apparently worse than being ill equipped is inexperience as it seems you are expected to come in hitting home runs.

As a result of the aforementioned physical insecurities as well as the rapidly decreasing regard for men in society I have acquired a number of quirks. At any given chance I will go out of my way to not even look at women out of the fear it will be taken the wrong way. I immediately assume the worse when women approach me despite logically knowing it couldnt possibly be so bad and will tense up as if I was staring down a bear. The few women I do regularly communicate with I realize I am only able to do so because they are either attached to other men or I simply view them as one of the guys.

The older I get with no experience at all with women has lead to the formation of complexes that can force me into what I could only describe as panic attacks. Ever since I was a teen I justified my own patheticness by saying that I would never  afflict myself on a woman as that would rob her of finding a better man. I might jokingly claim I am okay with becoming a wizard at 30 do to my virginity, but the reality couldnt be further from that. 

From what I can tell my window of opportunity is closing rapidly as no sane woman, from what I understand, could ever possibly want a shrimp-dicked terrified virgin as a mate the stigmas of which I feel get worse by the day.

I am okay with sharing any other information within reason, i am just looking for any advice to break the terrible mental walls i have formed and to possibly gain some light at the end of the tunnel if possible..

Also sorry if this doesnt fit under romance, i am new to reddit and will promptly delete it if i messed up",romance

"I love my wife a lot, but I have a real hard time doing creative things to show it. Earlier in the relationship, when we didn't live together, I had more time to come up (and execute) ideas. We got married, have toddlers running around the house, and I work semi-full time.

Between furthering my skills for work, being a decent father, and fixing up an old property we took on together, I feel a bit strained to do it all. Any time I have for me is between 11pm and 2am, and then if I wake up with the kids, I have no energy.

My wife oft complains that I am unromantic, that she wants to feel good. I feel like anything I do nice (whether it is take over a few chores, do nice things like light candles or give complements) is always met with a semi-sarcastic ""thaaaaanksss."" It feels like my effort was wasted and I often feel stupid for doing so. I've mentioned this before and she says that I'm stupid for thinking she doesn't like romantic things, she also tells me they don't have to be expensive (I mean, we do a -lot- together, we travel often with the kids and so on).

We do not live close to family or friends, so it is near impossible to find somebody to take the kids even for a brief amount of time, and even when we do, we simply rehash the lack of passion or romance or other ""outlier deliverable"" in our marriage, be it chores, who we think each other has a ""crush"" on, etc. It's like prime time to settle the score instead of enjoy each other's company.

Since she also called me out on not being romantic, it makes me not want to be romantic because then she'll assume I'm just doing a kneejerk and not actually being romantic or giving it thought. She is incredibly thoughtful, and is a fantastic mother, and I want to make her happy and feel good. Because of this, I'm hoping some people have ideas that do not cost much money (her request) that we can do with almost no time. It seems like the creative/functional inputs are limiting the ""romance product"" here.

I've wrote songs, made ""mix tape"" CDs, all of the high school stuff, we're a bit older now (mid 30's) and I'm trying to find better ways of connecting. TIA for reading all of this.

"Ever since we started dating, I’ve told my bf that I enjoy all of the cliché things that girls like in movies. It’s something that truly sets my heart on fire and makes me feel so special even with the smallest of details.

In the past, I have had guys send me flowers from Japan (I live in Cali) and send me flowers to my house, dedicate me songs, surprise me with random little things that remind me of them, send me letters, and whatnot.... so I’ve been used to always recieveing things like that from guys I’ve dated. 


I hate to compare, but throughout the 10 months I’ve been with my bf he has only given me flowers and surprised me a handful of times. Once on my bday, when I graduated, and only once this time I told him to pick out a flower for me. I appreciate every time he does it for me and I even tell him how much it means to me and how I feel when he gets them for me. 


However, he hardly does it. I don’t know what to do. I’m tired of giving him hints of what he should do for me. He doesn’t understand that I don’t care about how the flower looks or if they’re from the dollar store, he just doesn’t get it. 

Im his first official girlfriend, the other 3 were just girls he was basically friends with benefits with. None of them were like me according to him, as in they didn’t expect the little cute stuff from him. I told him of course not. I’m different from them and he needs to learn to be more of what I like. 


Throughout our relationship I feel like i always give more. I have given him my all... literally. I lost it to him and I don’t regret it one bit. I really do love him, and he knows how much of a big step it was for me and our relationship. On his birthday I surprised him with friends which is something no one has ever done for him. I always pick him up (he doesn’t have a car rn) and go with him to places like 2 hours away. I always text him whenever I get the chance and ask him about his day and stuff. I always compliment him and tell him how lucky I am to have him.... but i feel like that isn’t enough for him to understand I need more of that. Our conversations through text are dry, when we’re out together he takes out his phone although I tell him how much it bothers me . 


I broke up with him once before in the beginning of our relationship because he wasn’t putting effort, and I feel like he’s doing the same now. I’m super sad and I wish he would do the romantic things I’m used to. It’s a big part of a relationship for me and I’ve stressed it to him but he seems to forget it. Any advice ?",romance

Keep in mind I have never seen this guy before and we had a 30 second conversation. He texted me asking again if I was free tomorrow.  What do I do now???

I'm not sure where I'm going wrong but I can already feel the pattern beginning with my new boyfriend. He was besotted the first year and now is seeming less into long term commitment than he was. I just think it's a matter of time until he moves on and settles down with someone else.

"I'll lay the situation out simply.

I'm a male introvert in my early twenties and I had a close best friend with benefits relationship with a guy in his mid thirties. We hung out together, watched shows together, slept in the same bed, etc. At the start of the relationship I had told him I wasn't looking to date anyone until I was a little older, and I don't date guys (just never had romantic feelings for guys). He is completely gay and developed romantic feelings toward me I explained to him I just didn't have the ability to reciprocate those feelings. We have known each other for about 2 years.

The problem is this...

I recently started dating again and I'm hanging out with a cute girl who I'm very likely to start a romantic relationship with. I recently brought her over to the house, I introduced her to him, etc. After dinner and drinks had settled down, we went off to the guest bedroom and he went off to the main bedroom. Needless to say, we were enjoying each-other's company in the guest room but it was blazing hot. I went over to the main room (which has full AC), and asked if we could barrow it for all of 30-40 minutes. (Before you think this is a little weird of a request, he constantly mentions the house we live in as our property, etc. So he thinks of it as our bedroom. And he also uses the room with other people for the same thing the girl and I would be doing.). I told him it was totally fine if he didn't feel comfortable with it... He agreed, got his stuff, and we all switched rooms... Fast forward about 30 minutes and we get dressed, and I go over to get him. He looks somewhat sad, so I tell him the room is clear and clean for him to go back over there. He replies with it's in use etc. I go back to the room, repeat 30 minutes later tried again... same response. No eye contact. Nothing. We decided to give him some space because he might be a little upset from the sudden request or maybe some third party thing.

Fast forward to this morning...

We slept in, woke up, chatted for a bit, then I went over to check on him and he was playing a game on his phone. I say hello and the usual, and he doesn't really respond. I sat down on the bed with him and asked him if he was feeling okay ... he just responded ""it doesn't matter""... I told him he can have the room... we were fine with him having it from the moment in the night before. He just said ""you still have someone over""... He never made eye contact. He just looked so sad. I may have feelings for him as a lover, but he is my best friend. I hate seeing him like this, but I have no idea how to help him. I don't want him to slip into a suicidal depression. I think he feels like I was his last real relationship and that I'm going to abandon him, despite all the things I've told him counter to that.

If anyone knows something or some approach, I would really appreciate the insight and help. He is an introverted gamer, who likes in general nerdy things, food, and anime. I just don't want to lose my best friend while trying to start the steps to having a family...

"Sorry for the novel but I have been trying to figure out how to say this for years. 
I wish I could have made you happy. 

I remember one of the first times we ever hung out together, we decided we were going to be running buddies. That didn't last but we had a conversation about how the men in your life tend to become addicted to you and then attached in an embarrassingly clingy way. Fast forward and...

We slept together a handful of times between my loft and my bull St house and I tried unbelievably hard to not show how I felt. I refused to fall for you because I didn't think it would end well and couldn't deal with losing any part of you. As a friend you are creative, spontaneous, adventurous and bold. As a lover you are as graceful as anything I could imagine, like a swan in the moonlight. My absolute definition of beautiful. 

Years ago, when you came to see me in New York, we went out with a friend of mine. I went to get drinks and when I came back you were in the bathroom. I sat down and he said ""my God she loves you!..."". No matter how many times I asked, Liam refused to ever tell me what he meant by it. The only thing he would tell me is that it had to do with something you said. Maybe he lied I don't know. However, immediately I remembered what you told me when we were jogging and became scared that I would lose you. 

Funny thing is that I fell for you back during our brief attempt at the running lifestyle. Unfortunately, I wouldn't let myself say anything because I was afraid you would run away thinking that I was just another one of the guys that caught feelings and was obsessed. 

Our time together in DC was an immense amount of fun however, I felt a significant amount of sadness coming off of you and it killed me that I couldn't make you happy. Holly, you are still every bit the graceful swan that I remember and grew to love in all aspects (mind, body and soul). 

I love you!
I wish that at some point we ever found a groove because you are perfect and I hope that one day someone makes feel as perfect as you are. 


You probably won't respond and that's ok. Most of the time when this much information comes in all at once it's rather overwhelming. But like I said, this had taken me a rather long time to word correctly and have the courage to even put into words. So, do with it what you will. 

Miss you Bawls. ",romance
"The raunchy clip, which is believed to have been filmed at a branch in Italy, has gone viral after being posted on Instagram.

The video, shot by a fellow customer shows the man standing close  behind his girlfriend with her dress pulled up around her waist,  exposing her bare bottom. As the burgers and fries are delivered, the  pair begin rubbing up against each other. Once the food arrives, the  man stops grinding against the woman and she quickly pulls down her  dress.

"This has occurred in the beginning of our relationship where a new friend of his texted him this, I think we should date lol. I told him I felt comfortable with him being friends with her because 1. She knew that we were together at this point. 2. Was just going through a break up. Recently I confronted her about it because she was mad that I blocked her on Facebook even though we had never interacted. She proceeded to ask my boyfriend why I blocked her and asking what she did wrong. During the confrontation, she admitted trying to get at my boyfriend and is now trying to get us to go on double dates with her new boyfriend. 

I told my boyfriend and her and that I don’t want to be friends with her. My boyfriend is thinking that she’s innocent and socially awkward for the whole comment thing, but she knew what she was doing. I don’t know how to handle this situation. 

Any advice?",romance
"I found this girl on match, and she had her email in her profile. I went a ahead and emailed her, we have been in almost continuous communication for 3 weeks. She has shared details about her life, that she is either a novelist, that has created a very deep world, or she is real. I have tried testing her on very asspects of her life, she told me very early on, by casually mentioning things or asking questions and she always gets it right everytime. But I want to confirm her identity, and the pictures she is sending. I'm sure she is thinking the same thing. Have any ideas?",romance
"Me male 35 her female 28

Tldr is she into me or do Greek women just behave this way.

Are greek woman naturally more touchy feely? A work colleague seems very comfortable with being close to me and often puts her hand on mine when talking, sometimes even my leg. She has not always been like this but i could put it down to her being more comfortable with me as we have become more freindly. I have not noticed her like this with anyone else.
  Desperately don't want to read it wrong and make fool of myself!  There are other things she has done that make me thinks maybe its more than just being friendly. Catch her looking and smiling at me a lot, she brings in food she has made at home to share with me at lunch. And it seems like she puts herself forward to work with me on a lot of projects. 

Thoughts?

Thanks !",romance
"I’ve been living with this person for a while now. It started off entirely innocent. Years ago, she had an apartment next to the college I had just enrolled to and needed a roommate so it seemed perfect. A lot happened. My girlfriend at the time left me for someone else, so I was, extremely depressed. Time went by. She graduated.I flunked out. But we were good friends by this point so we decided to live together again. Another blissful year went by and she decided to teach in another country, but we never lost touch. We talked constantly. Meanwhile I began to heal from my last relationship, and am currently, entirely past it. A year later, she cane back and we’re living together again, only this time I think I want to be more than a friend. I know her, she doesn’t want a relationship, and I honestly don’t either. Love is fluid, we both take things as they come. She’s beautiful. Even objectively, she’s attractive to a large majority. I’m ok. I might be hard on myself, and I definitely look unique, dark skinned with hazel eyes.  But she’s gorgeous, the most beautiful person I’ve ever seen. Mixed with green eyes that will melt your soul. We’re living together again and she’s doing fantastic. She just became a teacher. I’m not doing so great. Recently I think I’ve accepted that I’m in love with her. It hit me like a brick shithouse, and here I am, entirely unsure of what to do. I want to tell her I love her. And I do, unconditionally. I don’t need her to be with me, as long as she’s in my life I’ll be ok. I’m strong, strong enough to truly love her, even when it hurts. But I won’t forgive myself if I never try. I’m not afraid of rejection, I expect it to some degree, but im simply not good enough for her. Not yet. She’s...amazing. I want to be too for both of us, and I believe I will be. She’s the sort of person that drives one to greatness so I’m optimistic of the future...at least in that regard. I’ve decided to tell her exactly how I feel. That I’m more than a best friend.  That I someone to consider. Someone she can love. But I’m terrified. I’m strong enough to lose her, but I’ll do anything to keep her, even as a friend. Even as her lowest friend I will endure for her. I must tell her. I won’t betray my feelings even if it brings great suffering. But even so I don’t know how to tell her. I don’t want to lose her as a friend for both of our sakes. We do love each other and we do need each other just not exclusively in “that” way. Ultimately I’m going to tell her. It would be up a betrayal of my own soul not to. But it never hurts to seek the guidance of others. So please, I am entirely open to your beliefs, opinions, and experiences. Maybe it will help, bit it absolutely will not hurt. So please let me know what you think. I have no set date to tell her but I feel like I must soon. I can’t Contain this for so much longer. For better or worse I must be entirely honest if not for her but myself. In the meantime there is great wisdom in the world and I wish to hear whatever I can. Thank you in advance. Made great fortune bless us all. 

Update: 

          I told her. I haven’t been home for work recently and I won’t be back again until this Thursday, but I had one day where I had time to come back home to see her. I figured not seeing each other for a few days afterwards would give us a lot of time to process everything. Anyway we hung out like always but started talking a little more seriously. She’s been thinking and in three years she wants to move out out NYC. We’ve talked about leaving for a while and I’m all for it, but I need to get myself together first, and so I was considering moving next year to finish school. I have some family I’ve recently reconnected with and so I think it would be my best chance of finishing. She was understandably upset. She wants to be with me for as long as possible but knows I need to achieve the things that are important to me. Long term it’s for the best, the more established I am, the more likely I’ll be able to be with her where ever she goes. We told each other how much we love each other and then I left, thinking that it wasn’t a good time to bring this up as well. On my way to the train station she texted me a few times how much she loves me and how important I am to her. I couldn’t wait anymore, I thought this would be as good of a time as any so I can back to talk to her. I explained as much as I could. How I had been feeling lately, why I might have been acting a little bit off, and then I told I loved her, that I was in love her. And, well, she sort of already knew. In hindsight it may have been fairly obvious, I’m not the best at hiding my feelings. We talked about where we were in life, where I was, how  I can be a little hard on myself. We talked a lot about each other but not as much about “us” as I’d hoped. She asked me if I wanted to date her and I said no not now. Which is true, I don’t right now, but eventually yes. I do love her, platonically, and romantically. We agreed that if it’s meant to be it will happen. I told her this doesn’t need to change anything, that I have no expectations of her reciprocating any of these feelings. I should’ve ended here but I felt like I had to do something for her to take me seriously, something to break the boundary of what we already had. So I kissed her...and I really shouldn’t have. I was selfish. I had time to think about this, I knew this was a boundary I wanted to cross. This was all just thrown at her, she didn’t have time to process this all and it just confused her. She’s crossed this boundary with other friends before and something worse has always followed. She said she doesn’t like when things are foggy, that it couldn’t happen again. We talked a little more and told each other how much we love each other and I left. I don’t regret telling her, I don’t even regret kissing her. It honestly played out more or less how I thought it would and I thought I would feel better afterwards, for accepting my feeling, for being entirely honest...but I feel horrible. It feels like a breakup, it feels like I’m in love with someone that can’t love me back. It feels like like my hearts broken, again. I’m glad it will be a few days before I see her again, I need to process and grieve. I do love her unconditionally, I will be with her for the rest of my life regardless of what our relationship is. But fuck, I’m going to suffer, at least for a while. Watching her be with other people, trying to fall in love with someone else, trying to maintain our relationship while looking her in the eye without showing her how much I still love and want her... it’s going to be hell. But I’ve been through this once, I can do it again. I’m staying focused. I’m exercising regularly, I’m staying healthy, I’m getting a better job, I’m writing, I’m pursuing my passions, I’m living. But I don’t know what to do next. Do I pretend this never happened just get through this until it doesn’t hurt as badly? Do I hold on to hope? Do I go on believing that if I achieve all I want and show her I can be a lover, that she’ll see me this way?Do I leave, something I could do so easily even though I promised her I never would? Or do I simply try not to love her that way anymore, is that even possible, to purposely fall out of love with someone. I’m just hurt, I’m confused, and it feels like there’s no real solution to this. It feels like no matter what I’m loosing some part of her and some part of myself. I appreciate all of the support everyone has given me through this. Please share your thoughts, tell me your stories, your wisdom and guidance inspire me. Thank you.

"Ok so my ex broke up with me about two months ago (it was a 2 and a half year relationship and we were extremely close) and last week on of my really good guy friends hit me with the ""I'm falling in love with you"" and I just completely shut down and broke down crying when he told me... is that normal?",romance
"Okay - I'll say it out loud - I lack creativity. But she's has told me in the past that she would want a proposal that sweeps her off the floor.

She's the love of my life and I know even if I do it theost dull way she's going to say yes but I want to make that effort and hence, I'm here to tap the collective mind of the hive.

How can I make it so that it's the most romantic day of her life?

***Update***: So here's what's going to happen - I am doing it this weekend. Taking her to a semi-private beach during the golder hour. Will set up a canopy there which will be lit with tiny lights (she loves them) with an iconic structure of the city and ocean in the background. Will light up the entire place with artificial battery operated candles. I am planning a small table with a flower pot near the canopy and a couple of wine glasses. A friend will bring her to me and I will ask :)

Will have some light music and I am right now working on my proposal speech. Will take pictures of the thing and share if feasible.

Everyone who took the time out to post - THANK YOU! Much appreciated.",romance
"She floated across the pavement like a lily in the wind.  I notice these things.  Twisting and twirling, spinning, flipping, throwing rings of gold and fire.  I remain locked, captivated by her effervescent and graceful fluid motions.  It’s the music, captivating her, carrying her through the drifts in the air as if she needed these breezes to guide her.  They brought her here, the angels.  She knew it too, and I knew it just as they had brought me in the same way, right to her.

He was super respectful of my boundaries and we’re still friends to this day. Now that I’m out of my relationship I'm starting to have feelings for him, but I also know I’m not over my ex yet.

Just as he is about to move his hand away from my face, I put my hand over his so that his hand is cupping my face. I can't help myself from pulling him in closer – *oh well*, I think to myself – *it's just lipstick that can be reapplied*.  ",romance

There's so much romance that keeps you waiting pushing all this uninteresting filler down your throat to the point where you stop caring about the relationship at some point and you just get bored yet you continue to watch/read for the promised ending. some cliffhangers and conflict is obviously okay and necessary but for example, some mangas will drag out the romance for 100 chapters only for it to end with a kiss or a sex scene which has lost all flare at that point. any recommendations?",romance

"We’ve been together for four months, but it already feels like it’ll last a lifetime. I moved in with him last month and have not since looked back.

He’s not necessarily a romantic person, but it doesn’t stop him from trying. The first time he awkwardly handed me a gift with a mumble of ‘this is for you’ made my heart literally leap high into the sky. In my life I’ve never had a boyfriend that gives me presents (small things, not expensive, which I find even sweeter), that actually does something if I ask, and strives to make me happy. 

He may not be perfect, but he’s the closest thing there is. I seriously contemplated our future and I am not breaking out in a cold sweat whenever I think of marriage or babies with this man. This is a first for me. 

He truly cares for me. I feel respected, yet protected. I even feel loved. Outside of my immediate family, he is the most important person to me. I love him so much. I strive to make him as happy as he makes me, but it never feels enough.

I’ve never been as happy as I am in this moment, as I think of him. I then feel sad as I remember I am flying back to my home country for a month to see my family. This was planned before we even met. I will miss him so much. He said he will miss me too. He’s coming with me to the airport and is going to stay with me until I need to go through security. 

I wish he could come with me, or at least visit. We were planning a weekend where he could come and meet everyone, but he just got promoted in his job and is still settling into his new role. We have decided *together* that we will book a weekend in September, when kids are back at school, and we can go to a hotel somewhere and do some tourism while he gets to know my parents. 

I love him so much that I could burst! ❤️",romance
"There's a crush I've had (more of an obsession now) since January. When I say that he's the man of my dreams, he's absolutely perfect (read below what my definition of that ). He graduated this year and I'm got extremely upset at myself for not getting to know him better after the year ended.  I've been through an extreme amount of things in life and oddly enough, not trying harder to be friends with him is my biggest regret. I've never met someone like him. I don't really crush on people because they all feel the same to me nowadays (and can't keep their fucking eyes off their phones for a second). I did attempt to come out of my shell and become friends with him and we joked around in class and he was always very encouraging nice and always reminded me to speak up. I eventually got the courage to ask him to go for a walk and I ended up walking him back to his dorm about 20 minutes away. I found out a lot about him including his real first name (he gave me the name he prefers to be called be he doesn't like his own), where he's from, and I played along with all of his strange antics and jokes. I had meant to ask him for his number, but shied away from doing so.  About a week after that encounter, he stopped talking to me, moved seats and purposefully avoided me at all times. I had no clue what I had done wrong and I managed to stop and ask him once and he said that I began distracting him and I was a bit too fun during class. I said okay, thinking we were on good terms, but when went back to avoidance and all again. I even bought food in because I missed a party and he refused to eat any of it. I have no idea what in the world I could've done wrong. So we pretty much ended off on silent and bad terms. During the last month of the class, I began trying to find information on him, but I only had his first name to go off. About 4 weeks into my searching I ended up finding his full name, phone number (which I later found out was the house's landline), his address, his family members' names, who he lives with, his father's business, and his facebook profile that he doesn't really check. 3 weeks ago, I found out where he went at the end of his summer job last year and figured he would be there this year again (carnival)(found out today that he's working the same one). I would like to go to the duration of the carnival and wait out for him.  It's pretty much the only chance I have left at getting to know him. I was wondering if i should do it or not. Please let me know your opinion.

Me and him are planning to start video chatting very soon. I’ve heard his voice before and his accent is amazing! We’re both the same age, and he makes me really happy. He has told me before I make him happy too, sometimes when I send him motivational snapchats that are supposed to make him feel happier he screenshots them to look back on when he feels upset. 

I know he is really lonely and complains about his friends having girlfriends and not him, he has told me before things like “if I had to wait for something I don’t mind” and I’m not sure what this would mean! 

I don’t know how to tell him I have feelings for him, I’m waiting for him to tell me. I’m scared of the distance, and I’m terrified he’ll find somebody else much better where he lives.",romance
" Hi, I am a 24 year old male working in a corporate. I have this huge crush on a colleague of mine, who doesn't work with our company but a sister concern. She works on the same floor as us, initially we merely exchanged smiles but over time we started talking with Good mornings &amp; see you's. I slowly started having conversations with her, realised that she looks good and talks even better. I am really interested in this woman but the only trouble for me is that her schedule is so messed up that she turns up to work like 3 days a week or sometimes even 2. Another complication is that she's 42 years old, thats right. She's 18 years older to me but she isn't married. She is a single woman and she even told me that she's happy to be so. Given that both of us are single, I don't see age as a huge problem. Also I just don't know how to take this to the next level as we have been having 10 minute conversations whenever we see each other and that's it. I want to go a step further as its been this way for weeks now. What do you guys suggest, how do I make a move? I had this chance to exchange numbers with her and she took note of my number. She said she would text me when she's free but she never did get back. This was like a couple of days ago and she told me she was really busy. So I don't want to overthink and take it as a sign that she isn't interested. What do you guys think and what do you suggest? She talks damn well when she does but opportunities are so low. ",romance

"I don't write. Like, at all. But today's activities had me inspired.

---------------------------------------------------------------

I had been dating this woman for a total of 4 days before the idea first popped into my mind. ""I love her."" It was a spontaneous and foreign thought.""It's way too early for that. Knock it off!"" Though I had known Reese for 4 years at that time, we were less than a week into our courtship and logic told me that these feelings were premature, and therefore unsubstantiated. I tried to reason with myself. ""This is just you feeling 'less alone.' Someone paying you attention shouldn't be akin to love."" Yet the feeling persisted. 

I was uncomfortable at the notion that another person could make me feel this way, but what caught me most off-guard was the fact that nothing particularly romantic was happening at the time. In fact, we were simply exchanging the most unflattering pictures we could take of ourselves while going about our separate lives. The time and place didn't seem appropriate for such a realization, yet the feeling persisted.

I allowed myself to dive deeper into this thought process as the rest of my 12 hour night shift droned on. She, in fact, had been the one encouraging me to become more in-touch with myself. 

Being on opposite schedules limited our opportunity for interactions, and being 120 miles from each other offered a unique perspective. Was I romanticizing the bond? Did I even know what it meant to love someone? I tried to convince myself that missing someone and loving her are two different things. But... The feeling persisted.",romance
"There’s this guy.... he’s so mysterious. Super confident but my girl friends say he’s a fuckboy.... I don’t think so though. He’s always such a gentleman to me and my friends notice as well. There was this one time I walked into my class and then he walked in. I had just sat down and he walks behind me but then stops, he starts to touch my hair. I’m flattered but confused. “You had something in your hair” he smiles at me then walks to his seat. A minute later he caught me gazing at him and just smiled and waved. ♥️*heart melts*♥️But he can be such a jerk when his friends are around... However, there was this one time I accidentally sat at the wrong table at breakfast with total strangers 😬ikr😬 and his friend said something snarky to me when I moved to the other table with my friends.  Then he looked at his friend and said “hey leave her alone, she’s just fine” and I’m like freeeeaking out in my head. Also some other guy came up to me and asked me out, I said “oh um, that’s sweet, but no thank you” and he (main guy) looked at me and winked... IM LIKE WTH........ and then about a week later I was about to sit down in class and he walked in behind me and pushed my chair in, forcing me to sit down, and said “there ya slow poke” and his tone is so hard to understand like is he making fun of me or being flirty 😫😫😫 I probably won’t see him til the next school year tho someone please HELP ME I like him so much but I don’t want to get my hopes up... (And he’s super hot😍😍)",romance

"Why? I just don't get it. Why is it so hard to find someone that loves me for me? I fall in love with almost every other nerdy/geek female. I fell in love in the matter of 4 days. I'm 26 and I put my heart and soul into a lot of these girls, meet them, date for a bit, and they are always the ones that aren't ready. They wanted this, they wanted to go and get a BF but then they ditch me. I fall on my face, cry my eyes out and can't speak cause no one wants me for me. What is so hard about this?",romance
"Don’t we all love those unexpected ‘I love you’ messages that light up our face every time we see them in our dull mundane life?  Words have the power to warm up our heart every time we hear or see them, it makes us feel special and loved. How about spicing up a regular day with just small DIY cute notes!

A sticky note &amp; a pen is all you need for him to start his day with a broad smile! Write a cute note on a paper and stick it on the Desk, bathroom glass or wherever his sight does first! ❤

"When ignorance wasn’t bliss. 

      5th grade- I wasn’t a cute kid. Not ugly per say, but ordinary. I remember the twenty minute walk home from the train, with my face in a book. My little brothers bickered ahead of me. I drove through stinging nettle patches on my bike with my them. We climbed trees... you get it. Late bloomer. I didn’t notice that I wasn’t unnoticed, and therefore I was unaware. Ignorance is bliss right? Maybe in this case, perhaps not. 
I had always little crushes on guys for as long as I can remember. I was sheltered, and naive, however. Nothing came of anything...

      That is until the new guy came to my little private school. Not just any dude. Imagine a non sociopathic version of Zack Morris from Saved By the Bell. Even better- imagine Leo from Titanic, minus the whole dying thing. Just the first tape...He was dreamy. He was witty, charismatic, best of all, a wonderful artist. He was a cool middle school kid, as I was just a 5th grader. He was in 7th grade. He had dirty blonde hair, blue eyes and a brilliant smile. He was Julian. I’d sneak through his files in art class. My hands would shake, and I’d stare in awe at his work. He was perfect. 

      I noticed that after school, he didn’t typically take the underground like everyone else had. He walked another way, and would then disappear. I had to find out where he was going. It was my little twelve year old dream that he would walk with me there, to the train, (or his secret place) and hold my hand. I hatched a plan. My then only real friend outside of school was recruited to stalk this kid with me, along with my youngest brother. It’s oddly easy to follow someone in a city. It is smarter to do so when familiar with the area. 

      He, and his friends turned a corner, as we followed from a distance. Naturally, my heart pounded. We giggled and speculated all the secret things he could’ve been doing. There was a brick arch way that turned into a small flowery court yard. I peered around it, and saw him smoking a cigarette... ‘There’s his little secret,’ I thought. My naive brain was rattled. Not that he smoked, but that his older brother noticed me. The whole group, including Julian, saw me. There was no point in hiding, and no way of being able to casually pass through the court yard. It was a dead end. 

      “Hey Nicole,” he said, slightly confused. Still friendly, and so charming. 

Nicole Autopilot:

      “Hey Julian... you know, it’s crazy- my brother ran away...and I was just looking for him.”  The embarrassment radiated through me- like it had been injected directly through my veins.

      “Isn’t that your brother right there?” Julian nodded knowingly towards him- My brother stared blankly... 

“Yes, yes...that’s him, I’ve found him.” 

      I wrote all about the hilarity, and humiliation in my diary that night. My head spun. ‘Now he knows I like him-so screwed.’ 





Part 2 - One year goes by- 

      Sixth grade rolled around, and I couldn’t wait to see him again. I even pondered about him in my diary that hot, un-air-conditioned summer. When school started, I walked by him, standing coolly with his friends. Our eyes locked, it hurt to look at him. I walked on- he watched me pass by. I could hardly feel my legs carry me.

Nicole autopilot. 

      During school enrollment period, was the first time I ever saw him. I remember how he walked, I couldn’t believe this gorgeous Austrian boy I had witnessed. I couldn’t look back up at him. It seared my blown eye sockets when his eyes met mine. I could smell him as he breezed by. My ears went hot. I outed the idea of him quickly. The school was small. ‘Every girl will be all over him,’ I thought. I just knew there would be no way. I was very right. Girls would gush about him, not only at school, but to my own 13th birthday party. I went with a lot of girls from school to paddle boat on the Danube river. They wouldn’t have spoken to me, had there not been an occasion to do something. Plus, I was allowed out of the house. Teen goals... 

      We laughed on the water. Topic Julian came up, and I froze. It was another American girl much more developed, and less naive than I. Molly, along with several others admitted to liking him. They spoke of all their magical encounters with him. I sat there paralyzed. In the autumn Austrian sun, I played it off until the fan-girling fest was over. I cringed every time his name came up, unless it was one of the hundred times I’d written about him in my diary. I didn’t know how to take this infatuation of mine. 


      This year was different. I started wearing lipstick and mascara. My body changed from lanky to shapely/slender. In my mind, I was still just a kid, but hormones were kicking in quickly. Boys called out to me in the city. Love notes, and poems came my way. Still a total nervous, dorky mess in my mind. The attention took me by surprise.

      I remember the first time Julian spoke to me. He made me laugh, but so insanely nervous. ‘Surely, he’s fucking with me,’ I thought. I started seeing him more, and I would look forward to passing him in the hall after art class. “Hey Nicole!” He said. Being the stubborn ass that I was, I walked on. He was never short of female attention, why me? 

      My International private school separated boys and girls physical ed. Our school didn’t have a gymnasium. The rented fields were a good 15 Minute walk away. This was a rare time in which we weren’t supervised. The walks to and from the field was everyone’s fun time to talk about whatever we wanted. I should say whatever ‘they’ wanted, because sometimes, I’d walk with my one friend. I commonly walked alone. 

      Julian caught up to me from these walks. We would talk about where we were from, and whatever else. It shook me completely. He was 2 years older than myself, and clearly less naive. He would slide his finger over the back of my bra. Putting on my act, mixed with being paralyzed, 

Autopilot 

      I rolled my eyes. I couldn’t believe he was paying attention to me. He was a funny guy, and I was still awkward and weird. I still had to show him I wasn’t like the rest of his fan club. I secretly savored every bit of his attention. He was just so cool. Too cool for me. Not just conventionally cool. Savvy, confident, and ingenious. Our last phys-ed walk that I remember, he held my hand. It was a truly beautiful walk. Just like a movie, my dream came true. He held my trembling hand. I worried he’d noticed. My life long bully followed behind, hitting me in the ankles with a hockey stick. I didn’t feel it. Julian held my hand. 

      I still never let on. I basically secretly played our interactions in my head over, and over. I fantasized about him in any way that my pre pubescent mind could. He gave me a reason not to hate school. I had few friends, and didn’t do well in general. 

      He was so smooth. It was time for phys ed, and I headed down the large, old stair case towards the exit. I smelled him behind me. Only God in Heaven knows what scent he wore, because I swear, that’s where it came from. Before I could fall down the stairs, (simply from the mini panic attack of his presence) I felt a light touch on my shoulder. From behind me, he moved his hands in a way from my neck down to my ankles, mimicking an hour glass, hardly touching me. Kid had moves... I continued down the stairs, clinging to the old railing for dear life.

      I once left my diary (full of his name) at his bus stop. In horror, I grabbed my little brother’s hand, jumped off the metro, and sprinted back. I cried, and just knew he’d find it. Somehow, I found it where I’d left it. There, in it’s floral pattern, it sat neatly on a wooden bench seemingly untouched. Interestingly, being at his bus stop was the only attempt I’d ever made to approach him. Not out of spite, but when I finally had the nerve- he was never there. 

      Toward the middle of the year, there was talk of certain Austrian students having to leave the private school. My heart sunk. It was true after all. It turned out to be a technicality of accreditation. Julian came to school less and less. I still didn’t have what it took to hide my grief. I rarely spotted him after school, but the last day he attended. I was on my usual way to the subway when he caught up with me. My friends walked ahead, the path was narrow. Before I could get the nerve to ask him if I’d ever see him again, I completely ruined it. 

      Julian slowly moved his body towards mine, as we were pressed against an old brick wall. I’ll never forget how close he was to me- I’d never been close to any man like that. My ears rung, and I was on fire. I remember the cold brick on my back, and his scent. Fire and ice surged throughout me. I looked down, and nervously laughed. When I looked up, he went to kiss me. To this day, I’ll never know why, but I slapped him. He immediately walked ahead with everyone else, and wouldn’t look at me. It was as though it’d all happened in less than a second. I didn’t know he was kissing me. I didn’t have the time to process what had just happened. Before I could apologize, his train came, and I never saw him again. Sort of...

      Some time later, perhaps a year or even more, my school held an event. He was long gone. Never from my mind, but it had been some time since his departure. I suppose we’d grown up a lot. I didn’t know he was there, until the event was over. The school gossip informed me that he was outside. Unsure why to this day, but my only reaction was ‘why.’ I couldn’t stop wondering why he attended, while I face checked myself before seeing him.  The cold Austrian chill jacked me in the face, as most days, and my hair flew back as I exited the building to ‘leave,’ (aka see him.) This would be my last chance, and I knew it. Then, there he was, cool as ever. He wasn’t animated though, I couldn’t say hello. His demeanor was different. It was defeated. Maybe perhaps even resentful. I’d slapped him after all. I don’t know why I’d assumed that he’d conveniently forget about the whole, slapping thing. I’ll always wonder why he’d looked solemn that night. I didn’t think it was because of me. I wondered a lot about everything, but specifically him. The first guy that ever noticed me. I remember so much, that I’ve become accustomed to people not remembering what I remember. It was charming. Sad, but charming. Just like the very last time I saw him. I’ve always felt in tune with other’s feelings. It took a lot of years to truly process what happened; to this day, I still wonder. I nonchalantly waved at a distance, as I made my way to the tram. He watched coldly as I disappeared from the corner to the tram. 

I was 16, school friend and I were flipping through Maxim mag on the subway. I stumbled across an Axe ad. 

 “This could be Julian,” I laughed at my horrid eyesight. Haley snatched my copy.

“That is Julian.” 

He is now a brilliant artist in his field.

"As I find myself feeling lost in these long uneventful days without her, I still can’t seem to stop thinking of how lucky I was to spend the short amount of time I was able too with her. I’m usually not one for the heartbreak stuff and expressing my feelings especially when it makes me vulnerable but this girl she broke down that wall. I used to be the guy who didn’t believe in love anymore. I never was one to fall relatively easy as it was. Usually when things ended with a girl I moved on and didn’t look back and honestly didn’t care. I didn’t think that there was ‘the one’ or a soulmate. Because how could there be just one person who is meant for someone with all these people in the world? I’ve had my shares of heartbreak even as far as being engaged and it ending because of an affair. This one though, this one hit hard and hurt bad. 

It was one of those moments that you think back on and wonder how it even happened. One of those nights where you are working until almost 11pm on a Saturday night, all you want to do is go home shower and hit the bed. That was my typical Saturday night. I get a phone call from my best friend who moved out of state a while back so when we are in each others area we try to catch up. He happened to be down in my hometown for the weekend and told me to come out with him. I hesitated because I was exhausted and I know the nights him and I have when we are together…holy hell. None the less I meet up with him and he is with a (girl) friend of his and her two friends and there she was….

There she was standing there all 5 foot of her, deep brown eyes, hair a mess from a long day of partying but still cuter than any girl in that place. Standing in a corner in the back of the bar by the pool table. We were introduced, she commented on a tattoo of mine and that was that. As the group moved to the dance floor I think that’s when I actually got hooked. She started dancing and rapping to some song which now after knowing her she probably didn’t know half of the words but still nailed it, all eyes on her. It was exactly what I’ve been looking for in a partner. Someone who can have a great time and not care what others thought. We ended up going to the casino and I ended up back at her hotel. The next day I contacted her on social media and sent her my number…up until a couple weeks ago we talked every day and I couldn’t even tell you half the things we talked about. There were times I would have a Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Text message notifications within minutes of each other and vice versa. i can honestly say she was my everything for those 3 months and me meeting her was the best thing that happened to me. She made me fall. Fall hard and quick. 

I know it sounds absolutely crazy that in that short amount of time someone can feel the way i feel about you. All i can say to y'all is you haven't met her. And to the lucky ones who have gotten a chance, will get a chance and will get another chance to make her yours understand what you have. Not everyone is as lucky as us to come across someone like this. So appreciate her…everything about her and don’t let her go because you will regret it. 

Let her be the weird goofball that she is. She’s gonna wanna dance like theres no tomorrow or until she starts complaining about her feet hurting because she loves wearing cute heels and sexy shoes. “It’s hard being a girl.” There may be times when you are walking in the mall or outside and the music is playing, most likely she’s gonna have the urge to sing it or dance a little too it. NO matter who is watching or how many people are there…embrace it and join her. Be a goof with her. Be weird together. Remember she's choosing to be that way with you and because when you are with her it shouldn’t matter. Its just you and her and those random strangers watching you are just happen to be in the right place at the right time to witness a connection like that.

She sometimes likes to cause scenes in public…not the scenes you are thinking about. She’ll start arguing over something that is completely made up just to make you uncomfortable and others reactions but she’s completely joking. You can either look at her like she’s crazy, be embarssed and walk out or you can go along with it. Don't walk out. Admit that you are wrong in whatever she is yelling about or deny it, but keep going. Whatever story she comes up with to a stranger and includes you in it…go with it. She once told a stranger on our second date that we had a child together….our story went on for about 15 minutes. 15 minutes of not knowing what the other one was going to add to the story. We still laughed about weeks later. After you walk out you won’t be able to stop laughing about it. Thats who she is. For most people that could be too much but why? Life is to dull as it is we need someone who is always going to keep it fresh and fun. If you can’t handle a little embarrassment she’s not the one for you! She loves it. She can also take it too. 

She is like no\-one I’ve ever met before. In the time that we talked and saw each other I always wondered and often mentioned how I didn’t understand how nobody could want to be with her and how the ones who had a chance to be with her let her go. Her response was always either, i don’t know, they all end up hating me or they couldn’t handle me. So she wants to go out sometimes and close the bar down and dance till the lights come on. Sometimes she just wants to go out with coworkers or her girlfriends. She is a the type of girl who likes commitment and having someone every night but also is independent and needs her own time and space. Chances are shed rather spend the night with you watching a movie or show then going out and partying, but when she does want to go out you have to be okay with it and let her have her fun. She will be back. 

She’s the girl you want around your friends. They love her. It’ll get to a point to where they invite you out or to do something and they ask if she’s coming. You can wander off for a few minutes knowing that she is perfectly comfortable talking to your friends and carrying on a conversation without you up her ass and vice versa. She'll make fun of you along with them and even start some of it. In fact its almost like she’s known them for ever when she mingles with them. She cares about your friends and who they are. Honestly she is the first girl who before she met my friends, when i would talk about them she asked to see what they look like so she knows who I’m talking about when i talk about them. It may sound stupid but for me that shows that she actually does care about you and your friends.

She makes you feel like you can tell her anything and it feels so good when you do. She’ll be your best friend. She’ll be the first thing you think of when you wake up and the last thing you think of before you fall asleep and everything in between. This girl will drive you crazy. Make you feel like you never thought you could feel. When you lose her you will feel like there is nothing left…and just lost. Don’t lose her. Don’t give her away. Love her. Love her hard, every day. Love her for EVERYTHING that she is. The cute. The Sexy. The beautiful. The Funny. When she’s not funny but thinks she is. The brains. The rude jokes. The insults. The compliments. The weirdness. Her obsession with documentaries. The obnoxiousness. The independence. With make up. Without makeup. The good and the bad. 

Appreciate everything about her. She needs someone who she can be herself around. Let it all out. So when she wants to crank the radio up and sing to a song she knows all the words to or only the chorus, don’t turn it down. Turn it up louder and sing with her if you know the words and if you don’t make em up she does half the time anyways. Like i said..dance with her in random public places to that song, be obnoxious with her, have fun with her make her feel that weird is normal. Show people that she is yours, you are that lucky son of a bitch that gets to be weird with her. People will look at you and be jealous of what YOU have, not what she has, but you. She is incredible. Amazing and deep down inside has a heart of gold. She will make you wanna drop everything just to be with her. Drive hours just to spend the night with her because with her its right and she makes you feel complete. You will never live life the same after you meet her, without her it will always be incomplete. She will make you fall in love with her and if she doesn’t then you don’t deserve her. 

That girl…..she was my soulmate. She was the one. But now she’s gone. And she’s gone before we had a chance. Our situation wasn’t ideal, we lived 2 hours away from each other and she’s the type of personality that needs someone every night so that worked against me and although i tried it just wasn’t enough. Thats why this one hit hard and hurt the worst. It’s the fact that a connection that her and I had didn’t mature and grow because of distance. It kills me every day knowing that we could have had a happy life together and we didn’t get the chance to see it. We can cling to that ol saying that ‘if its meant to be then we will end up together’ but the only problem with that is it could be too late. And that right now is my biggest fear. Its not losing her because that is done. Its her realizing what we had and it being too late to make it work. To the lucky ones after me, appreciate her and love her for who she is. She’s worth all the awkward moments in public. Theres no other way to put it other than that she’s pretty fucking great. Like i said when she’s gone you will regret it so don’t let her go. Do everything you can to keep her. I promise you won’t be disappointed.

I don't care if we only had known each other for a few months, what we felt was real. I thought it'd lead to something.. something more than that awkward in between stage of not being together, but not being just friends or just a hookup either. You can be with a person for 3 years and feel nothing….you can be with a person for 3 months and feel everything. Every time my phone goes off I just pray it's you and my heart sinks every time it's not. I realize that to this day I would still do anything for you. I would have dropped anything and everything on the spot for you, and if I had a .0001 percent chance of being able to have you I would have left my life for that. I'm an idiot for saying all this and I most likely scared you off. I'm not crazy but I may be a little crazy for you. Its’s only been a few weeks and it feels so much longer than that and it feels weird to know that you’re somewhere out there and despite all the different ways we used to communicate it like there’s an invisible force between us preventing us to do that. It sucks. It’s just weird because everything seems just like a distant memory and you’re just a stranger again after just weeks of this. I can’t even begin to think what my life is gonna be like without yo in it still to this day. At the end of the day I’m just glad I even had the opportunity to ever have met you. If a soul mate was real, you would probably be the one. I’ll always remember you (unless I get Dementia or Alzheimer’s). 

\*\*\*Two months with little to no communication and we ended up together. She moved from her home state to mine and we are currently living a pretty happy life in our own apartment. Sometime's love takes time and space for you to realize certain things....don't ever give up or change who you are. The right one will come along...you just have to be patient.

"I went on a date a few years ago with this guy who wasn't hot but seemed nice. I was charming and everything on the date and he texted the next day. A few weeks passed and he said he had a best friend for me that would be perfect to date who was cute and just like me. We went out a few times and he told me he didn't feel it..I noticed he took forever to text and answer me back. Annoying.. then me and the original guy saw each other online a dating app and he said i was so pretty in my pictures and he wanted to go out again.. Not sure why he didn't ask me out again after the first time but he said he didnt get that vibe from me I was. He called me and texted and we set a date up. The day before the date he said he had to work late and said let's reschedule but never chose another day. He didn't text or ask for a plan for 2 months and I finally texted yesterday after 2 months of silence and said hi. He said he assumed I wasn't interested because we didn't postpone and reschedule the date BUT he's the one who cancelled and never texted again. We now have another date this week. I like when men lead so I am so confused why he would assume I wasn't the interested one when he cancels, doesn't text and disappears? Is he just self conscious because his looks are mediocre?",romance

"Context: England

This starts in the beginning of year 12, but little did I know I knew this from before year 12 like around year 8 year 9. This boy I saw when me and my friends where in a shopping centre stood out to me. I don't know if it was because he was asian (fyi I have a thing for asian boys, like kpop asian). But I genuinely felt my heart shrivel, I knew he had a bad hair cut and ge looked beautiful at the same time. I guess he had a trending haircut, but let's move on. I saw this boy and his name is (for the sake of the story) Bamon. 

Ok. Here is how it goes. I like this Bamon, because he looks good and mostly because he was different to all the other boys, he genuinely expressed himself if he had to. In the beginning of the school year he was in my English class and I would constantly wear make up (I've never done that) and do my hair nice, sit in the front of the class room and any chance I get I indulge in looking at his face once in a while, so I had a MEGA crush on this boy. Honestly I was meant to keep it a secret and not tell anyone til the end of year 13 because I wasn't one of those people who wanted to splay the fact I liked a boy, especially because I am (believe it or not) ugly. To be honest people found out that I liked him and the loudest person in my year group (a friend but she's still loud) went around the common room shouting that I liked Bamon (I think his gf must have heard it). 

So year 12 finished and I never once talked to him and even if I had wanted to I wouldn't because I was so nervous words wouldn't come out I would blush, sweat and make bad jokes. Beforw you think there's a chance, he was going out with a girl called (for the sake of the story) Penny. Year 13 came and I summoned the corouge during summer before the start of Year 13 to talk to this boy, well just sort of pop up to him on social media. And gradually we started talking. At this time I knew his relationship with his girlfirend was rocky because my friends would tell me, and I thought this was my chance to talk to him up and personal (after a while he broke up and got back together with this girl). We got so close we talked to each other about depression and etc. He would tell me how much he loves Penny and how he would get jealous if anyone touches her and this would obviously hurt me a little because all this while, all they ever do is fight or have conflicts. We became sort of friends through this, and he did say some dodgy stuff along the way during this friendship. 

I knew he didn't like me because he wouldn't be the first to approach and obviously knowing that I would distance myself accordingly, also he deleted his profile on the social media we talked on and it was huge conversation. I didn't even have the chance to reply to him. I felt that was a huge sign. 

But every now and then I always wish I could have a glow up and somehow he would like me more than his girlfirend Penny, even though I know that they are happily going out, I want him to somehow turn his attention to me. I would probably do everythig he asks me to do. All I ever do is snoop around his private life, only because I want to help him out and by doing that he would realise that he might like me (but this is impossible because he's a loyal boyfriend). Today I donated £10 to his go fund me charity, because it's something close to his heart. I don't even know. I wrote a message on the go fund me that might make him recognise who wrote it. But I know he doesn't care that much, because he probably won't even recognise my personality. He's always surrounded by beautiful girls and so many friends, despite him saying that he doesn't have any friends. I don't know if he would or not. I just want him to notice me. Even as a close friend would be fine. But he probably won't try to acknowledge me as anyone special because he has a girlfriend. 

I know I should stop but somehow I can't. I liked him even before I knew he had a girlfriend.",romance
"What is romance/love?
Trying to figure out how to describe it, but really it's up to all of us? Romance is not written in stone, it's simply just what makes you click with a person? The activities we do together to bond, getting closer? Personally I think I would call something intimite between partners romantic. It could be anything. What do we really refer to when we call ourselves for romantic/aromantic?

Any thoughts?",romance
"I was friends with this girl and then I met her best friend and we became closer then the original friend. We talked on the phone all the time and hanged out at school. She liked this one guy before she met me a senior she texted him she liked him a day later he didn't text back she texted ""what the fuck if you don't like me then just be for real etc"" he said he liked her too and that he wants to get a car and a job first so just wait. We became good friends I wasn't interested at first but she changed my mind i don't know I started liking her personality. We were talking in the hallway and I suggested we should kiss and she out of no where does and once again on another occasion 2 weeks later. After each kiss she would hold onto my arms. At the end of the school year the guy she likes invited her to the senior party at the end of the year. He's hosting. the day after my birthday she calls me and says that it's been between me and him and that she loves me but she she wants to remain friends and she said I was taking it well and I was but at the end of the call she could hear the hurt in my voice. She said she would understand if I didn't want to be friends I sayed I will but I won't talk to her for a week or two. I call her 4 days later at 1 o clock in the morning and we started talking like usual like friends but I asked her could we talk about something serious about a few nights ago. She taled about how i mean so much to her and our friendship, she said one of my problems was I was childish and don't try at stuff. I told her I was taking all honors classes next year and she sayed how proud she was I told her I was changing and not cause of her but because soon I'm going to be an adult and I need to be responsible . She said that's good I told her we'll be cool for now but with  my personality and charm I can easily get her back she said your not usually this cocky she said she might change her mind but not to be wasting all my time on her and I said I won't I have some other things going on I've been to a couple of video game tournament hung out with friend programmed a website but I started thinking about her again cause the party is in a couple of days and I haven't really talked to her since then like 2 times there's going to be like 200 people and drugs and alcohol. And this guy is known for doing drugs. She said she won't do drugs cause she doesn't want to do something she'll regret. Depending on how this party goes if they're a thing then I'll back off just barely talk to her. If not I'll try to make a move hang out over the summer. I'm unsure what I should do. in her defense I use to talk about other girls all the time and the day before she gave me that call I told her how I touched a girls ass but my friend said that had no effect on It. Before I was unsure but now that I don't see and talk to her I understand what she means to me. What should I do?",romance

"What I wouldn't give to love someone without holding back. 

I love people. All the time, every day, every message, every call, every talk online in voice rooms and group chats. I love all my family. My friends. My closest of companions. 

But none of them are for me to love... without holding back. 

There are few who have touched my inner self. Caught a glimpse of the rarest creature they could have ever encountered - the truest me I could ever know. 

She grew up in a house. A dirty one. A smelly one. A loud one. A broken one. Roaches crawled into her bed every so often. Food laid around, wasting, for days sometimes. Items spewn about the ground, some intact, some broken, some dirty, some clean, some so beyond their original state is was a wonder if you could tell its prior purpose. Some were Mom's. Some were Dad's. Some were hers. But none of it was really hers, she thought. No toy was really hers, no game, no device, not her bed, not her clothes, not her fish in the tank next to her bed, not even her bed. Not the room where she was relecated. Not the home she grew up in. All of it could be taken in an instant. Because she said something wrong. Did the thing the wrong way. Missed a question on the test and didn't get it right all the way. Forgot Mom was sleeping. Bothered Dad too much after work. 

The house was always smelling bad in some way. Rotton things, putrid things, smell of cat and dog and human and plant. musky, humid, horrid. 

The house was always loud. Very loud. Machines not working right. Cars with loud engines. Loud grass cutters. Loud Mom. Loud Dad. Very Loud Mom. Screaming Mom. Yelling Dad. What did they yell about? Why couldn't they be quiet? Did they not like each other? Did they not like her? They talked about her, yelled about her, a lot. Food? Money? House? Bills? Her. Her. Always her. 

Was it her fault? She reasoned, maybe. If she wasn't there, there wouldn't be as many bills. There wouldn't be as many arguments about money for food or for that thing called ""rent"". Maybe they could be happier without each other, someone else maybe? No, they had to stay together ""for her"". For each other? For her. Always for her. Why though? They were always mad at each other. Mom would Scream at Dad a lot. Scream so loudly and so hard that she'd lose her voice, break and turn purple in the face and spit would fly and her eyes would go wide. 

After all that, The Real Me wished for something she wasn't getting from her parents. But what?

After going through Elementary and Middle School, passing grades with ease and making some friends here and there that came and went, little did she expect anyone to show her some attention past what her school mates and teachers showed her. 

Then came The First. 

He was tall, a head higher than she was. A full head of hair that fell softly to his shoulders, a wide jawline and a smile that stretched across the globe, with teeth as pearly white as they could be naturally. A chest and arms that could pick up anything he wanted. Legs that carried him for days and leagues with every confident step in his military-influenced stride. His charm was as clear as his cream colored skin. 
Something awoke in The Real Me, little thing that she was. Something warm, then hot, burning bright and quick and raging. A crush? First Love? Dumb Young Romance? Something close to the first kind of affection she felt she could get without having to beg for it. It felt... nice. 

The relationship bloomed and gave her some comfort as the shit at home got even shittier (somehow). Two years and four months later, everything came. Crashing. Down. 

Spiraling out of control, The Real Me kind of.... gave up. Died a bit. She fell into a bout of Depression that lasted maybe five months or so. Barely eating or drinking fluids, not even showering for two weeks solid at most. Being tossed aside so easily after finding someone that cared, that felt like her best friend, was more than she could bear. 

In the last bit of those five months, came The Second.

You could tell I wasn't really looking at physicality this time by the way he looked. He was heavy set, only half a head taller than me, with a big belly and a soft round face. Cuban descent, pale as could be, Nerdy as they came, with a big poof of curly black on his head. His teeth weren't straight, his hands shook with uncertainty, and his glasses always sat a milimeter crooked on one side or the other. He came from a Mexican/Cuban Family that was sort of like mine. 

That should have thrown up some red flags REAL QUICK. But, as it turns out, ANY excuse to get out of the pit that was my depression was a good one. Even this guy. 

He became my best friend. He showed me his friends. We all hung out and shared jokes and were part of the beginning of the meme culture that has now blossomed in today's world. I graduated in Maroon and Silver, with my boyfriend cheering me on and whooping and hollering the loudest as I walked across that stage, my two colored tassle with the number 14 hanging in front of my left eye swinging back and forth. I entered the world of College. And he cheered me on, even through the resentment that he had failed college himself, wishing he could go back. 
Through financial strain, family problems, and my growing desire for physical intimacy, it was hard for us to find peace in anything but each other. Take his Mom's car, ride around town for hours, up and down Montrose, Westheimer, Richmond, from River Oaks to Bellaire, back to the Galleria, Spring Branch, Northside, even Midtown. Eat at every place we saw that fit our budget. Play games together on the Playstation or the computer. And Sex. Lots of it. 

But, having been watching our respective families show their real colors, and getting even harder on us individually, it took its toll. I was beginning to resent the control my parents wanted to still impose on me, and the choking nature his parents wanted to watch us, like buzzards circling roadkill. It was maddening. 

But then I started to notice something that had been going on for most of my relationship with this guy. 
I started to see him cracking. And remembered that he'd been acting this way for a long time. Clinging to me, making remarks when I said someone looked good. Wanting Sex a LOT. Even when I wasn't wanting it. And pressuring me and convincing me to do it anyway. There was a lot of insecurity. And I couldn't fix it. I tried, silly me, but I shouldn't have. And I began to distance myself from the rose colored glasses and saw the relationship for what it was. And after two and a half years of being with him, I had had ENOUGH. I ended the relationship, knowing that I was essentially the confidence boost to his very underdeveloped ego. 

After all that, I went forward in college trying to stay motivated. But the depression came back. It hit me hard, smacked me down, dragged me across the pavement, and kicked me out of college to start living my life as a wanna-be citizen of this country working hard for little pay. I fought with my mind, my heart, my physical desires for about a year, making friends and then promptly throwing them into my issue-ridden closet for them to see me for what I was back then. 

Something Else. 

The Real Me was chained up in the darkest corner of my mind, of her own free will. She was scared of the light, shaking, pissing herself, with the Dark Thing lording over the body and terrorizing her newfound friends. Including the ones that I was interested in romantically. Kinda. I was growing to want to be in a romantic relationship again. But this time I was so focused on having friends and getting to know people BEFORE I dated anyone that it seemed every friend I made just wanted to stay friends. And even though I still have most of these friends, the close ones (at this point there's only really  4) they are the only ones I'm close to. Therefore the only ones I trust the most. And it leaves me in a predicament. 

I am fearful to open myself up again. To try and let The Real Me out once again. The little one that felt love and wanted more, and has always loved everyone in the purest way. The one that looks at her friends with the dearest care and respect. The one that is starting to thirst for the real world again. 

She loves strongly. She sees her friends, close and otherwise, and tries to give them what support they need and want, as little or as much as they ask, but I always keep her in check to make sure it's not wearing her down like before. And she always wants to be close, intimate in sweet ways, like hugging, holding, cuddling, giving little kisses on the cheek, saying ""I love you"" without fear of rejection. She always looks for the romantic side of life. The cheesey jokes, the cheeky inuenndos, the lazy days on voice chat with a friend all day while they're at work or at home doing their thing but wanting company. She's pure and sweet and never gets jealous, never gets too angry, never thinks in absolutes. She's grown a bit. 

But she's still so fresh.

I have seen a lot in so little time, it seems. Being 22, you'd say ""Oh, give it time, you'll find someone!"" You're right, I can give it time, and the opportunity will come along, and I can enter a romantic relationship again. But who will it be? Will we make the right choice this time? Let the right one in? 

Maybe. 

But the little one, the pure one, wants to say something to her close friends, the ones she loves the strongest. The ones she wishes she could give the world to. 

Hey there you guys and girls. I'm so happy to see you. Your hair, short, thick, long, curly, sitting on your head, brown, blonde, firey orange, hidden under hats and bound in ties. Your eyes, hazel, brown, blue, green, golden even. Your stature, always somehow taller than me! I will never tire looking up at you. I'd share a hug with you, either with arms that comfortably wrap around me at the same sort of height, or that completely engulf me in the embrace of a giant. When we go swimming in the heat, your bare chest shining in the sunlight, barely a whisker on you, or the times we lay there shirtless, I in my bra, you showcasing your wonderful fluff! Or, maybe even lazly lounging on the couch, your soft peach fuzz covered self, a bit bigger than me, giving me a comforting cloud of friend to lay against. All of it is so wonderful! I love making you laugh, guffaws that vibrate my bones, high pitched giggles that send me into fits, light hearted and pure sounds of joy as they rapid fire from your shaking frame. I can even get you wheezing sometimes, unable to contain yourself, falling silent as you fail to take in enough air for a proper laugh! Tears fall from my eyes, my stomach aches, I can't breathe either, as we share in some joke or stupid comment or wonderful moment!

There are moment's when I'm down, or you are, and we give each other hugs, I may kiss your cheek, I will squeeze you tight, or while I'm on chat with you I'll send you every sweet sticker I can find on my device, hugs and glomps and full on jump tackles! We talk about the issue, we sort it out, I get myself right or you do. We may disagree, but we come back. We settle down. We sort it out. And we will walk away happier, good, or just better than before. I will never tire of talking, texting, messaging, voice chatting, especially when you need me, or I may need you. I hope my friendship with you means something good, something important. Because yours matters a lot to me! And I will always love you. No matter where life takes you or me! 
Maybe you're the best friend I haven't made yet. Maybe you're the one I grow to love later on than this! I hope we're best friends regardless if I am in a romantic relationship with you or not. I just wanna have fun and be merry. I wanna sort out problems and work together and I won't get upset and quit at the slightes sign of struggle. I won't give up so easily again. I will let you do your things and you'll let me do mine, and then we'll do stuff together! 

What I want, in this whole world, now that I've been born, died, and came back, and learned, is this: 
I want to love, be loved, and have fun. Friend, Lover, Family, even you Stranger. Take some love from me. Pass it on. Show the world the care and affection it deserves. Don't give out too much all at once, you'll burn away like I did. Worry not for how people will judge you. People say I loved too much, do hard, too many times. Too many chances, too many times I've forgiven and let go. 

But I'll never stop loving. I'll never stop giving to those I care for. Because I have so much of it now, all within me, wishing to burst forth, that if I don't, I might surely explode! And I don't expect all that much in return. The simple things in life fuel me now. And I will always be here. 

I will always stay strong.

"We started dating a year ago. It was fun to hangout so we have a day we will get together and watch some shows. It started to be a routine and I noticed that it was always me ask him to hangout, and if we don't have any show in mind, he will play a bunch of meme video and no interaction with me unless I start to talk. I know he is super nerd and he is proud of being a nerd and memer. It is great when he is funny, but I am so tired initiate everything. Some might prefer this kind of interaction but I am a passive person, too! Lately when we hangout, I feel we are just staying in the same space, because if I don't interact with him, he won't do it either. I keep initiating talking, hangout, romance activity, and I am exhausted.

He says he is better hanging out as playing online games so I joined the game he is playing a while ago. But he plays games with one of his friend in daily basis. I had a discussion with him about how I feel when he is 100&amp;#37; passive,  and it feels like we started dating just because I started it; I don't feel he is into me at all. \(he gave me hints first, but we didn't started dating until I point it out and ask if he means it\) He always tells me he do have me in his heart, but he still acts the same. Sometimes I even feel I was the 3rd person between he and his friend...

I am tired. I tried communicate with him but it does not work... I have a friend has a boyfriend like that and it took them 7 years to improve to the level he will try talk to her. I don't know how long I will need to keep communicating and I am almost out of energy already... 

I tried to mention my bday coming soon lately and wondering if he will do anything. I don't know if I am prepared if he still doesn't do anything...

"I’ve had a few relationships, unfortunately I’ve never been with someone who has returned my feelings to the same extent. Those romances were ultimately always disappointing. 

Loving someone from afar though is interesting, even if never reciprocated or discovered by the object of your affection. Take my current situation, I’ve never been pro-work romances but I’ve started a new job and there’s a man that just takes my breath away. He’s kind, honest, loyal, ambitious and driven - many of the things I so want to see in my future husband. 

One problem is that he’s already someone else’s husband. I don’t agree with infidelity in any sense and I would never want to hurt someone that way, but often I think about what it would be like to wake up next to him, my husband. To stroll along the beach with our children (he already has 1 with his wife), work together and confide in him. He’s utterly brilliant and I am almost completely sure that he’s not told it nearly often enough.

He inspires me, believes in me and champions me. No one has ever done any of those things. It hurts my heart to be away from him but he makes it sing when we’re together.

So yes, even loving someone from afar is precious. The very best and the very worst thing, all at once. ",romance

"Hey guys. So my girlfriend who I'm pretty crazy about is moving out of state May 18th. I'm really fucked up over it. She also happens to be my first serious girlfriend in life. I'm 23, she's 24. 

Anyway, I'm a die-hard romantic, and I'm always writing her poems and saying lots of beautiful things to her. She is... Not a romantic (describes herself as 'aromantic', in fact) but I do know she appreciates my sentiments and romantic gestures. I recently took it to a bit of an extreme and burned her initials into my arm in big letters with a cigarette.

That said, I have a thing for words and writing, and I was thinking of giving her a letter penned in my own blood for when she leaves. Obviously another rather extreme measure, but I'd be doing it because I meant every single word. If you got such a letter from a significant other, how would you feel? Any thoughts, other than that I'm batshit insane? ",romance
"So broke up with my then gf a few months back. All my friends think she was bad for me and that I shouldn’t go back, but I think we still have feelings for each other. We agreed to try and be friends and the breakup was pretty mutual. 

Thing is I feel like I messed up and made her uncomfortable, at least that was the vibe I got at the time, but I don’t know what it was, maybe I was too clingy, maybe I just wasn’t good enough, might have also been my bouts of chronic depression that recurred towards the end of things.

She made me feel something that I’ve never felt before and I kinda miss her, on the other hand I found that when she went to parties etc she often wanted/maybe attempted to get with other guys.

The other issue is that I think
I might be interested in one of her good friends......

Any advice?

"So this might sound weird, even stalker-ish but honestly it's just the product of circumstance, so bear with me. I live in a tiny studio apartment. I have a neighbor who is a single female who lives in a studio unit right next to me. I work very odd hours though so I've only ever seen her twice. Every so often (like maybe every other month or so) I hear her having wild passionate sex on the other side of my wall. I have never seen her with a guy and she lives in a very tiny apartment so it's pretty safe bet that she's single, and the infrequency of these events and the fact that they only ever occur on weekend nights lead me to believe that she is probably hooking up with random dudes. I am single. She looks my age. How can I indicate to her that I am available and dtf without being really creepy? I mean it seems like it would be really convenient right? Like we live right next to each other we could just walk over and knock on each other's doors anytime we feel lonely or horny. I thought about leaving a note on her door with my phone number but that just seems creepy to me. Thoughts?",romance

"how to romance, how to understand and recognize romance or convey romance or make my relationship more romantic. These things elude me. Definitions describe things i make a point to do yet i am told by my SO that i dont romance her or woo her. she says she needs me to be more romantic, yet when i look things up and try those things we tend to get into more fights and have more problems. when i ask her to explain what she means when she wants me to be romantic she simply states that anything she told me would be worthless since if i did any of it, it would be her idea and not mine. i have asked some friends that seem to concur that this is true. the romantic things i have read about that do not result in fight either go unnoticed and/or normalized or, as she has now expanded her thought on my actions to me, interpreted ans sexual advances of some kind or another. She now tells me that although we are in a good emotional and sexual relationship that has love, it is not a romantic or loving relationship. Nothing makes sencec, everything i read seems to be someones particular form of romantic action steps based on understanding of romance, but with out an understandable, relatable, thought proccess of what romance actual is that they are baseing there actions on. i am so frustrated, angry,sad and heart broken over this. why can nothing or no one actually have a detailed relatable over all definition of what romance is that an understanding of which would allow one to produce words an actions that would envoke feelings of romance or at least impart romantic intent or interest to others!!!!? Please help. My journey on this is years old now. i have no real help. There are some things most people just inatley know that allow them to understand articles and how to guides and figure out bullshit from the real. i do not have this understanding. i say this because for years i have read and acted upon advice only for it to have a neutral to negative effect in my life and relationship. in all of my in-person conversations with SO and friends, i always have to end it with""well, i guess im not a romantic person."" this is more throwing my hads up in the air and lashing out in order to end the conversation and give rather than except it as true. What am i missing people. am i incapable of this thing that everyone else can understand on sight? Am I the romantic equivalent of face blind or autistic? What happens when my SO meets someone who IS romantic? if she has a romantic but non-sexual relationship with them and for me is it kind of over, despite the relationship being "" emotional and sexual but not loving or romantic""? please help help help.",romance

"Alright so my brother has been friends with this boy, let’s name him Diego, for about 4 years or so. They’re only one year older than me. Whenever they hung out at my house I would try to just mind my own business and not go near them at all, mainly because Diego made me nervous since he is really good looking . A while back, he added me on snapchat and we started a streak, of course i only snapchatted him when i didn’t look like a freaking man without makeup. We often talked a lot over text after a couple of weeks and when he came to my house to hang out with my brother, I found myself trying to get near them like when they were in the living room i would go to the kitchen ( nearest place to living room). Diego and I would exchange some stares and smiles but that was it. Soon enough Diego and I would start flirting over text but when my brother found out about that he didn’t allow Diego to come over anymore which had me triggered, but it didn’t stop Diego and I from texting lmfao. A couple of months passed and my brother eventually forgot about me and Diego then started inviting him over again. Recently, last week when Diego slept over, my brother fell asleep early so Diego and I met up in the living room and made out, which was a mess cause it was hella dark so i was just hoping i wouldn’t accidentally bite his face or some shit like that idk it was my first kiss so my bitchass didn’t know wtf i was doing. Anyways, I don’t know if I should stop talking to him out of respect for my brother cause he’s against it or keep talking to Diego cause it’s what I want. My brother isn’t usually the protective type with me and doesn’t really care when i think his friends are hot but for some reason it’s different with Diego.

"Inside the thoughts of Lucinda.


Things are going wonderful with him, perhaps to good. At this point I would be in fear, like fear of losing this but.... Oddly I have none. It may be hard to believe but he has filled me with so much love that there is no room for fear. I've discovered that both emotions can't coexist in our hearts. Try feeling love and fear at once.... You can't! You either feel one or the other (try it). Like all women my emotions aren't stable and can vary in intensity and range. Yet when I come to him with my many moods he crowns them all with hugs and kisses. He knows that feminine nature is just like actual nature. Get it? It's not always sunny, sometimes there's storms and even disasters... He is my masculine stability and I can come to him however and find that stable Love that allows me to relax in his arms. He is different indeed, time passes and there's never any boredom with us. He keeps an element of mystery at all times that keeps me guessing. He shows up sometimes unexpectedly and tells me and shows me different things. I love it.  Also, the courtship phase never ended. How does he know that women want to live in a "" romantic novel"" forever? Idk but it keeps things alive when he constantly creates adventures and plots for me where I can remain young and beautiful forever for him. I think he lives for this... If he is feeling down all I have to do is wear something sexy and be affectionate and instantly his eyes light up. Sometimes a smile and a wink can inspire him to move the world for me or create me those love stories I love so much. I'm ranting now but I just feel the world needs romantics to inspire us all sometimes... Adieu

"So one of my friends introduced me to one of his other friends. 
Now, some background here. 
I'm a guy 22, been single all along. 
This girl 20, don't know about her relationships.
We're both into music and we both spent the entire afternoon singing and listening to some crazy good tracks.
I learnt some stuff about her mental health which I could relate to since I've been in and out of depression time and time again.
We left from my friend's place together.
Conversations on the cab ride home we're deep, like we spoke vaout how we cope with the issues we have. 
And I felt a sense that she was inching towards me in the cab, though I'm not sure. 
Since I only new her for about 5 hours the handshake before we left was a long lingering one but where I think only I felt something. 

This is new but I haven't felt like this before.

"So two weeks ago I decided to break up with my girlfriend because things between us had withered a bit. I still have feelings for her but I think it’s best if we both move on, tbh I think she wasn’t that interested on a physical level anyway and she is looking for a different sort of relationship.
So after that it has been difficult and now a mate suggested an acquaintance who I should maybe get to know. This acquaintance sounds really cool and I’m going to meet her at this party in a few weeks but I’m really nervous. How do I act like a normal human? What do I say?
Once conversation starts I think I’ll be fine but how do I start talking?

She was ovulating and all my 5 senses knew it. My eyes were hungry today and she came to work dressed in a dress that provided a banquet. She had Pink lipstick on her thick lips and everytime she smiled it took stabs at my heart. ""Breathe Alex"" I said ""Breathe"". But my eyes betrayed me! Some women were placed on this earth to rattle men to their core and she was one of them. If these were prehistoric times I would've ravished her on sight. Of course, she knows all of this. Women of her beauty know that they cause ruckus where ever they go. Weak, insecure women hate on and envy them. Men on the other hand will risk it all 😂😂 but they dare not fuck her outside the confines of their minds, silly daydreams.

"KHAROLYNNE 


As I frequently do, I entered the Midnight Lounge, ordered my usual drink a chambord cocktail and began to look around. Before I took my first sip I noticed an unusual dark silhouette in the corner. It stood confidently and by its graceful and feminine movements, I could tell a beautiful woman hid behind that shadowy mystery. She is the one today I thought and so I gathered my drink and thoughts, and walked towards her. Ernesto the bartender smiled and winked at me, he knew me so well by now. When I stood directly infront of her she was already greeting me with a smirk and careful eyes. ""You look stunning, mysterious and......you're not drinking anything? whats you're name pretty""?  She said nothing and just looked at me the way someone looks at a piece of unusual art. We exchanged gazes which meant we exchanged thoughts. When you carefully look into a woman's eyes she will reveal things to you. In this exchange her eyes told me she was happily taken. The smile that slowly accompanied, told me she appreciated the compliments because now she felt prettier. After our silent quick conversation I turned to walk away. ""KHAROLYNNE, my name is KHAROLYNNE "" she said. I smiled at her and walked back to Ernesto for an encore beverage.

"     I was at my best friend's New Year's party, and his 20 year old sister was home. The two of us done hit it off, as we are extremely similar. I ended up staying in Grant's (My friend) craft room, and playing a game with her for the whole night, rather than hang out with everyone my age. At around 10:00 I finally realized they kept looking at us and giggling. When 11:45 rolled around, people started questioning new years kisses. Grant went with his girlfriend, and that left Heyley (his sister), Sadie (childhood friend) and myself. Grant got a devilish grin on his face as he asked ""Nathan, who are YOU gonna kiss, Heyley?"". I said, no, she's twenty dumbass!"" Sadie and I are 16, and Grant was 15 at the time, while Adara(GF) was 19. He said ""It's not THAT big of an age gap, same as Adara and I"" I ended up just refusing, and we just continued to hang out.
     Then, about 2 months later, we went skating, and once again, Heyley was home from college. The entire way to the skating rink, we talked. Obviously there was some giggling in the back I wasn't understanding at the time. My older brother Mike(18) was there too this time though. I ended up playing a new game with her this time, yes, I did it again, but, in my defense, it was a good game. Yet again, they shipped us and giggled all night.
     Then last night, it was Grant's birthday party, same people, just no Mike or Sadie, and Heyley was once again home. This time, rather than playing a game till 12:00, we just talked about random things, from sexual preference, to anime characters, right around to transgender theory. At the end of the night, after Heyley had left, they started teasing me about it again. It was very weird... I think... Actually, thinking about it on the way to my father's home gave me the closest thing to a panic attack I have ever had. It scared me, I just got so lost in the thoughts of ""Grant could end up as my brother"" and ""20 and 16 is very far apart"". I have never been scared or stressed about relationships, but this feels different.

"Emotional Alchemy 

I remember when I walked into that office for an errand and she was behind the desk helping me. She sat there giving me legal advice with her little portfolio. Time stopped as my awareness leaped into the nothingness of the present moment. Have you ever been so immersed in the now that your focus becomes godlike. I mean you notice everything... Like the fact that her small intelligent dark eyes would look up at mine less and less as time went on because my heavy gaze had conquered unexplored territory in her mind. I could tell what she was thinking and she knew it. Women love a man that can hold eye contact because it shows confidence, but that is child's play. I posses eye contact that startles women because of its rarity nowadays.  My gaze cuts wide and deep and if she leaves herself unguarded I will drag her to the treacherous shores of love. Anyway, as she continued with her presentation my eyes explored every inch of her. Her light freckles her bottom lip, her thick thighs everything. My emotions rivaled the four elements of nature in violence and intensity. However, I've been in this position many times so I transmuted the chaos into a friendly smile and a playful wink when I parted and walked away. Welcome to the art of Emotional  Alchemy.

"So I stopped replying her messages on WhatsApp because she was too over demanding.

I once met this Girl in the room of my guy when she came to charge her (only God knows what), then I fell partially in love with her. I collected her phone contact and I started courting her on WhatsApp which she consented.

In the space of a weeks, she demanded for airtime which I innocently sent her an amount of N1500(Naira, Nigeria currency). I believed we where flowing not until she asked again another airtime in the space of 5days, not that I hadn't the cash to send but I was just trying to use my common sense by telling her I will send but not immediately.
It was during this time I had a rethought about this and stop replying her messages on WhatsApp. We didn't communicate for about 2 months not until yesterday, she called me and said that she was angry with me for not contacting her for a long time. She said I should come to her hostel to see her.

I decided going to the hostel because I had in mind that after I see her, I will go to my Friend's lodge around that area.

Before i reached her hostel, i branched to a bank around my area but the crowd was enormous, I had to see her like that because I can't wait.
When I reached her hostel, i entered, she was on bum-short. She was like, where is my Valentine gift, I told her when I would be going home, we will branch to the bank, that I had no cash right there with me.

Her mood suddenly became gloomy but she didn't wanted making it obvious.

She asked if I would eat, I said no, she started using indirect means to make sure i lavish on her. Our conversion was like
She: My phone is really bad
Me: oh, really?
She: Yea.. It's a techno phone
Me: oh, nice phone.
She: but I can't use it because it's bad, I need a new phone
Me: No response*
She: you can get it for me as a Val gift.
Me: lol.. Yeah sure.
She: please let go to the bank now, Diamond bank(a bank in Nigeria) is very close
Me: The line is to much, I can't stand under the sun
She: You will wait here, I will go for you
Me: C'mon I can't give you my Atm
She: OK, you have Mobile App(a money transfer app) right? Please transfer some money for me so I will buy the phone
Me: I don't have a Mobile App
She: OK.. What about your sim? I can transfer with your sim, hope you registered your bank account with this sim?
Me: no, I didn't

I waiting for like 5min, and all she was talking was Money Money Money. I felt so uncomfortable And I told her to be ready that, on Saturday, I will send her the money and even take her out. I Collected her account details and boom, off I go.
I think, today would be the very last day I would chat or even communicate her again.

"""Violette""


The kettle is whistling at me, letting me know that my much anticipated tea is ready. A small gesture from her part that brings a smile to my face. As I sip my tea,  another beautiful creature of the same essence  comes to mind......Violette. You see,  just like Violette the kettle is decorated with beautiful features. Rainbows, flowers and a sunset are illustrated on its cylindrical body. The arch that makes the handle is a clear substance with delicate little streaks of pink. Just a decoration? Not to me, what I see is inspiration, that particular inspiration that comes from the beauty of feminine energy. I like to think that the artist just like me had a keen eye for beauty. That the artist came  across his own Violette, and  that she stopped him dead in his tracks and stole his breath. At the same time she gave him the inspiration to create this kettle that at the moment is serving me my tea. The thought makes me smile. Today I will see her, oh Violette.... and I think she knows that I've already started an affair with her in my mind. Yes, she is married. Happily? Oh I don't know. Emotions are fickle they change day to day. What I do know is the look of unfulfillment in the eyes of Violette, curious eyes. I look in her eyes and see a thunderous storm at night time. You know, the kind with heavy rain, and a dark purple sky. Beautiful..... Violent winds and bright streaks of thunder illuminating the darkness. A storm that warns everyone to run for shelter..... but not because its dangerous but because that is all the storm knows and she is used to it. Oh Violette I am different. I will run outside and bathe in your violence and gaze at you're streaks of lightning with a smile on my face. I will stand there drenched for hours until your storm dies down. Then I will kiss the top of your head, and then hold your fragile little hands and unleash the wrath of the beautiful masculine. The thought makes me smile.

"Right to start things off, I'm a boy that's just recently turned 15 and for the longest time now I've been feeling really lonely. I often think to myself how nice it would be to hold hands with a girl and walk through a forest or a park. I also think about how nice it would feel to hug a girl tightly. 

I want a girlfriend but at the same time I don't as most girls my age are unpleasant to be around. I also go to an all boys school, so that's a problem. I think of going to an all boys school as a good thing and a bad thing because I can't talk to girls at all. But I think it's also a good thing because I'm scared all the girls and boys that are complete assholes will make fun of me. I really don't what to do. I'm conflicted. 

There is a girl called Becky I see every now and then because her school is close to mine. (She goes to an all girls school btw) and she's really cute and nice and I'd really want to get to know her more but everytime I see her, the only thing I can do is say ""Hi"" like the awkward idiot I am. I think about her sometimes and I even fantasised about us being married once. 

I'm not trying toot my own horn but I think I'd make a good boyfriend. I'm willing to her 100% of the time, even when she's being an idiot. I'm willing to give her space if she needs it. I'm willing to treat her like a princess and do a fuck ton of other things. I'm not just talking about becky btw. But this will likely never be the case. I'll probably never find anyone. I have low self esteem, I'm chubby, annoying, unapproachable, stupid and plenty of other things. 

I really need help. As you can clearly see by this post, I'm not good at communicating with anyone. Any solutions on how to fix my loneliness? Any help would be appreciated.

UPDATE: 17th March - thank you to anyone who has responded to me so far. I've read every response but haven't replied to them all as I'm kind of awkward and don't want to repeat myself because then it looks like I'm not really being grateful. Anyway, I'm yet to see her again but I should focus on myself for now, as suggested by a couple of people. I'll keep you guys updated and once again, thank you. ",romance

Release – Se puder divulgar:
TIBETE – o novo romance de Silas Corrêa Leite – E quando você não quiser mais ser gente?
-O novo romance do escritor Silas Corrêa Leite, lançado ao final do ano passado pela Editora Jaguatirica, RJ, vem bem a calhar, tendo em vista o tenebroso momento em que se resta o Planeta Terra, e particularmente o Brasil também em crise sem precedentes históricos, em que há uma falência generalizada de valores e estruturas sociais, terrivelmente depondo com o que deveria ser o público fito ético-plural-comunitário da  sociedade nesses tempos de falta de qualidade de vida e de uma convivência humana de baixíssimo nível. Fugir seria a melhor estratégia? Loucos escrevem. Céu ou inferno moram nos desfechos?  O personagem principal do livro, nesse contexto todo relata sobre as tormentas de um ex-escritor marcado, com altos e baixos na vida, mas, afinal evoluído socialmente falando, e que num estranho súbito momento, um bendito dia saca que não é feliz; avalia que o que conquistou não o satisfaz, quando conclui que “vencer na vida” não é tudo, não significa nada, não faz sentido, e, parafraseando Caetano veloso se questiona: tudo o que conquistou, a que será que se destina? Fechamento de ciclo.
De cara resolve pular fora do sistema, da redoma de infernos que é seu meio conturbado. Larga tudo e vai em busca de um lugar para chamar de céu, um infinito particular que seja. Quer um canto para se esconder de ser gente, de ver gente, se tratar de si, se reconciliar, cavar uma trilha, um buraco, antes que faça uma besteira... Estresse e paranoia de finalmente se descobrir sendo uma coisa que não quis ao final de tudo, passando da idade do lobo.
Volta para sua aldeia, Itararé-SP, foge de existir. Lá vai morar no mato, mal sabendo lavar um par de meias, um lenço, ou fritar um ovo. Terá que, numa emergencial e improvisada cultura de subsistência, adaptar-se na marra, longe da urbanidade tantã e da civilização em derrocada, para repensar o caminho que fez, como se numa espécie de jornada espiritual de recolhimento temporão, de reconciliação e mesmo de depuração de sua interioridade ferida, de sua sensibilidade lixada de ver, fermentar, engolir sapos, aceitar regras, chorar, sofrer, conviver, sobreviver... Com o mundo num labiríntico caos, com sua crise de identidade de turrão, concorrente, sedentário, já obeso, calvo e com problemas de saúde, além de síndromes pintando num campo minado de cobranças ridículas, entre boletos de posses e sachês viciados de poses insatisfatórias, mais doenças paraexistenciais e questionamentos de neuras, o personagem enquanto se adapta num barracão dentro de um manto de selva, vai relembrando o que sofreu, as perdas e danos, idas e vindas, traições e incompletudes, cartéis e cassinos, bolando artes loucas dentro do funil da crise de perquirir, ao mesmo tempo em que compactua com o recanto que ergueu pra si, e confronta a natureza primária pertinho o abraçando e sustentando, na sua  busca de paz, o terrível encontro consigo mesmo, pela frustração com tudo, o nada que é tudo, feito um desorientado cidadão pós-moderno num mundo corrompido, procurando se achar enquanto há tempo. 
Na capa do romance de 382 páginas, o aviso: “Destruam este diário, ou destruam suas vidas”. A obra é isso mesmo, uma espécie de diário de resistência e luta, de busca da reformatação do ser, de uma transformação radical, mais, a de busca de um buraco para se encaixar depois de questionamentos, se isolando feito um Tibete íntimo, uma guarita, uma cápsula de nave, um jardim secreto, um esconderijo, uma Pasárgada, uma Shangri-lá, que é na emergência da situação de conflito e confronto, a periferia rural de Itararé, na lonjura distante de um lugar em que o judas perdeu o All-Star. 
O deslocado personagem meio eremita que sonha um Mosteiro Ateu ou um Monastério Lico, as vezes introspectivo, de acordo com a lua, as vezes anarquista libertário, ou romântico sonhador da pá virada, quando não incendiário, perigoso, detona tudo, registra, narra, incendeia irrazões. E o leitor sendo testado, também vai acabar fazendo uma viagem de recolhimento que o livro Tibete faculta e induz, antes que venha o cometa ou o cavalo amarelo do Apocalipse. Vai nessa toada o romance.
Lendo o Tibete você sofre, se encontra, revolta, se confronta, assusta mas se requalifica, a repensar melhor sua vidinha merreca e seus infernos de grifes, impropriedades, consumismo e obrigações piradas de meros vazios existenciais. E pode clarear a mente adubada pela mídia abutre; deixar de ser bovinamente refém do consumismo irado, começando assim a vitimizar conquistas espúrias, pois, como diz Raul Seixas, “Quem entra em buraco de rato/De rato tem que transar”. Nesse mundo insano, vencer numa sociedade assim não significa nada, muito menos mérito notório.  Liberte-se também. Leia Tibete e também Tibete-se. Eis o verbo

So here i was again a place i know almost too good , the beach, being lifeguard was an escape i tend to run to everytime i feel life gets a bit too heavy.As a lifeguard girls come and go, at least is what i thought before i met HER.
It started like every other boring morning on the beach only this day they moved me to new station, few hours of chatting with my partner ,and oh my... i was not prepared for what is about to happen, there she was, she passed next to me just out of arm reach as like she knew this game way too good, for a meer second i caught a glance of her eyes as we made eye contact, somehow our smiles got erased as like if we where in shock of seeing someone you knowed all your life but lost contact with a lifetime ago... I felt some overwhelming attraction i never wanted to touch someone so much in my life before, but thats not how the game is played so i had to act cool.I waited for her to go on her sunbed gave her some minutes to rise her interest, and here i go making my lion walk towards her, having an emotional chaos in my head,some panic attacks some excitement and an ounce of arousal.So here i was standing next to her in all my lifeguard ""glory"" making sentence from combining words from 3-4 languages as i was trying to understand where she was from.She responded in russian. Her voice was just as i imagined to be like if i knew her from a dream or a past life.The shock was still there we spoke like strangers but our eyes spoke like we had few lives together behind us.I asked her if she wants to go for a ride with the lifeguard boat, she refused just to show me where my place was, and that im not in control of the situation yet. My heart was pounding but there is no way i was backing off, so i proceeded to as her out after work hours gladly she left me without answer but gave me her instagram which was enough ""yes"" for me.The work day was over i went to gym like i did every other day for the entire summer, but i couldnt focus i was excited so much to see where this will go so i finished with my halfish training session and here i was on my mobile all sweaty not from training but from being nervous about going out tonight with this girl, that stranger i knew since forever, so i send her some casual icebrakers, i didnt want to look too cocky as i usually do.She agreed on going out with me and i asked what she prefers talk and drink on the beach in the night or go to clubs/bars and she chose beach and i hoped she did, loud bars and clubs end up in one night stands, and there was just something more in that girl.So we arranged a meeting in front of her hotel in 19:45 i was there 19:45 waited for her ~1 minute, as both of us knew that the game rules have changed and we aint playing.Here she was standing in front of me with her dark deep brown eyes, her amazing lips that looked so tasty i focused on them for a moment , and she knew what she had and she smiled in approval.The conversation started in an ease all the right questions followed by all the right answers, as we where proceeding to a very special place i had and i shared only with people i trusted because it had it all it was very close to the sea and no one ever went there because it was lifeguard area and it was hard to reach.So here we where some DeepHouse/ChillStep songs from my BT speaker some scotch in plastic cups and just two souls connecting after long time apart.I was amazed of how this girl was looking at life she was nothing like all the other girls i have spoke with and here is the time i will tell you her name...
Anna was a Belarusian girl from humble family on vacation in Bulgaria that was arranged by her brother as a gift for her 21th birthday.
...We continued drinking and speaking no on felt the need to take control or advantage over the other we where just two souls speaking and vibing on the same level no one was superior in any way.As the night was growing older and the scotch was getting lower, the excitement got me adventurous and i started getting  my clothes of not to make my move towards her but to go in for a night swim, i asked her if she was ""free enough"" to come and swim in the moonpath (we had a full-moon this night of course).She was a bit scared of the idea i jumped from the edge of  the lifeguard station and i here i was on the sand only with my underpants going towards the water with my back facing it because i had to see what she will do in the situation, she tried to jump too from the station but a bit unsure so i reached to help her and before i knew it my hands where on her ass (station was 10ft tall) helping her go down safely as i lowered her to the ground she stood in front of me looking me in the eye, it was the time for that so waited kiss but i thought if we are in the flow lets just make it a bit more interesting for her. and i turned around and started running towards the water i jumped and submerged and started swimming underwater just to make her uneasy and to play with her. 1-2 minutes after i emerged from water and there she was standing in knees deep refusing to get undressed and i had no problem with that because she looked amazing under the moonlight with her skirt not too short and her plain white shirt fitting her like it was made for her body exclusively.I proceeded towards her slowly fixing my hair playing with water making the moment longer for maximum affection and here i was in front of her wet , half-naked smelling like booze , sea-salt, and just enough leftover from my cologne to make the combination perfect. I asked her with deep voice if she was afraid to get wet in answer she just smiled and said she dont want to get her clothes wet, in that moment i grabbed her waist and pulled her towards me firmly she didnt mind that i made her all wet she was afraid and excited in the same time.As my hearth was allover the place i proceeded towards her tasty lips but just when i was about to kiss her i stopped and prolonged the moment giving her choice if she wants this or not... i looked in her eyes and i saw that she want this as much as i do and we kissed, it was not only a kiss it was a memory of something that happened before something that striked you once and disappeared leaving you searching , craving... it was a moment of reunion of two souls lost in past life it was my nirvana.We stayed like this for some time kissing under the moonlight knees deep in the sea.After we went back to the lifeguard station all wet and cold stayed together under one blanked to keep eachother warm... I craved her touch as she was kissing me gently i was answering with a bit harder bites just enough for her to feel the pain but enjoy it as well. I was losing control the urge to be closer to her was so gigantic i felt overwhelming need to fuck her, i wanted it so much but i was afraid that it may push her away, but at that point my mind was blurred by passion, booze and the sent of her skin, i started bite her neck kiss her shoulders she was seating in such way that her back was towards me she felt that my dick is hard and smiled playfully about it... in this moment i was sure we are fucking tonight and it will be the best night of my life.I turned her around and put her legs around my waist she was playing along in this time, i felt how wet she was when i touched the heart of her femininity, she was ready for me as much i was ready for her but no... she kept saying no, she said it needs to be more than this, and i knew its going to be more than this but i knew i cant make her believe it with words so i backed off. we kept cuddling and watching the moon that night.I went in my room somewhere in the morning few hours before work time (didnt sleep a minute).
I couldnt wait to go to my station i knew she was going to be there and her smile will cure all my pains.There i was opening my station looking at her hotel every few minutes expecting to spot her coming. It was few hours before she woke up and wrote me that she is coming soon, i felt relief.Here she was in all her grace going down the stairs slowly and after her was her brother who as you may have guessed was overprotective as fuck... so we acted a bit like nothing has happened the other night... She texted me if i want to go for a swim and before i saw what else she was texting i was galloping towards the water in such mather as if someone was drowning and im going in to save him. She followed right after but gracefully with patience a patience i didnt have at this time. The moment she stood in front of me i felt like my heart will stop , i took her hand underwater and pulled her towards me and started kissing her she didnt mind her brother looking and it was perfectly fine with me.We stayed in water for hour or so speaking again just this never ending conversations that i couldnt have with no one else and i knew her only for 24h.We spoke about books she likes and mysteries of the world.In all this time i was afraid to ask how much time is she going to stay in Bulgaria,but i had to and i did, the moment i asked the question her face went grey like if the alarm clock pulled her out of her dream on a monday morning.She said it was her last day here and we have to make it count, i needed a moment to stop all the thoughts that where flooding my mind, and i answered, ""YES!!!"" so the day continued we talked for some hours more kissing in the water hugging occasionally ass-grabbing boner play and just overall play with eachothers arousal.We made a plan for date but only this time it would be in a restaurant, and i knew the perfect place it was a small restaurant hanging over the sea on a cliff with some amazing view.And here i was waiting in the same place i waited last night but this time i was not nervous i felt like i wait for my girl as i was waiting for a person i knew since forever, dont get me wrong my heart was everywhere i felt it in my neck.The revolving door of the hotel was in motion and i felt a slight disappointment every time a person came out that was not her, the few minutes i waited felt like forever but in the end it was all worth it here she was once again stunning me from the second i see her, this time in tight grey dress again fitting her like if it was act of magic.We proceeded towards the restaurant which was a 20min walk away, those 20 minutes i cherish every day since, it was the time she just repeated everything that was going tru my head these 2 days , she said that it felt like we know each other from other life and that she feels some overwhelming emotion towards me that is a bit scary and exciting at the same time, that she was looking for me all her life and she dont  know what we should do once she goes back to Belarus, and we decided not to think about this until the last hour so we can enjoy every moment like if it was going to last for eternity, so here we are beautiful inlove and stupid in this amazing restaurant drinking white wine eating whatever the sea provides prepared with passion. Hours where flying and no wonder it was just like puzzle where i had half of the parts and she had the other everything just few in place, after the third bottle of wine we where drunk enough to go and do some stupid shit and enjoy it, so we went to the centre where all the clubs bars and places are and for few hours we keep bouncing from bar to bar dancing drinking shots kissing and just enjoying eachother to the fullest, and as we where ordering the next round of shots i caught her looking at me with wet eyes and i just froze in place i asked her what is wrong, she answered that she dont want this to end and that its not fair that we can have this only now at this moment i made a decision to not let this be only a summer fling and i said to her we will keep in touch and we wont let it die, after i said this she asked me if we can go back to ""our place"" it was the place on the beach we went last night, so we went the night was young so we had some time to be happy and sad in the same time.As we approached the place i was thinking of a way to fuck her brains out but in the same time to show her that i mean good that im not a fuckboy and that all i spoke about before was words from deep inside me. I wasnt able to think of something so i chose to go with the flow again we kissed a lot we spoke a lot... i started advancing towards her soaking wet pussy and this time she let me... i was so excited my dick was 110% hard my mind was blurred again by all the booze and the chemicals my brain was pouring from the overwhelming emotion this girl was provoking in me... i enjoyed every moan i enjoyed every bite so was she... in one time she gave up and grabbed my dick and started stroking it super slow as she was enjoying it as much as i do, she never broke eye contact with me she knew exactly how she make me feel and she was high on that feeling.She made me cum in some minutes and said that its all i will get for now. I felt like a little boy but still i fell even further inlove with her. The other morning i felt like crap i knew she will come on the beach for 1-2 hours and after she will go back to Belarus and who knows what will happen. So i got to the beach and waited for her she came we spoke she dropped i tear and something in me broke and tears where running down my cheeks she started smiling with wet eyes we laughed together without too many words we understanded how beautiful stupid and perfect the situation is... It was time... I was saying goodbye to the best thing that ever happened in my life (tear goes down my cheek now writing this).I was standing there watching how she goes back the stairs for the last time the same stairs i watched with hope i now watch with broken heart i knew its not the end but still it felt so bad, the moment i lost sight of her i sat on my station looking at the sea with a bit of disgust i wanted to ask it where all its beauty went. Few days i stayed numb didnt ate much didnt slept much, the brief moments we text or speak make the pain go away but it was just a short pain relief, after the pain was coming back stronger and stronger... one week like this got me questioning all my decisions before i understood that i was focusing on the wrong shit in life...After that one week i got to conclusion that i was ready to regret my decision but i was not ready to not make a decision and have questions without answers all my life. So i called Anna and asked her how we can see each other soon and we spoke about it she was super excited and i asked if its ok if i come to Belarus and she was so into it... But for Belarus i need visa and it would have taken more time that both we wanted to wait. So we decided that she come again because its easier and the plan was there... I felt so good of the idea that somewhere in the time i have a date in which i will see her eyes again it made waiting easier.So i find this nice place in Bulgaria - Velingrad its ""The SPA Capital of EU"" (as said in ad :D) i booked a room for 6 days... 
The date was 13 Sep. The airport.Waiting. My heart is pounding i still cant believe this girl will come again to see a guy she met for 2 days in a summer vacation, it was just surreal. 
...The door of the airport GATE opens some old lady with funny hat with her little dog and her little grandson... it open again several times every time mini heart attack... and finally it was her i havent seen her in quite a while but she was there it was her the girl from the beach the girl from my past life the missing part...
She looks at me with confusion the same happens with me i can only guess she felt the same like me its overwhelming emotions in all directions its like some wicked drug hits you in all the right places , in my head is ""noodle soup"" i dont know what to do should i run and hug her should i cry should i smile and i felt like i want to do all this simultimously...and i did i was smiling and crying but her hair was all over my face and its all that mattered.As we where going towards my friends car(he was going to drive us to Velingrad and after take us back)we couldnt brake eye contact it was so surreal that we where afraid that if we look somewhere else even for the slightest moment it will disappear like a mirage in scourged desert.We sat in the back of the car just speaking with eyes kissing and being grateful for being able to feel alive again.We went to the hotel it was all nice and the room was amazing (will provide videos and photos).So we made a plan to get dressed and go to take food in the hotels restaurant and we almost did... so im getting dressed putting some shirt with my black slim jeans while she was putting make up, i was staying there ready and watching her put make up in the mirror when suddenly she looked at me tru the mirror and winked... This got me mental i lost all control and just took her by the waist and threw her on the bed she looked me with excitement and for a mere moment i was all over her i dont even remember removing her clothes or mine i just remember when i start going down from her neck towards her breasts down the stomach and slowly approaching the core... The moment my dick managed to reach the sweet spot she grabbed my head and forced it deep inside her i was so into it and she was so wet i continued to eat her out until she came after that i turned her around on her stomach put a pillow under it and started going inside her very slow while kissing her back and going towards her neck only when i reached her ear i started talking dirty and penetrated her fully i felt her storm of emotions when she clinged my dick with her thighs she wanted me as bad as i wanted her and all else ceased to exist in that exact moment... For the next six days it was all pure passion nothing unnecessary... order food for the room bottle of wine every now and then. primal fucking, throw some ""I love you"" and that cute little girl that i grew so fond of just became everything i have ever dreamed about, she was good talk good fuck good vibes she had it all, but like anything good it had to end sometime.
Here we are again at the same airport that gave me everything now waits there grey and cold to take it back away, we stood for 2 hours until her gate was almost closed , just staying together looking in eachothers eyes just replaying all the moments we have just experienced in these six days.""LAST CALL FOR...""  The voice on the speaker yelled with ugly voice as if it was some stone cold judge in a court serving the death sentence to you for something you didnt do... but this time i knew we have future and that gave me energy to change my life entirely to want to be better for her we saw again around Christmas and our next meeting will be in april when i will go to Belarus to meet with her parents and pop the question. I text a lot with her best friend and we teamed up to make everything possible. The problem here is i dont make enough money for everything i need for the proposal but i work my ass off and i hope all will be good i Work on 2 jobs and try to buy and resell some shit in order to get some cash for the ring and surprise... Wish me LUCK. ",romance

"First of all, sorry for my bad english it is not my first language. However, i really need some platform to express my thought and dont want my girlfriend to know about it. 

Since we started our relationship three years ago, my girlfriend kept complaining about my hygiene problems, mainly for scalp scabs, ear wax problems. I am getting paranoid about those problems and also worry about my body odour. 
I used antiperspirants in the summer and ensure i took bath and washed my hair every single time before i went out for a date with my girlfriend. But still, she still complaining about the ear wax and the scalp scabs. Sometime those problems improved for a brief period of time, and they eventually came back. 
Today, when i attending her family meeting, she complained about my feet hading bad smell .....i felt so frustrating. 
i dont know if she have mysophobia or am i really dirty and having bad hygiene 

we are together for three years and will get married soon. However, i felt she is more like my mother rather than my girlfriend/wife......
she did also complain about some of my habit, like i sometime dont take bath and just go to sleep directly after a night shift / afternoon shift (because for afternoon shift, i arrived home at 0000, and i needed to get up and go to work at 0645 for morning shift.....it is really fucking tired ....). However, her argument is that i worked in hospital and it is full of germs and bacteria. I know she is correct, but it is just too tired, i cannot resist to fall into sleep directly at the moment that i arrived home. I worked as a radiographer (aka. Radiological technician in america) in a rediculously busy hospital, and it involve a lot of manual handling on elderly patients. It is just so tired when i am offduty...

Now, i even dont want to date her when i finished morning shift, because i afraid that i will smell badly after a whole day of work ....

I dont know shall i talk with her or shall i change my lifestyle really ....I dont want to lose her, but she complained about my body shape, ear wax, scalp scabs, feet, teeth colour. It kind of making me feeling that i am worthless ...

"I have a crush on this guy in my class. His friends ask really weird questions that I found out have to do with him and they act really weird when I talk to him or when I’m near him.

When I’m talking to my friends, and he’s not part of our conversation he’ll insert himself into it, or repeat something I said, to one of his friends.

"Hello there. I haven't posted here before, but I would like to comment on a few things I've noticed from my peers. This would more or less be a sort of vent, but I'm *not trying at all to be negative*.

If you want love,  your main priority is *not romance* in the relationship. It's *longevity*. Romance is just one of the many ways to keep the relationship fresh or interesting. Romance on its own *should not be a crutch*.

Keep in mind that this ranty post isn't on the sub either. From what I've seen, this sub is doing just fine. In fact, romance can help open up a relationship.
However, I would assert that once you get close to them, romance should be put on the back burner unless it's agreed upon.

Too many times I see people around me relying on romance because *they don't understand the person they're with*. Once again, romance should only be used if you *know* that your lover is the romantic type, but not as a last resort to try to prove to your partner you love them.

My perspective may be skewed because I am only a teenaged boy, so I would love any and all feedback.

"As the season of love, Valentine Day is around so the obvious question is “how to make him or her happy and surprised to take our love to another level ?”

And the real happiness lies in making others happy.

As said by Someone: “A good Life is a collection of happy Moments !”
Here are some ways to Woo your beloved on this Valentine Season:

1. One Rose says more than the Words! Put a strong impression of your Love by gifting a bunch of Red Rose and capture the smile on your partner’s face .

2. Why not give him/her a memorable gift ? The greatest gifts are not wrapped in paper but in love ! Whats best other than jewellery or accessories. Jewellery is the exclamation point of a girls outfit and same way accessories for men.

3. Add Some Sweetness to your love by variety of Chocolates. All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn’t hurt !

4. Give your Love the Token Of Promise, the promise to be with him/her for life time. But do not Forget to give a Hug ! They invented hug to let people know that you love them without saying anything.

5. The best gift you can give to someone is your Time ! Feel the Warmth of love and celebrate your cute and Personel moments with your partener by booking a Special Date OR short trip to some romantic place.

6. Book a candle night dinner and Spend Quality Time with your love and Celebrate the season of love and make the life time memories.

"I just want to put this question out there for discussion. I [did a post about it](https://jackfisherbooks.com/2018/02/10/do-soul-mates-actually-mates-exist/) on my blog recently, mostly with respect to how the concept of soul mates affects writing romance novels. But after writing it, it felt like one of those topics that deserved a wider discussion.

I made clear in my post that I don't buy into the concept, but I do believe in the concept of a special kind of love that blossoms between two people as they grow together. You might say that's no different than the concept of a soul mate, but that's just me.

What do you all think about the concept? Does it affect how you go about pursuing romance? I look forward to the discussion.",romance

"I could write a 500 page book on this woman, but I'll spare you the pain and keep it simple.
(Also, I hate the name Patrick, that's what my mom was going to call me, so my friends started saying it because I hate it. These passages come from my own personal journal, and aren't edited because I'm lazy)

Faith is the most special, fragile, yet incredibly headstrong girl I have ever met. She is smarter than me, incredibly funny, and even stunning at times. She can be so adorable when wearing my jacket. For someone so fragile physically, she is the most untouchable person emotionally I have ever met. I admire (or enjoy) all of these characteristics. But beyond that, she's even better just to be around. She is so innocent yet not at the same time, you never know what you're gonna get with Fai. Like yesterday (11/28/17) after we had gotten home, I was showing Grant how light she was, and I was gonna pick her up, and she sees this and just wraps her legs around my waist as if that's perfectly normal. Then, when she's down, insists on a piggy back ride. Physical contact is her thing; I find it awkward, and she uses that to her advantage. If she's ever upset that she didn't get her way, she'll give it one last shot with a pouty face and a ""pwease Patwick?"" Before just forcing the physical contact. So basically she just lays on me till she gets her way. Lately she's added another last resort, the cold shoulder. In other terms, I'm ""whipped"" by my friend.
I guess this needs to be out there. Faith and I flirt. We don't intend to flirt, but we do. We also argue ""like an old married couple"". We overall, act a lot like a couple. We kinda cuddle, always touching when together, argue like an old married couple, flirt, and know each other well enough to make references that fly right over anyone else's heads. Sometimes I get the self awareness to see it too. Such as last night (11/28/17) when after the scholar's bowl meet Fai was telling MY embarrassing stories, while saying ""It's okay Patrick"" and running her fingers through my hair just the way I like. However, I chalk this up to our social awkwardness, rather than Fai liking me. I do see how we would look like a couple though. We do everything I've already said, we have what from the outside looks like pet names for each other, are each other's top bestfriends on snapchat, she pretty much has a reservation for my jacket, are always calling each other different forms of hoe, and are nigh inseparable at times. Even from the inside one can tell our relationship isn't normal. But honestly, that's why I love Faith and I's relationship so much; It's rather fitting. Neither of us are normal, so why should our relationship be? Just because it's an abnormal relationship doesn't mean it's a romantic one. People just don't understand that part. They find it so hard to understand that we aren't a couple, even though we act like one. ",romance

"Hey all, first time posting on reddit. I was hoping for some input on a love letter I'm sending to a girl I have had a charged friendship with for several years. I essentially lay everything out in the letter if you have any questions let me know.

Dearest T,

I’m sorry if I did something the other night that put you off. That being said I just wanted to put my feelings onto paper so that hopefully you would understand.
    I have known you for the better part of 8 years, even though we didn’t really talk to one another in Jr. High other than from musicals. When I saw your post from way back when and decided to message you, it was not by any stretch out of pity. At that time you were more mature than me and you gave me an ideal. You inspired me to better myself at first, and through that I was able to grow to the point where I could care about myself. Previous to our date I had only ever been on awkward dates that were no fun at all, because of that it blew me away when we had so much fun so easily. We hung out a few more times and talked every night. Each day adding to my motivation, fueling my fire.
    Not too much longer after that you got back together with Gavin and I was a bit confused but I understood. There was no anger or anything of that nature in my heart. Then I moved up to Ogden, we kept in touch but it always seemed strained so I decided to focus on growth as an individual and left you to do whatever you wanted to do for the rest of your senior year.
    The summer of 2016 I took a big risk and decided to take a job on the other side of the country. This job tore me down and stripped me of any confidence I had built up over the last year since being an adult. I was rejected everyday, sometimes close to a hundred times per day. It got to the point where I was barely able to eat. At my lowest point over there I decided to hop on facebook and I saw that you were hurting too. I decided to message you just to say hey and see how you were holding up. For the next few weeks you kept me going. Just you messaging me and being nice to me when nobody else was, was enough for me to stay out on the doors. The thought of you made me want to be as successful as I could be, so that I could come back home having made enough money just to spoil you. In the end I buckled under the pressure and couldn’t go on any longer. By a stroke of magnificent luck I made it back to (REDACTED) without too much struggle.
    When I got back however,  the only thing I could think about was taking you out. We ended up going to 25th street and just walking around. That day still stands out in my mind as one of my favorite dates just because I could tell you cared at least a bit. I know I should have kissed you in that cave, and who knows what could have happened. Nonetheless when it came time for your graduation party, you having gotten back together with Gavin, I was still a shell of who I was before I left but I decided to go regardless of my feelings for you just to wish you luck and prosperity. 
I even now harbor no ill will towards you. I’m sure you didn’t realize how much you helped me but I wanted you to know that no matter what happens, no matter where life takes us, I will always care about you. You have inspired me many times to push myself to grow. You were the only source of light when my world was at its darkest. I can’t just idly sit by when I know you’re in so much pain.
    I know that you’ve said you’re a grenade but honestly T. I would jump on that grenade for you in a heartbeat. I owe a lot of who I have become, to you. You may believe that you’re beyond help but you’re not. I don't want to change you, I want to be there for you, to listen and hear about what’s stressing you out or what’s making you happy, to show you the light that you’ve shown me and to make you smile big toothy smiles so I can see the adorable gap in your teeth. I believe in the person you want to become. I know that you need space and I’m more than willing to give you as much as you need but please, let me be there for you like you were there for me. 
                    Cordially yours, and always extra

"Bf (m35) and I (f30) went engagement ring shopping and although I did not want a solitaire we ended up buying one. The process itself went smooth and although I was hesitant, as I did not want a solitaire, the thoughts of being his wife, starting our life together, and the international symbolism of that solitaire won me over. 

Then my feelings changed even before we left the parking lot. While we were purchasing the ring he mentions he could have spent more money, explaining that while he doesn’t have a problem spending money on iPhoneX (which I would never dream of doing so) he does with the ring. Then while in the parking lot, again he tells me that he could’ve spent more money. At this point, I tell him, “babe, please don’t tell me that.”  

He makes good money and just from his perspective, because it is between him and I, I felt cheap or undervalued. I’m a pretty frugal because I spend responsibly and don’t consider myself a materialistic person at all, but his comments made me think twice. Between the both of us he is definitely the spender. It also doesn’t help that his mom once complimented me on my “cheapness.”

Are my feelings valid? Or, am I just being too sensitive. The more I think about it, the more I think these feelings may be rooted in our financial security as a couple, and how we choose to spend money and hence place value on things. ",romance

"My sister, her girlfriend, and I are planning to drive down from North Carolina to Universal Studios in Florida in a couple of days (just before Christmas). A few months ago my sister told me of her plans to propose to her girlfriend while we were down there because they're both super into Harry Potter. Just a few minutes ago her girlfriend told me she was planning to propose to my sister during the same trip! Neither know what the other one is planning, but I now know about both of their plans. My sister has a loose schedule in place, but her girlfriend is going to wing it. I'm very excited about this happening!

My question is: are there any shenanigans I can get up to? Nothing mean but just for my own amusement. Any jokes I can make that won't spoil the secret for either of them? Should I tell my sister, who has more of a plan set up, about her what her girlfriend told me? There is no doubt in either of their minds that the other person would say no, and I wouldn't want to do that joke anyway.

Any suggestions? :)",romance

"So, I try to make this short: About a year ago I met the one. She was in an unhappy relationship back then (that had lasted about 3 years). We fell in love, they broke up, he moved out, we started a relationship. These things took time, as she had a really hard time addressing these things to him. B ut our relationship was in a good place. Now, suddenly, she panics, feels depressed (some job and money problems) and tells me that she only now realizes that she hasn't really worked through all her emotional baggage from the last relationship. Not that she's still in love with the guy, she's not, but also not really in a place where she can give a lot of energy to the relationship. She says she needs time to work through it, but she doesn't want to ask me to wait for her, even says it might be better if we cut it off. Now, for two weeks, no contact at all. I asked her the last time we spoke, if it's possible that she will regret the decision. She says yeah, could be.

I know that it's a mistake. The relationship was not broken at all. We're a crazy good match. And we already worked through tons of shit. But what can I do? How do I give her space, without disappearing completely and without digging a grave for our relationship?",romance
"
	The smell of blood permeated the dark room. The body lay lifeless on the floor. Given the small space, the salty, coppery smell was unmistakable. I stood against the wall trying to distance myself from the grotesque scene playing out before me. My gaze moved down to the floor watching the pool of dark crimson liquid growing larger and nearing my Jimmy Choo’s. I stepped to the side avoiding the advancing blood and tried to keep my food down. At times like this in my job, I try my best to tune out and focus on something..happier. Most of the time it doesn’t work. Like now. All I hear is the second man being interrogated and tortured whenever he doesn’t answer correctly. I can’t imagine what he is feeling right now. But given the accusations, he does deserve it. I glanced up seeing tall men on either side of me, their hands behind their backs. It’s not like I’m going anywhere. If I do, I’ll either be blackmailed or killed. My whole body jolted as a shot fired and I heard the thud. That sure didn’t last long. I kept my gaze down to the floor as even more blood painted the surface. 
“We are done here,” a low husky voice said. Black Oxford shoes walked past mine and the door opened. “Lena.” He demanded. Everytime he talks to me, a shiver runs through my spine. And not in the good way. 
“Yes, Boss, “ I answered quickly. I turned and followed after him. Now you must be thinking. How the hell did I get in this situation? Have you ever regretted a decision you made?  In my case it was a couple months back. I wanted to be a freelance photojournalist taking the jobs only I wanted. But then my old boss hired me for one last job, the wrong job, and shit went downhill from there.

Chapter 1
Lena

A few months ago. 
I woke up from my deep slumber, the sun hitting my eyes instantly. Guess I forgot to pull down the blinds again.  My eyes were irritated from the glaring light. I sat up in my cotton sheets, sliding out of bed and rubbing my feet on my furry white rug. I glanced over at my nightstand. 6:00 a.m. Sometimes I really just want to go back to sleep and never go outside in public again. But there is a thing called a job and bills that will not pay themselves. I groaned in annoyance and stood up ruffling my long, wavy, black hair that stopped almost at my waist. After doing my normal routine of brushing my teeth, washing my face and taking a quick shower, I got ready for my work day. I work for a private investigator - for now - since he is doing a case about recent murders happening in the city. I guess you could say I am an investigator too given I’m taking the photos. But sometimes I really am worried that I’m going to get shot one of these days. I walked over to my dresser and pulled out a simple white v neck, a black hoodie and some denim washed skinny jeans. After I pulled on all my clothes, I tied the laces of my black converse extra tight today. I glimpsed over at the mirror on my wall fixing a few strands of my hair pulling them behind my ears. My pale skin and brown eyes stared back at me. I checked the time on my phone and cursed, grabbing my backpack. It had my Canon, a few rolls of film, charger, and some notes. ",romance

"**tl;dr* - I got slammed by bunch of people on fetlife calling me a creep, I got drunk because of it, and made an ass out of myself. Now I'm scared to death I'm going to lose one of the best things that has ever happened to me and I have no idea what to do

**EDIT 01** - I'm aware I'm an ass. You don't have to downvote my post. How about maybe giving some advice?

**EDIT 02**  - The girl is independently wealthy and can leave whenever she wants This is in no way an attempt to force/extort physical contact from here. Please read my post in detail.

**The Story**
I posted an ad for a free room for a pretty girl. She moved in and things went extremely well and we got a long really well and started having sex. We have the same psychological damage and history and our personalities go together really well.

She is bi and was open to a threesome so I posted an ad to Fetlife. Got absolutely destroyed for being a creepy perv, I have personal image issues, it affected me deeply. When I'm hurt that badly, I pretty much always drink.

So I did. I drank until I blacked out. Apparently I flipped out on the girl saying she wasn't very caring because all these people just shit on me and she couldn't even be bothered to stick her head in and see if I was OK. I mean I know we just met but is that expecting too much? Just to stop in and see if I'm OK? Anyway, it ended with me kicking her out saying she was mean and cold and just made me feel worse because she didn't care. Or so I'm told, I don't remember any of this.

I woke up the next day and remembered nothing. She was gone, half her stuff was still here. It looked like she left in a hurry. I just assumed she had decided I was a creep or something and left. I can get pretty dark when I medicate being triggered with alcohol.

I felt terrible. I had no idea what had happened. I remembered nothing except that I started drinking early that day because I hurt so bad. She eventually shows up and we talk and she seems OK. I am actually shocked and in disbelief. In a bout of drunkenness, I said who-knows-what to this woman and she is back, and she doesn't seem even remotely phased by what happened. She spent the night in her car. I am utterly astounded by this reaction. I mean that, in the most literally sense, I could not believe that she was not at least a little mad about what I put her through. It was beyond comprehension. She said it was because I ""was a good person"".

So after a couple days I realize she doesn't like to touch me anymore. Whenever I touch her she pulls away. If I try to hug her she breaks the hug. Whenever she crawled into bed, she would always make it a point to touch me, even with a toe, which she stopped doing. She would always fall asleep in my arms. I am not super surprised after what I did; I didn't expect everything to go back to normal after 1 night. I can't imagine I am the most favorite person int he world to her at the moment.

After a few days, in the least threatening way I can possibly muster using the most gentle words and tone of voice I can think of, I tell her that when she does that, it hurts. It's a trigger and I'm already triggered by what happened on Fetlife and it's making everything so much harder. I told her, again without threat and in the gentlest tone, that I have limits. I can only take so many of those punches before I won't be able to handle it anymore and if we get to that point, she will have to move. I made sure to be clear that I did not want that, and to make sure she knows she will not just be kicked out into the cold, she will have time to save money etc to get out in as safe and comfortable a manner as possible (I am not a c**t), but she can't continue to live here because she'll just remind me of how repulsive she thinks I am; I can't handle that. I fight those demons every day; I can't live with someone who gives them ammo.

A couple days pass and things are greatly improved. She is touching me again and not recoiling. I don't expect things to be perfect but at least this this part isn't making it 300x harder to process all the other stuff and work through that.

Then she goes back to being the same way. Not really touching me. Pulling away. I try to talk to her but I don't ever get anything but (what strike me as) excuses and lies, not the truth about what's going on.

One night I suggest a remote-controlled vibrator as a way to maybe spice things up again. She says ""well why don't we have sex instead"". So we did. She gave me an HJ that screamed ""when will this be over already"". The look on her face made me feel disgusting and repulsive, and as such I couldn't get hard. I played nice and smiled and blamed it on an ADHD medicine I take that can caused ED. So she asks me if its OK if she gets off. I'm hurt and I feel disgusting and would much prefer maybe if she did something that make me feel like she wanted me to be in the same room with her, but I don't want to make it weird so again I smile and say ""sure"" and hand her the toy and she gets herself off, then hands me back the toy to be put away. She says something about ""better luck next time"" and then rolls over and goes to sleep. I am left feeling utterly worthless and disgusting and emasculated (because I couldn't get hard).

Last night I went to bed with her and put my foot on hers and she turned over on her side into a little ball and stayed in a little corner of the bed. That one hurt really, really bad. So I got pissed, and yelled that if she does not ship off to the Marines on 1/2 as planned she will have 30 days after that to find some place else to live. I grabbed blankets and pillows and went and slept in the living room.

This morning I spoke to her and apologized for yelling what I did through the door last night and wanted to try again while I'm calmer. Again, in the plainest, gentlest language possible I told her the problem; that when she pulls away from me it hurts a lot. I told her I did the best job I could explaining to her how much it hurt and I apologized if I did a poor job explaining it. I told her I do not want her to move, that I do enjoy her company, and I want things to continue but I cannot continue with the way things are. I don't even touch her any more because I can't handle it when she draws away from me. And now when she touches me, I feel like it's pity or something and not affection or desire. I told her if she wants to stay that's the problem that needs to be fixed - she doesn't have to touch me if she doesn't want to but she has to stop making me feel repulsive.

I have no idea what to do. It's likely this relationship is destroyed. I take responsibility for it, I know what happens when I get triggered and then drink but I was so hurt by what the people on Fetlife said to me I wasn't thinking. I don't know what to do. I really like her and she says she likes me, but her body language says she can't stand me and thinks I'm slime.

Please help.

"I met a girl a couple years ago when I was visiting my friend who lived in Colorado.  We started making out within a few minutes and ended up hanging out and talking all night.  Part of the conversation was asking each other questions about our lives, another part was repeatedly complimenting each other, and part was just laughing at nothing for long periods of time.  It was great.  Towards the end of the night, she confessed that she just recently broke up with her ex boyfriend and wasn't sure what was going to happen with him.  I understood completely because I had dealt with a couple tough breakups before and understood where she was coming from.  We hung out for the rest of the night as friends, and it was still great.

I didn't get her number or last name because I didn't want to disrespect her ex boyfriend that she was unsure about, and my friend ended up moving so I haven't been able to see whatever happened with her and that guy.  Also, I remember that she had like a flip phone, so I'm assuming she didn't have any social media, haha.  As far as I know, she might not even remember me because this was so long ago.  Anyways, I am never usually infatuated by random girls, but I still think about her a lot.  It's a weird feeling- I know I'm never going to see her again, but I still wonder what she's up to and how she's doing.  I haven't said anything to anyone because they'll think it's weird, but like I said, I ruminate about her pretty frequently.

So we swim for a bit (me and my friend), and then I take one of the floats and put it on my neck and start swimming. Then my friend comes and gets on my back and starts saying ""swim you taxi."" Then his sister comes and says "" I want to get on"" so I say to get onto my friend and then she does and we swim for a bit. Then her friend's mom comes and says they're going, but she doesn't pay much attention. Then my friend goes to get something, and she swims really fast and grabs me from behind and tightly clings on to my back with her legs wrapped around mine and her arms tight around my chest. She puts her head down on my shoulder and says ""Start swimming."" So I do, and then my friends come and he thinks were just messing about so he gets on. Then he lets go and bomb into the pool a few times while she is still clinging on to me. She then starts moving her feet up my thighs and nearly touching my p***s. So I quickly shift her legs back down. When I told her to let go she let go but quickly grabbed back onto me. She was wearing a bikini so I felt her boobs pressing against my back. But after a while she came onto my front and pressed up hard. Then we just got out of the pool. She kept talking a lot with me too afterwards. She also kept insisting that I get on her back while we were swimming. She kept pulling my hand to get on her.",romance
"The phrase, ""You complete me"" is one of the quickest ways to turn my die-hard romanticism off.  This phrase insinuates that a person has to have somebody else to feel complete.  A relationship should be two beings shining brightly who positively feed each other energy.  Think of two circles next to each other spinning in opposite directions.  Or think of how an infinity sign moves.

It's okay to have someone be your life partner and they fulfill some of your needs, but to constitute that they are needed so you feel ""complete"" is subjugating yourself to a spiritual growth block.  You should be able to be happy by yourself before getting into a relationship.

As a side note, many people get into relationships and settle for somebody who tolerates them, shows them enough love, but does not force them to grow.  It's usually at this time that people stop growing because they are being unconditionally loved to the point of coddling.  Think about how many parents or relationships you know who have stopped developing as beings because they found someone who matches what I described.

If you disagree that's fine too! Let me hear what you got.  I love all of you beautiful beings of light. Namaste",romance

"Hey reddit, im new to this and im sure its not the most proper place to do what im doing but Idk what else to do. I guess using this as a release, but a release to not be alone. I already feel that. No. This is not a cry for help. Yet a pillow to rest head on. My name is Matt im 25 years old. Ive been through alot of things in my life; from being a stupid teenager doing drugs that would corrupt whom I was as a person, to making poor life decisions that lead to a health decline, my fathers passing to going through different girlfriends with betrayals, cheating, lying etc. I even thought I had felt love for the first time with the woman I lost my virginity with which was only 4 years ago. [Life events didnt happen in that order] But it all lead up to me eventually having to live with my sister which is where I ended up meeting the woman I am deathly in LOVE with. First I met her brother and we ended up being great friends. One night she came out and when I seen her my heart stopped. All my problems went away; my depression, my low feeling in life because of where I was, the world around me froze and I looked into her deep beautiful eyes and was instantly locked. I knew. I knew this is the woman I am suppose to be with. She is so loving, caring, affectionate, made me feel good, smart, and absolutely amazingly beautiful in my eyes. This was the woman I had cried looking for in my dreams, this was the woman that had my heart in such a tight grasp that my heart burst. I got the chance to go out with her and her brother on her 25th birthday which I did. Out of everyone she asked me if I would dance with her. So I did. After that night it was a snowball of love until we broke up the first time. We got back together pledging things would be better. Things were better, and only improving. Yet I made a few mistakes and got a bit stale so we ended up drifting apart again. I know I messed up. But ive realized now what I did. I wasnt being a man and standing up to change like I should. I was content working at Mcdonalds making shit money and living with my mom. After this breakup and my recent fathers passing I thought nothing in this world could detour me anymore, when I was wrong. Not even 2 weeks after this I got fired from Mcdonalds. Im trying my hardest to apply for jobs now opening my experience. I want to learn new things. I want to get into school, I want to get into the gym, I want to become successful. But with all this; theres one thing. I love her so much I want her to be there with me through it. She is my bestfriend even now...even though we dont talk. Which is my accord because im so in love with her it would be hard to be friends. I guess where im going with this guys. I just wish she would understand the things I'd do for her. Anything. I wish I could have her back. Everyone says well maybe shes not the one. Youre wrong. Shes the one. I just think I met her at the wrong time. I'm in love with this woman and I cant love anyone else even if I wanted to. I tried. We have and had a great relationship us breaking up is because I got lazy. How do people deal with the way I feel and not want to hurt themselves? Im at the lowest point in my life and I just want her so that I can feel high again. I miss and love you so much Carmen. I hope you realize someday how much you mean to me.

"“Don’t let that get away, Don’t let that slip away, Don’t let that love escape” the chorus seemed to echo within my head as I stood holding the pole in the bus. I stared into the distance seeing familiar stores pass, yet thinking why I couldn’t see her as often. “Yo” my friend David snapped his fingers at my face, it was already his stop. I dapped his hand and he wrapped his arm around Amy’s waist. “see you around man, and good luck with Jacey”. He winked and left with Amy as I plugged my earbuds back in thinking about my situation. I was getting a bit tired of seeing other couples being in love as I couldn’t even indulge in my own and yet continued declaring I was in love. It was a couple of months back when I was invited to David’s party, we had been friends for a while and had grown close to become brothers. There was no way I wouldn’t accept and celebrate with him, although I found unexpected guests at his party. An unfamiliar group crowded around the backyard while my schoolmates lounged in the living room. However my mind wasn’t on that, first I immediately headed towards the drinks. “Oh Vodka and rum this time not bad” during my high school years I had become somewhat a drinker, and it was one of the top reasons I came to celebrate. I mixed myself some Vodka with orange juice and settled in the living room, mingling around with familiar faces. I turned to my friend AJ “Yo what’s up with the group down at the back”? He turned to see, and came back to reply “Oh their David’s elementary friends, apparently everyone in his elementary was tight so they got invited too”. “Say word” I saw in that small group a few girls, and they were pretty good on my scale especially one that I had my eye on. I turned back to AJ “Where’s the food man”. “At the back big boy”. “say less, Ima fill myself up right now ”. I headed towards the backyard downing more of my cup. Confidence took place of my usual dead attitude, and I focused on my newfound mission. As I entered the backyard I made small eye contact and continued to help myself to food. AJ settled to my left “Eyeing some sweeties?”. “You know me well”. I continued the idle chatter with AJ and simply placed bets that their group would eventually move onto the same table. My bet paid off as 5 minutes later we had a full table of unfamiliar faces. A girl to my left broke the ice “So how much did you drink Aaron”. It was Alexis, a familiar face. “I’ll have you know I’m still quite sober, by the way how do you know these guys?”. She shook her head “I came from the same elementary as David, so we are all elementary friends here idiot”. Well that was new, I didn’t know they came from the same elementary. But my attention started focusing heavily onto the girl in the middle, an unfamiliar face and yet… I had a feeling I knew who she was. She was pretty, with her makeup done properly and yet showing her naturally tanned skin. A Filipino for sure. As I started up conversation and slightly showed more interest towards her, I learned her name was Jacey. And by the end of the night and few more drinks I had her contact information saved onto my phone. Casual talks on Snapchat turned to flirting and it was made clear we were interested. Funny enough I realized why I found her to be familiar as David had been trying to set me up with a girl from his elementary last year, and she was the same girl. We never got to it last year, so we barely knew each other. Fast forward some more and now we were in a relationship. The only problem? Distance. She lived quite a distance and being a high school student, driving was out of the option. It was true I was somewhat lazy in my efforts to visit, but the bigger problem was that both of us were busy on days we were free, as I had extracurricular music classes and she worked 2 jobs as well as was involved with school clubs. Going to different schools meant we never saw each other until we arranged it, and our only form of communication were through our phones. We were never really talkers so we wouldn’t call, instead we asked each other about our days through snapchat and checked up on one another when we could. However, I still remembered the few times we met, and they burned in my head. The classic cheesy memories that I strived for with tinged bits of romance. The art show last week was good I thought, but she was best piece that I saw that night. I had somehow gotten the nerve to pullout roses and officialise us. I asked in a rather cryptic  way , and thought that a second attempt may be in order to properly convey my feelings. However my feelings flickered as the touch I experienced that day simply made me yearn for more, and yet they would not be satisfied until the next date. The distance had me reconsidering what I was getting into, and whether the feelings I held onto were worth fighting for. In honesty I didn’t even completely know this girl and simply held my belief in her genuineness and hardworking attitude. I was scared, as this would be the first time I was holding a true relationship instead of all the half assed affairs I held in my past. “So tonight you should go and take a chance with her, She could be everything you wanted. Everything you wanted. Don’t let that get away, Don’t let that slip away, Don’t let that love escape”. The chorus rang into my ears once more, and my smile to those lines solidified my feelings that this would be worth it. I couldn’t let someone so perfect get away over some small doubts could I?",romance

"OKAY SO IF YOU HAVE TIME TO LISTEN TO THIS STORY GATHER AROUND AND LISTEN UP:

It started in the fifth grade.
My friend Mila and I decided to go to the beach together. I thought we were going to be going to the nearby public each but instead we went to her cousin's private community beach. A fifth grade boy our age kept on talking to her at the beach I was like ""EXCUSE ME DO I KNOW YOU SHE'S MY FRIEND NOT YOURS."" Turns out that boy was her cousin, Rohan. (Of course I didn't know that though) So I hated Rohan and he hated me back for a while, because we each thought we were being ""replaced"" by the other. As the years went by I forgot about the boy at the beach. And then, I met him again at her Chinese New Year family party in the eighth grade. We were both taller than when we had been, but he was a little bit taller than me. I talked to him and Mila the whole time, and we laughed, and ate and watch videos together. A month or so after that day, Mila asked me during a sleepover.
""Do you like Rohan?"" 
I hadn't really thought about it. The fact that I liked him. I mean, yeah, I liked him as a friend, but as a..... love interest? There was a part of me that was confused, but there was also a part of me that screamed yes. So, foolishly, I decided to listen to that one part of me screaming yes. 
""Yeah"" I simply replied, and before I fell asleep I heard her voice say, ""I support you""

____________________________________________________________ SOME TIME LATER ______________________________ 
Rohan was going to have a graduation bonfire at the beach. And I was invited. At this point, I was hopelessly in love, and so I decided, HECK I'M GOING TO CONFESS TO HIM. I texted Mila right away, and of course she dared me that I wouldn't. Even though I knew deep inside that I probably wouldn't, I decided to tell her I would. We worked on the confession for a month, planning everything so that it was perfect. The plan was a stupid one, looking back, but it was a plan nevertheless. The plan was this: Mila would announce that she had to go to the bathroom, and everyone would go with her and that would be the time for me to confess. (OH GOD) The confession was to be about 8:00. The day of the bonfire, I was feeling pumped. I was ready. I could do this. I was a strong-willed person. However, when we arrived to the beach at 4:30, I could already feel the sinking dread of what I had signed up for. As the time rolled by, I checked my phone. It was 7:30, I had 30 more minutes to go.
""I'm going to go to the bathroom.""
WHAT. THE. FUCK. (there goes my 30 minutes)
I said in a small voice, 
""Yeah me too.""
Mila turned toward me and said through a gritted smile, 
""YOU ARE STAYING RIGHT HERE DON'T FUCK THIS UP.""
*ahhh true friendship*
And so, I sat on the bench near the bonfire as I watched my friends recede into the distance. I watched as my friends disappeared and Rohan walked over to sit next to me. 
My heart was like TIME TO CONFESS. My brain however, had forgotten every single word I was going to say. I sat there next to him, trying to think of something to say, and then.
""You know, the first time I met you, I thought you were really weird."" Rohan spoke as he looked out at the bonfire, the flickering flames reflected in his eyes. WHAAAAAAT IS HAPPENING. My brain shut down as I sat there, barely processing what he said, until I heard the six words that would change my life.
""You know I like you Natalie?""
I leaned my head onto his shoulder and closed my eyes, and spoke  softly.
""I love you too Rohan.""

"   They laid there in an open field of daisies with their arms resting beneath their head, as they looked up at the night sky full of stars. He looked over at her as she stared up in awe at the glow radiating from each individual star. He smiled, looking at her goofy grin and her breathtaking hazel eyes and the way they saw the world with such positivity and optimism. She turned her head to look at him, with that same contagious, goofy grin. 

   ""What,"" she asked with a light laugh. 
   ""Nothing,"" he answered, his smile widening. 
   ""Tell me!"" she said giving his chest a light shove.

   He took a breath, ""you're just amazing."" he replied, as he looked into her eyes.

   Her smile became shy and she sat up, looking away from his gaze.

   ""I'm not,"" she said staring down, avoiding his capturing eyes.

   ""Lily?"" he called as he sat up. 
   ""Mm?"" she responded.

   He wrapped his arms around her waist. Sliding her brown hair away from her neck, he gently kissed it. 

  ""You are,"" he whisperedas he slowly moved her blouse down to kiss her shoulder. 

   She lightly smiled and turned to face him. He looked at her, his eyes waiting for her mouth to say something; for her to do something.

   ""Mike?"" she said. 
   ""Yeah?"" he held his breath. 

   She leaned forward and kisses him. Surprised, he fell back onto the picnic basket behind him. They both started chuckling as Mike moved the basket away from underneath him and pushed the remainig of the fallen food items aside. He looked back at her and in that moment, everything was perfect.  

  Her hair fell at such a nice angle around her face. Her eyes stood out and engulfed all of his attention. The chill of the night set a cozy mood for the two.

   ""I love you, Mike."" she softly stated, not breaking eye contact this time. 

  He smiled and quickly kissed her, capturing her face lightly in his hands. 

   As he broke his lips away from her for a split second he whispered quietly, ""I love you so much, Lily.""

"   ""What did you call me?"" he barked. 
   
   Laila walked up to the man and slapped him with all get energy. This action left the man in shock and with a large cut bleeding on his cheek. He snapped his head to glare at her.  
 
   ""I want my stuff back creep. You messed with the wrong girl, old man."" Laila exclaimed as she uneasily moved from side to side, waiting for the man's response to her righteousness. 

   To her surprise, the man began to laugh uncontrollably. Laila was now completely puzzled and her expression showed it. 

   ""Wha-"" she began but was interrupted by a heavy hand smashing her face into the nearby brick wall. 
 
   As she tried to regain some composer, she took two fingers and felt her head as a gush of red liquid ran down her face. A look at her fingers confirmed she was bleeding; a lot. She licked her lips to taste more blood. Turning around once again led to another head throbbing punch into the pavement making her vision blur and her ears begin to ring. Laila's eyes became heavy and her body felt weak as she gathered enough strength to attempt an escape from the old man.   

   She crawled backwards towards the opening of the alley as fast as her feet and hands would move. Moving her head and body from side to side avoiding as many of the man's swings as possible. One specific blow to the stomach left her frozen and clutching her gut, as she felt she had broken some ribs. The man's breathing became exasperated and tired as he slowed down his pace and his punches became more aimless. With a horse and shaky voice, Laila called out for the man to stop. He ignored the plead and continued to throw his arms at her. She took a deep breath and screamed as loud as she could, startling the man. This gave her enough time to grab a nearby rock and chuck it at the old man. She didn't look back to see if it had hit him as her blood covered fingers grasped her phen lying a few feet away. She struggled to get to her feet but even when she did the pain in her gut overwhelmed her. She limped toward the opening, stumbling, as her eyes could not focus on a single set point and became heavier then before. 
 
   As she ran out, she didnt notice a man walking down the street and walked right into him. Laila stepped back, scared and startled, she kept her head down. The man's hand caught her and the touch made her jump a bit. The man looked at the person he'd bumped into and his eyes became wide. 

   ""Laila, what- what happened to you?"" Marcus's beautiful accent touched her ears and she abruptly looked up. 
 
   Her eyes became wide and she turned around to an empty area that once held the dirty old man. She again turned to Marcus and put her head back down to look at the ground.

   ""Nothing."" she tried to tell him, bit no sound came out.

   Eyes wide, her hand shot to her throat and her eyebrows came together in a concerned manner. She tried to utter a word- any word but failed to. Seeing Laila clearly in distress and hurt he asked her again, what had happened. Laila shook her head and frowned. 

   ""Alright, well we need to get you to a hospital. You need medical attention,"" calmly told her, putting his hand on her shoulder. 

  He put his hands around her shoulders and attempter to help her walk, making her clutch her stomach tighter.

  ""I'm sorry, I'm going to just carry you, okay? The hospital is only 3 blocks away from here."" Marcus told her. 

   Just like that, he pit his arm under Laila's shaking legs and swept her up. She gladly  wrapped her arms around his neck and rested her head on his strong shoulder.  Marcus began to walk as Laila felt herself beginning to doze off. 

   ""No."" Marcus began. ""Laila, you have to stay awake. Of you have a concussion, you have to stay awake okay? Its just 10 minutes, 15 tops. Just stay with me until then, alright?"" 

   She looked at him, even though her vision was still blurry, she looked right into his eyes and could tell he was genuinely concerned. So she nodded and took a deep breath looking forward. 

   ""This is not going to be over anytime soon,"" she thought. She wasn't wrong; not by a long shot.

"   After giving the Graivelles a tour of the 5 bedroom, 4 bathroom Victorian, Laila shook each of their hands again but avoided any eye contact with Marcus. She added a final nod before turning around and hurrying down the street. 
   
   You see, Laila had recently been in a relationship that had ended badly and was not looking for anything new at the moment. Even though there was a strong temptation to with her recent encounter, she was determined to not let it get to her. 

   As she walked down an alleyway which was covered in overturned garbage cans and broken glass bottles, she looked down at her phone, not realizing she had walked right into a man. The man looked to be about 45 years old and had a long brown beard to match his disheveled hair which had begun to turn gray and looked as though it was fairly dirty and unkept. His baggy clothes had many holes and unsual colored stains covering the majority of his once white shirt and denim blue jeans. 

   Laila had an uneasy feeling so she kept her eyes down and mumbled an apologize. Before she had a chance to take another step, the man grabbed her arm. Laila heard a long rrriiiiiippp and looked down to see a large slash in the arm of her dress. Her mouth hung open as she looked up at the man.

   ""Someone so pretty and fancy lookin' don't have no business walkin' down here,"" he said creeping closer to her with every word. 

His breath reeked of chicken and his teeth looked rotten and chipped. 

   ""O-okay, I'll go then,"" she managed to yank her arm back as she spoke. 

   She desperately ran down the alley, trying not to fall or let the man catch up to her.

   ""Hey!"" he called out. 

   Laila did not turn around, but she could hear the loud stomps of his boots coming behind her. She tried to run quicker. Unfortunately, the heel of her right shoe gave out and she fell to the ground, dropping her purse and phone. All her belongings scattered across the pathway. Then man slowed his pace but continued to walk in her direction. He leaned down and picked up a roll of money and a pack of gum. 

   ""This should do,"" he said before getting up and walking in the other direction. 

   She should've just left it there, but she couldn't. She took off her left shoe and flung it into a near by garbage bin. 

   ""Hey creep!"" she yelled. 

   The man stopped and turned around slowly as she held her breath.

"so heres the story (its rlly long but i think its a good one), i went to this party and everyone got super wasted to the point where this perv was trying to force me to dance with him and i kept trying to push him away, my friends kept trying to get him off me and he wouldnt let me go, so this random guy comes up and gets him off me and tells him to stop touching me and proceeds to take me outside (huzzah! my prince charming!). So i felt like a damsel in distress who just got saved and felt rlly grateful to this dude, lets call him paul. So then i realized paul had come up to me earlier (i was drunk earlier as well) and we were hardcore flirting, the sexual tension was off the chang, anyway i recognized him but didnt comment, i said thanks and asked him his name and whatnot and when i tried to tell him stuff about me, he just cut me off and said yeah i know you and then he told me my name and my friends name, what university im in, he said that we had a class together (i had no idea) and a bunch of other stuff, he even said he liked me, so it was kinda stalkerish and also kinda sweet.

 So i felt flattered and made out with him and people (including my friend) were watching us so i told him to go with me to the bathroom where we could make out in peace, in the bathroom things got rlly heated and he took out a condom, i said we wouldnt need it because we werent having sex, he told me he was virgin (which was surpising because hes like 21, and pretty cute), i told him youre not losing your virginity in a bathroom so he just kept on kissing me and he put me against the wall and dry humped me so i let him get to first base and then he pulled my pants down and tried to give me oral but i didnt let him, by now his pants were down as well and he kept insisting we have sex so i told him id give him a bj to get him off and i did and that was pretty much it. Afterwards he said thank you (awkward) and i told him that this had to stay between us. 

When we got out of the bathroom the party was over and we had no ride home so we got in the car with some of his friends and they were gonna take me home, one of them was rlly cute and flirted with me but i didnt rlly do anything and neither did paul. So we all went to mcdonalds and he basically acted like nothing happened and ignored me. His friend dropped him off at his house first and he got out and didnt say bye or anything. Monday in college, everyone knew that we had made out, and he told everyone we had sex when we didnt!!!!!!!!! Lo and behold, paul was really popular at my university, i didnt know it because he was older than me and was a semester ahead, but i was taking extra classes to get ahead and he was in one of them. So to my horrible luck, come monday morning everyone in the semester above knew who i was, and i had lied to my friends and told them nothing happened, but they found out and so did all the other civil engineers (if you didnt guess, i major in civil engineering and so does he). I got bullied, everyone thought i was a slut, people i didnt even know would call his name out at me whenever i walked by, and this went on for at least 2 months if not more. When people met me, theyd immediately ask, arent you the girl that hooked up with paul at that party??
 
Meanwhile, i had a class with him and the teacher put us together in a group project!! So in this project there were 3 friends of his, 1 mutual friend and the two of us. He did absolutely everything to avoid me and did nothing at all on the project!! His friends got rlly mad at him for not participating even though im guessing they knew he was avoiding me because everyone thought we had a one night stand. I ended becoming rlly good friends with them even though they didnt believe me when i told them we didnt have sex. 

So now a new semester is starting and hes now in 2 of my classes, i have no idea what to do or anything. He keeps ignoring me and i hate him for it, i dont want him to be my bf i just wish i didnt feel this horrible feelin everytime i see him. I know he hates me but i cant figure out why, i should hate him for telling everyone we had sex, and i did for a really long time, but now i dont care anymore, the bullying is over, he gave me a rlly bad reputation but at least i got kinda popular over it (im a shy girl thats never been the center of attention). Sometimes i see him and i wish we could be friends, i know i should talk to him, but i cant, he doesnt put himself in situations where he can talk to me, the douchebag hates my fucking guts. Only once was i in a situation where i could talk to him but i kept waiting for him to talk to me, to apologize, or to just say hey and act normal, but he cant even look me in the eyes, he just kept staring at his phone, so i left. I really want to get over this and put it behind since it was like 6 months ago, but i cant help it everytime i see him in class i feel hate, regret, remorse and a bit of longing. Prior to the sexual activity i thought he was perfect, i was actually into him and he was into me. Like i said i dont want him to be my boyfriend, i just want to not walk into a room and feel immediately nervouse because hes there, or feel like i have to impress him so that he can see what he missed out on. I wish i didnt care. 

Whats wrong with me? what should i do? Is he a douche? Am i a drama queen? why do i want him to liek me when i know hes a jerk?",romance

"   She wore a red velvet, button up dress that hugged each of her curves perfectly. Black strappy heels she walked confidently in and a strong red lipstick that needs no further explanation. With her red and black Marc Jacobs hand bag at her side, Laila Moon was ready for her next job; helping the abnoxiously uptight couple who lived next door, finally find a house far, far away from her. 
She looked down at her phone walking straight through the loud honks and shouts that came with living in the one and only, New York City. Without looking up and with her black hair whipping in her face, Laila managed to successfully manuver around every (loud) man, women, and street vendor without a single confrontation. She turned a corner walked down the chipped sidewalk, sending the couple, Mr. And Mrs. Graivelle a final text confirming their last house tour. 

   'Please, please like this one,' she thought desperately as she hit the send button. 

   As she looked up, she saw them in the distance. Putting on her best fake smile, she walked up to meet the couple in front of a large Victorian old brick house. Although, this time they were joined by another man who faced the brick house as she approached. 

   ""Hi Mr. and Mrs. Graivelle,"" she said greeting the two with a graceful handshake. 

The man finally turned around and Laila's expression slightly changed. 

   ""Wow."" she thought, her eyes wide and fixated on him. 

   Just like his deep ocean blue eyes, which were wide with surprise. The man looked to be about 28 years old, only 2 years older than she was. They continued to look at each other, his face showing hints of curiosity and hers absolutely in awe. Just as the staring began to go on for a bit too long, Mrs. Graivelle cleared her throat loudly and gave each of them a stern look. 

   ""Miss Moon, this is our nephew, Marcus he is going to view the house with us today."" Her frown deepening as she spoke. 

   ""Of course, its nice to meet you. My name is Laila Moon, I'm your aunt and uncles' real estate agent."" She looked down, embarrassed by her unprofessional behavior. 

   She shook Marcus' hand, noticing a little zap as she felt his warm hand touch hers. Her eyes shot up at the feeling to capture his expression, it remained unchanged.

   'Stop it Laila, you're a professional,' she thought. 

   He nodded. 

   ""It's nice to meet you too, Miss Moon,"" he replied, revealing a strong Irish accent which only intrigued Laila even more.

   'Be strong!' She thought and shook any 'unprofessional' thoughts from her mind. 

   She fixed her posture and walked with the same confidence she had minutes before meeting Marcus. He followed close behind, while his aunt and uncle shared a look of disapproval at their nephew's interaction with their real estate agent.

"I'm in eight grade (I assume some of you will be either leaving now or waiting to laugh your ass off at my ""silly"" predicament) and I've really liked this girl since sixth grade. I'll admit that at the start I just thought she was pretty and stuff, and I knew she would never like me back because she's . . . y'know . . . THAT girl. The girl that just makes you feel good when you see her. When she decides to talk to you back, for whatever reason, you feel like the king of the world. She's one of the most popular girls at our school, but not only because she's extremely gorgeous and tall. She's so fantastically sweet, one of the smartest people I know, and she's incredibly mature. I'm just so head over heals for her. She never escapes my mind. I'm always thinking about what it would be like to hold her in my arms, and say ""I do"". I know middle school relationships are stupid and all, but I just want to be with her. And not exactly in a romantic way. I want to talk to her, and be friends with her, and just BE WITH HER. Every time I try to talk to her I end up entering a very awkward conversation, saying something stupid or inappropriate in which she disapproves of. Because of my failure to talk to her and the fact that I know that she doesn't like me back (and she found out that I liked her, somehow) lately I've been in a very depressing state. It may also be because of the fact that the frontman of one of my favorite bands (Chester Bennington of Linkin Park) passed away, or my height and weight problems, the fact that my parents have been fighting an awful lot, or that my cousins are in prison for about the next decade. I know I real sorrowful guy isn't a turn on. I just want to become friends with her, but I am socially awkward and she's the popular girl I can usually never muster up enough strength to talk to on the bus. But I'm also mentoring her younger brother so I think that may be a plus? Either way I just need help.

"So I happened to hear from an old boyfriend a few months ago after not hearing from him in years. We almost got married when we where younger. We really hit it off again, but we where both married and he had a girlfriend. Now we are both getting a divorce for different reasons. He is seeing his girlfriend now but still talks to me he even tells me things he would never tell her like how he wants to have sex with other ladys. We talk for hours every day. This is a very weird relationship and I don't know how to deal with it. I have feelings for him and he even says he wants to have a relationship, but then almost in the same breath he talks about how much he loves his girlfriend he left his wife for. He tells me I am his best friend, and his girlfriend would get mad if she found out we where talking. My emotions are all mixed up I like having him for a friend, but sometimes feelings get mixed up and I want more. Then I think about what an idiot I would be to even start a relationship with someone who can't stay faithful. I just don't know what to do.. should i just tell him to leave and never contact me again or try to just stay friends and hope I can keep these feelings to myself.",romance
"I'm going to start from the beginning:

There's this girl that I'm practically in love with. It was love at first sight seriously. We met on a school  (college) retreat that she lead. It was a religious trip, but I did what I could and flirted where I could to show her I had interest. On the retreat one night the 2 of us stayed up until like 3am just talking. That was the moment I realized I had such deep feelings for her. Retreat ends and summer begins.

A few weeks into summer I invited her to coffee. We went out to coffee, but it proceeded to turn into a longer evening together. On the retreat she mentioned she had never paddled boarded but always wanted to go. So I took her paddle boarding. Then we walked around all night. It was special for at least me. 

A few weeks later (this Monday) I invited her on a picnic. I told her don't bring anything except dessert if she wants to bring something, because I wanted to plan the whole thing. She loves books and roses. So, I setup the whole picnic speakers, food, and in the middle of the blanket was my favorite book with a rose in it. Again we talked all night and it was literally the perfect night to me. Before she left we kissed and I gave her the bouquet of of roses.

Wednesday was her friends birthday. Her friend wanted to go to the bar that I always go to on Wednesday so we planned to meet up there. Which we did. Once I met her I told her she forgot a few things at the picnic the other day. So we walked to my car holding holding hands. Once we got to my car we made out for about an hour or 2. 

The next day we talked on the phone for like 3 hours. While talking on the phone she told me that she still had feelings for her ex. But also told me that her ex didn't think good morning text mattered, and that no one had ever took her on a picnic like I did. The next morning proceeded to send her a good morning text.

Friday she invited me over to her house. I met majority of her family. All of them greeted me by name and seemed pretty excited to meet me. Her brother in law took me to the side and gave me ""the tough guy talk"" and he told me that she likes me. I stayed until 4am. We walked around her neighborhood holding hands, kissed, snuggled together under the stars, and she fell asleep in my arms. That same night she told me she thinks I'm too good for her.

Saturday and Sunday, barely any talking/texting and invited her to dinner and she replied with an ""I don't know.""

I'm so lost guys. I genuinely think I love this girl. I think about her all day and night. I try my hardest to not flood her with text. I am completely head over heels for this girl. But I don't understand what's happening? I need help and advice. Am I pressing too hard?

"Before Reddit was the bomb diggity of the net, there was Craigslist. The following is something I posted there that I know will get lost in the debauchery that Craigslist has become, but I hope it reaches at least a few people here:

This was the title that peeked the interest of my late husband almost 7 years ago. I couldn't tell you what I wrote in the body of that rant/rave, but whatever it was led to a first date and we were glued together from then until the day he passed.

Craigslist has gone downhill rapidly since then (it wasn't exactly a pillar of the community at that time), but on what would have been our 5th anniversary, I felt it cathartic symmetry to post here. (The copious amounts of alcohol I have consumed had nothing to do with this decision.)

My husband was unique and irreplaceable. Our love story defied the odds in epic ways. His death was long and ugly (FUCK cancer), but his heart goes on.

just for us
right for us
best for us
only for us

I love the life we've made.

Happy Anniversary to the one who has my heart.

Those are the words on the last anniversary card I will ever receive. I have no idea when he bought it as planning ahead for things like that wasn't his forte, but he had it hidden well in a place I would never look. He hadn't signed it, but he had bought it.

So, for those brave, drunk or bored enough to read this, if you have someone who has your heart, hold them tight. Love them like you're going to lose them because the fact is that none of us know when we will go. He never thought he would lose the battle. The doctors gave him 2-4 months, he made it 2 weeks. He didn't even know where he was at the end. You think you know how things will play out, but none of us do.

Hold him tight, always kiss her goodnight, orgasms get rid of headaches. Never go to sleep angry, always kiss each other goodbye, be the first to say your sorry. Put each other first and you will know a happiness beyond your wildest dreams.

Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow that I shall say good night till it be morrow.

"
In a house that looked more like a cabin in the woods than a cottage in the small town, Gale was about to close the windows of his small pharmacy that overlooked the carriage paved cobbled street. He flipped over the open sign to his “Hulder Herbology.” His neighbors were also closing their shops and market stalls, while people who came from a remoter part of the country side prepared to dump their home-grown produce or other commodities back in their wagon. They would have to cross the Rotun hill before it gets really dark and God knows what fairies or changelings will come out. Gale quietly waited for the mandarine orange sky overlooking the humble town of Fullgreens to be peppered with indigo blue specks of the dark, eyeing the ghost of a moon in the baby blue.

Gale finally shut the windows and turned around to see the back of his assistant who made absolutely no noise as she put back the dry herbs to their own small designated cupboards and cleaned their little rustic laboratory.



In contrast with Gale who was taller then average farmers who lived in the stretch from New Jersey to the south of Virginia, his assistant was a tiny, petite woman who looked no older than twenty. She wore a grey cap over her black hair that was styled into a modest, if seen in negative light–prudish, old fashioned bun that Gale has no idea how she tied into without those lacy nets that are all the rage. When she finally turned around to catch her superior looking at her, her dark eyes stared back with their characteristic alertness.

Ever the observant scholar, Gale was puzzled. They’ve lived and worked in his pharmacy that was also his home for about a week now, but he could never fathom any kind of meaning in her translucent eyes.

He can never gauge his alien-looking assistant’s intentions when she stares at him with such a pure of an expression, her glassy stare. She was not a hostile creature ever, as she is a bunny rabbit who he turned human in exchange for her services, but her bold pinning stare hardly won her a reputation as a proper lady. But Gale mused,

‘But the truth is that rabbits’ faces never ever change. So Michaela’s demeanor must have simply transferred to her human state.’

It was only after Gale stopped musing over Michaela’s deep chasms of ink that he began to see her round, smooth contour of her face, pink pert mouth, and honey-beige skin the townspeople called “mustard dyed” or “spun oat meal”.

"Hi redditors, 

I'm in a situation where I met the most beautiful woman I've ever laid eyes on. We graduated from the same university and were just hanging out in town until we both found careers. 

We met on tinder and had some amazing nights out before I had to leave for a week for work and a job interview. Before I left she texted me things like ""Why didn't I meet you a long time ago?"" and in person, told me to hurry back. 

Well, I got that job from the interview (very excited) and will be positioned in Harrisburg (Pennsylvania's capital, small city, not what this girl who grew up in Las Vegas would consider exciting). 

She's already planned to move back home (Vegas) at the end of the month until she finds a job in a place she'll enjoy. 

I see her every once in a while for a pool day or to bring her dinner before she goes to work but she seems to be distancing herself to avoid being hurt. 

I really want her to come with me, but am struggling because if I ask, I may just scare her away forever. 

I lose sleep when she doesn't text me back. I've cut ties with every other girl I used to hook up with before I met her. I would give everything I own just to be able to call her mine. 

How do I go about asking this girl to move to a place I know she won't enjoy for a guy she's only been seeing a few weeks?

It took time for me to realize it. But now it was March. The damage was done. I decided to apologize to her. In April, I slowly started hanging out with her popular guy and girl friends. I made her laugh. I follow her on Instagram, though she does not follow me back. She has a Finsta which she did not accept my request to follow, and she didn't add me back on Snapchat.

I Dmed her a few times and no answer. But we were finally in good terms around May. But it all had me depressed. Then on the last day of school, I gave her a bracelet I had bought for her from a recent trip. She wouldn't take it, and she ran to the girl's bathroom to avoid me. Finally when she came out she took it and I cracked one last joke and made her and her friends laugh. That was pretty bad. But then one week later, she made a live stream on Instagram, and she kept talking to me and she joked that I was the love of her life and she asked me where I had gotten the bracelet from. About one hour later, her friend made a live stream. She and the girl I like were at some guy's birthday party. The girl I like thanked me for the bracelet, she joked that she loved me, and winked.

I got Tinder on my phone just because, but I'm kinda afraid to message people because I'm afraid every time I talk to someone new, I look like a creep and a weirdo. And even if I want to talk to someone who I'd want to try(?) out a date with, I automatically think ""they think I'm a creep/they're already taken"", so I don't try.

There were signs in the first month that the relationship wouldn't work but you were my one that got away and I was sure that you were brought back into my life for good purpose, side not I suppose you definitely were just not for the reason that I thought. I had dreams and plans and goals even in the beginning but you were still stuck figuring out how you were going to beat your batsman video game. I could tell you wished you had dreams too but instead of coming up with your own you just piggy backed onto mine and we went on for the ride. 
I wanted greatness for you, the greatness that I very well knew you were so capable of, I wanted you to be a teacher or a rocket scientist or a roofer, I wanted you to find your niche no matter what that was, but you never cared enough to put the energy forth because you were fine with the day to day whatever is in front of me I'll deal with it attitude. 
For so long I pushed you and tried to get you to do the great things I knew you were capable of and instead of taking the initiative you pushed back harder until I just couldn't do it anymore. I loved you even more than you loved yourself and that was the inevitable cause of our demise. 
Year 3 is when I really started to resent you, the way you talked, the way you laughed, your crude childish humor, it all became such a nuisance to me. What I once thought were cute quirks had because the main factor of my annoyance. I did everything that I could for you, I filled out every job application, made every phone call, handled anything you asked me to because I think maybe I hoped that one day you would actually appreciate it. You didn't. You never would have. 
You were sweet to me, you did nice things for me from time to time and apparently that was supposed to be enough, apparently thag made you some great guy. I would have thrown away every gift or bouquet of flowers you got for me a hundred times over if it meant you actually taking initiative and being the best you that you could be like I was trying to do so that in turn it would have made me that much more motivated to be the best version of myself. 
You brought me down, and that's not entirely your fault because I suppose that I let you. You acted like you were the greatest guy that would ever come into my life and after awhile I started to wonder if I was the one who was expecting too much, I started to question myself. It wasn't me. 
Thanks for trying but you really didn't. You didn't try for me or us because you never tried for yourself.

"I think Nicholas Sparks would be proud of me. I always thought his stories were far out there but recently I decided to try and make one for myself (one day) and I decided to share for the sake of progress keeping. My story starts when I met him in such UNLIKELY ways that Im still in awe and grateful for. Anyways, when we met we clicked instantly and I knew I met a soul mate, regardless of his status as lover, friend, brother, etc. Now... our closeness inevitably translated to romance but... we broke up from a LDR relationship of 2 years for he lost his feelings. Reasons? Well there are many but from what I understand, its self sabotage. It really hurts but vie moved on with my heart still aching as I wish for his presence for he was more than just a S/O. We talked every day and we guided one another. I can't let that go. I know the cliche, ""met the right person at the wrong time"" and I believe it. Now I won't let him misguide me, Ill make new lovers, new friends, etc but then one day, i'm going to be a fuckin successful person with whole new experiences and Ill see him again. Hopefully, (I wish nothing more to see him grow-- im just sad I wont be there every step of the way...) he will too and maybe we can start over? Maybe our changes will allow us to be ""different"" people meeting again as strangers? Not necessarily as S/Os but as best friends... whatever category he is for me. I just love him so much and he knows that for he recognizes that no one will love him as unconditionally as I do. Anyways they say, ""when you love something, let it go, and if its meant to be yours, it'll return."" Well, hopefully that's true. Ill let anyone who sees this know in a few years.",romance

"So there's this girl and she just makes me feel good (we're 7th grade btw). I like her a lot, and I have for over a year. But there's a catch - she's . . . her. Popular, extremely pretty, quite a few inches taller than me (but I'll catch up soon). Also, I have quite the reputation of being a little innapropiate and vulgar. And once, I said ""damnit"" on the bus and she gave me a dissaproving look. Anyway, I really want to be with her, but I don't know if she wants to be with me. I just beed tips on what to do to talk to (she is always with some of her friends, one of which really dislikes me) so it will be hard for me to get her alone.

My wife mentioned that a friend at worked was talking about having a three way with a couple of guys a while ago. I've been interested in trying this with her for a while now. We had one of her girlfriends joins us not too long ago and it was great! This is something she's kind of jokingly hinted at in the past. We have an anniversary coming up and I'm thinking about setting something up. Only thing is: I don't know anybody we'd both be interested in and to be honest I'd rather it be somebody from out of town. A one night stand kind of thing. K have no idea where to even begin trying to find another male partner for her though. Any advice? ,romance
"I meet my friend in college, and we hit it off right off the bat, we are both into the same shows, play the same games, have the same sense of humor. She's the type of friend that you can have for life. At first, that's all I wanted was to be friends with her.

It was great up until now, recently she's all I can think of, and I realized that I like her more than a friend when it was the first time we were going to hang out outside of college, I was so nervous, I clean my apartment like 3 times, checked my makeup god knows how many times. it wasn't until we later on in the day when I found out that they aren't straight, and some of the things they are into (sexually) and since then they have been on my mind constantly.

I want to tell them how I feel but I'm too afraid of getting rejected and it ruining our current friendship. I can handle the rejection but it's the underlying fear that it could ruin out friendship, I know they are a very mature person but at the same time, we are both slightly awkward people...

I will also add this is the first time I have ever truly liked a person for who they are, I'm normally in 'relationships' for purely for sexual reasons, I generally like them as a person.
Do i tell them about my feelings or let is fizzle out ???????????",romance
"I've known her for over 25 years.  First love, first everything.  I was a military child and moved - ultimately falling out of contact for 18 years.  A small reunion (of sorts) about 6 years ago that seemed to reignite that fire that never really went out inside, but both of us were married - though the attraction was certainly there.

I traveled to her town to see her and help her out with a major event and things went well, though some other things could have ruined everything.

Now we are just 6 days away from traveling to a neutral location to spend time alone and I'm just about shaking.  I know I have nothing to worry about, and she repeatedly tells me I am the only one she wants; the only one she loves.  

So, why do I feel so scared.  This is a great opportunity for us to connect, so I should be happily excited.  I am, but I feel like I could pass out sometimes.",romance
"When i first dating my bf, i really like him. So much that i want to be with him everytime &amp; anywhere. I want him to be happy thats why i gave him my virginity.

Tell me, is it wrong to be so in love that i dont wanna anyone else to touch me, only him can and him only or should i search a new substitute? Why did he felt unhappy?

"Hey all,

Today I was out shopping for some trainers, I was talking to this store assistant and she was beautiful, funny and we had loads in common. I kinda panicked and ended up buying some really ugly trainers and walking out. 

Now, I was gonna return the trainers next week (when she works) and ask for her number then. So, two questions:

1) is that a good idea?

2) is asking for someone's number lost on people in their early 20s? I'm 20 and she's probs around 20-22 so I'm a little worried asking for someone's number is a little weird. (In the UK, not sure if that makes a difference)",romance

"As I sweat in the gym finishing a new PR on deadlifts, not that it was impressive but I looked like a solid 5/10 that day.... I have Red hair and freckles. Anywho, I was in the gym and I gave my number to this girl. The back story is as followed. 
After I was finished with a circuit workout, (no I am not a cross fit guy but I just wanted to trim my belly), I was getting the wipes to get my mat sanitized. I went to the wall mount to grab a wipe and this girl asked me to keep time for her while she did hand stand against the wall. In the gym were two females, two other males all resting between there reps. I was sweating like a wild beast that just got done running through a sauna in Doha, Qatar in July, so I was like yeah sure whatever. Internally I was like holy smokes yes I'll do anything but on the outside I was like, yeah that's cool. So she does hand stand and says to tell her every ten seconds that pass, which led to a minute total. After the fact, I said very mono toned, ""Good Job,"" as she replied Thanks. I then said my name is Jake btw, while whatever her name was, was lost while I gazed into the windows of her soul. I then wiped down my Mat and proceeded to leave. After I was just about out the door she looked me dead in the eyes and said have a goodnight. I wanted to just keep walking, as a ginger I knew I didn't have a chance with this beauty. So I walked away until I met a new friend in the gym, and I asked him for a pen and paper as well as some quick advice. We both agreed that I should give her my number, so I walked back in the cardio room, with a a folded up piece of paper and said, "" I hope I'm not too forward, but here is my number. Have a good night."" So I walked away and it has been two days and I usually abide by the three day rule. No I don't just want to send her a pic of my male genitalia!!! I want to just gaze into her soul while she gazes back into my empty region where mine should be and not say a word while I look at her beautiful face. Anyways, I'll probably never get a text back, but I felt like sharing. Any advice or comments just leave em or message me or whatever, I'm new to reddit and I like talking to the world while no one ever seems to read mhm message ( I've tired word press once or twice).

Have a 20 year anniversary next year and I want to take my wife on a nice week long all inclusive vacation in June. We both love the beach idea.

"I came to the realization when i met Her.
Everything that is me longs to be with her every hour of the day.
All that she is: is perfect with me.
I dont want her to change, nor do i wish to tie her down and own her.
But i want her to be free, 
To know that it is me, that i am her shelter, her nest where she can rest her head, her worries.
I want her for the rest of my life. And
When she has grown grey, when the light in her eyes has dimmed, when her bones ache
And our loved ones have moved on and away,
I will admire her beauty.
When she is 94 years old it will be as though she were 17 in my eyes... For i know now, Radzeatul,
You are my light.
I have now understood what Love is, and continue to be amazed by it.
You will probably never read this,
Never feel as i do,
Never long for me as i for you.
But i will always love you... Always and Forever.",romance

"Hi All. I am a married female with a lovable husband and I am interested in finding another girl in our relationship but I am unable to do so. We are not you Ken and Barbie but we are not homely either..lol... I have been in search of someone for many years with no luck. I hear about other couples that have another girl in their relationship but can not for the life of me know how they do it. 

Here is more about us. We are both middle aged and very easy going and discrete. We are diseased and drug free. We dont do the bar stuff so finding someone at a bar is not us. We both work with the public and know a lot of people and want this lifestyle of ours to be discrete as well.. We are from a small town in Central Pennsylvania.

Yes I know we know a lot of people but everyone is either already married, not into this lifestyle or just not attractive at all. 

Some explain to me how I am able to find a girl to join us in our lifestyle please. We are not interested in joining any paid personal website or non-working spam sites. ",romance

"Building a relationship with an abundance of Romance is something everyone thinks about, but few people do. Perhaps it's because they actually can't think of exactly what to do. With a hectic work schedule, family engagements and a busy lifestyle those of us often put it on the back burner. "" She knows I love her.. RIght? "" "" He appreciates what I do for him."" Here are ten ""acts of love"" that you can do with and for your partner to bring a little more romance into your relationship. Not only will this help the bond between you stronger, but It will also show your partner that you are there for the long haul.  
 
1. Make your mornings special by bringing your partner a cup of coffee while he or she is still in bed. If you have time to splurge breakfast in bed is always a pick me up aswell.  It will make your partner feel cherished and the kindness will be returned. 
2. Make time to spend together. Don’t let work and a busy life keep you from spending quality time with your partner. Try planning a romantic rendezvous during the week. Just the anticipation of being together will add spark to your romantic life. 
3. Before you leave in the morning tell your partner that you are looking forward to seeing them when you return. Never leave the house without acknowledging your partner or saying, ""I love you."" This also goes for evenings aswell, never go to bed Angry or without telling your partner how much they mean to you.  
4. If your partner is having a Rough day, try a night out. Pick a low key restaurant and spend time to unwind. Give them the opportunity to relax and feel pampered knowing that you are there for them through the good and the bad. 
5. Whenever you can, take the time to give your partner 100% of your attention when they want to talk to you. Remove all distractions, sit and listen without commenting. Let your partner know that you hear what they are saying and wait for them to finish to reply. Your partner may not need you to Fix a problem, they just want someone to listen to them. 
6. Be spontaneous, hire a babysitter and make a weekend trip to a park. Rent a hotel room and spend time together with no other distractions. Write "" I love you "" on the mirror in the bathroom after a hot shower. The small things are the most important. Its not the money that you spend, it’s the time and effort you put in that will count. 
7. Take the time to tell your partner that they look wonderful, beautiful, sexy or great. We all have doubts about our looks and hearing that we are attractive to our partners is a very important part of creating a romantic relationship.  
8. Next time you are shopping alone, get a couple of little ""surprise gifts"" for your partner. The next time he or she is feeling down, give them one of the gifts. They don’t have to be extremely expensive.  
9. A hug and a kiss is just what the doctor ordered after a long busy day. You will both feel more deeply connected throughout the evening. Also remember to touch your partner affectionately throughout the day, not just when you want to be romantic. 
10. This one is terribly romantic, so don't try it unless you're ready for a passionate evening. Write the reasons you love your partner on Index cards and place them throughout the house. They place 2 Roses on the bed to signify the "" Present  "" and "" Future "". Let your partner read each card that shows the many ways and reasons you love the person that they are.  Your partner will never forget your thoughtfulness. 
These ideas are just a little help to get you started. Once you get going, more ideas will come to you on their own. Don’t attempt to all of them in a week. Just explore your options. People often think that once there is commitment the dating stops. Once there is marriage the romance and courting ends. This could not be farther from the truth. Continue to date your partner or spouse every day of your life. Show them that they made the right choice by choosing you and that you will never take there love for granted.  
Taking the time to create romance in your relationship is Vital. Every day should feel like the honeymoon and in 40 years you can say that your love is stronger than ever.

For me I was 6 in school, there was a girl in my class called Jessica that had the brightest blue eyes ever, we were playing tag in the playground and ran into each other I grabbed her to stop her falling and she half grabbed/hugged me back to stop herself falling at that point the bell went (the school had a rule that when the bell went everyone had to freeze like statues) she smiled and said ""oh well I guess we have to stay like this now"" that was the day I discovered girls.

I've had this friend for 4 years and have had a crush for three. I've told her how I feel a few times but she either tries to brush it off like I didn't say anything or she turned me down the first time. I asked her to prom but she said yes and then asked as friends but then I told her that's not what I wanted and she turned me down. But it's been a while since I've tried anything and I'm not sure if she's into me or not but I moved provinces and last weekend she came up to go to the bars here and just ended up hanging with me and my friends. I'm not sure how she feels about me and I can't think of a romantic thing to do that would apply to our situation. If anyone can shed any light on how she may feel or what a good move would be that would be much appreciated.,romance
"I don't know what it is but I always seem to be led back to you. As if I'm only levelling up in a game. No matter the disagreement. No matter the time or place. Something always brings us back to each other. It must be Synchronicity. 
Synchronicity meaning in this phrase to mean you are my destiny and have some sort of purpose. But what? 
After knowing you since you were 6 what is the reason. 
We flirt, we get nervous to meet and we fall out then almost at the same time of year and by some chance we will bump into each other, or someone will send a message. 
Yet I am scared. 
Of what exactly I do not know but I know I'm some way we are meant to be.
